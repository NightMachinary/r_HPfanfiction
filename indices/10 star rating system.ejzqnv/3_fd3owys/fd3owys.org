Meta is for talking about the sub rather than talking to the sub. You would use it for example if you said there are far too many prompt posts and I really wish we had a weekly limit since they're reducing the amount of interest I have in the sub.

Misc is for when you're not quite sure where it would all go. Maybe you want a discussion but you're also asking for fics that fit the discussion whilst recommending one or two yourself.
