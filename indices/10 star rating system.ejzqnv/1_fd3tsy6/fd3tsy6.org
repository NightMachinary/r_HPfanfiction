You vastly overestimate the tastes of the average reader. Keep in mind that a lot of the "popular" stories on FFN are tropefests with lots of bashing and a lot of the popular stories on Ao3 are porn. A star-based rating system would add very little unless you somehow create an elite pool of reviewers, which would just circlejerk according to their own tastes.
