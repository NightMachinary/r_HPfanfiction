[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925), is extremely well written and super sad, but ends on a happy and hopeful note. Ron is unfortunately no longer alive in this fic.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is not sad, but has a strong melancholic tone. Ron is heavily involved, and the story ends with them winning.
