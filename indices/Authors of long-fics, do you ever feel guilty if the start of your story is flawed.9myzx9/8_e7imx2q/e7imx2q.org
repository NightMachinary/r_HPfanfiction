I think the first couple of chapters of my most followed story are trash, so yeah. I just accept that I wasn't as good as I am now and move on. In a way, I kind of separate past me and present me. So whenever someone criticizes those older parts, I kind of mentally tell past me what a fuck up she is.

Except not so harshly.
