You know whats great about publishing a fanfiction on a platform on the internet?

You can edit content at any given time. - Find a spelling error? Fix it. - Dislike the phrasing? Fix it!

I do not feel bad about the fact that the early chapters of my fanfiction(s) cannot compare to later chapters.\\
Why? Because I do not release the fanfiction until I am satisfied with the quality.
