I agree with you. I am mainly shitty at time management, so I wouldn't start publishing until I'm done to a satisfying conclusion (if not the end). I don't have time to write every day, so doing quality work takes months even. And as I don't like to read "in progress" stories that update every 2 years, I try to not do the same.

Does it take absolutely forever to finish a story this way? Yes.

But is it also consistent? Yes.

Also, if I discover a plothole later on, I can correct the story without confusing the reader.
