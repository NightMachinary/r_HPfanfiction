  Do you ever feel bad or guilty that your style or content quality improves later on in the story?

Without exception. I have gotten much better at writing and therefore my early works are/were substandard, even if not a lot of time (6 months) had passed. About half a year ago, I reread my first story "Drool" and the writing sucked. I had no issues with the plot itself, but there were way too many dialouge tags and spelling errors. Fixed that before publishing the sequel/chapter 2.

  How do you all cope with knowing something you've made is flawed at the start?

After that, I took a look at my longer stories. Again the issues were not with the plot. I am satisfied with it and there were no obvious holes, at least none that I or any reviewer could find (a few of the "plot holes" reviewers mentioned came from their fanon/headcanon assumptions and I dismissed them as irrelevant).

But the first few chapters had issues with too much exposition and quite a lot of that was unnecessary to boot. Consequently, I have rewritten chapters 1 and 2 of /No Longer Alone/ and am in the process of reworking the first chapter of /Dawn of Darkness/. There are no big changes to what happens since I don't see the need for retconning anything (so far). Most of it is just a presentation, something which is important in the first few chapters since they are often used by people to gauge the story as a whole. Especially /Dawn of Darkness/ has issues there since the first two chapters were taken from a one-shot and then turned into a bigger story. Consequently, the first chapter which truly reflects the whole thing is Chapter 3, a disparity I am trying to take care of.
