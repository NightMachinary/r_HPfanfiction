Abso-fucking-lutely.

I'm happy with the direction my story has taken, but looking back at those first ten chapters? God, it's the absolute worst.

But, at the same time, if I could go back in time and tell myself that "powerwank fics aren't as popular as you think they are," I wouldn't take the opportunity. Looking back at my story and noting the difference in quality between the beginning and now is a fantastic way for me to measure how much I've improved since then.

I think it's best to remind yourself that it's /fanfiction./ Yeah, some people can get really, /really/ serious about it, but they're far and few between. Have fun with your writing! There's no shame in keeping up something old and silly, and there's also no shame in changing it. It's all up to you.
