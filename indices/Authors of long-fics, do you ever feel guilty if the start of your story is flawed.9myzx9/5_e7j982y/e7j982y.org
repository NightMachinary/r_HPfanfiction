Yes. I'm frankly astonished anyone made it through my first fanfic at all, the first half was quite terrible.

But I hardly have time to write onward, much less go back and edit. I would love to have a stronger beginning, but at the moment I'm more concerned with finishing. I tried pausing to edit, and it basically resulted in a six-month nothing happening wherein all I managed to rewrite was the prologue. Not worth it. Better to just keep moving forward.

Fanfic is nice because people are much more forgiving of less than incredible writing, willing to give stories more of a chance than regular books.
