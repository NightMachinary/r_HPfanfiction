This is the two sock problem, but with fanfiction!

When Knitters finish their first sock, the bottom half is much better than the first half, so they're conflicted; should I start a new sock (and have one nice sock and one ugly sock), or tear apart the old one and start over?

I'll tell ya, there's a reason that most socks are made by machines now!
