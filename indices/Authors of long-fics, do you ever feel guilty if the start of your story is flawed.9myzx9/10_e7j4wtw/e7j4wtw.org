Dear lord, yes. So much so. My co-written series is at 439k without the side stories and if I go back and read the first few chapters, they feel very surface level in comparison to everything else. It only hits stride around Chapter 8 (though is comparatively better around 4) out of a total of 47 and I do cringe a lot if I read before those eight. Some stuff I'm really pleased with, but in terms of my own writing in that period, it was obvious I hadn't written fic in several years at that point. I just hope people like it enough to push through.
