Thanks! I'm committed to keeping [[/spoiler][Future Hermione]] a background character at most, to subvert the [[/spoiler][do-over]] trope and maintain focus on realistically-smart!Hermione. But that plot does help in giving my Hermione a bit more of a challenge than the canon plot on its own might have. ;)
