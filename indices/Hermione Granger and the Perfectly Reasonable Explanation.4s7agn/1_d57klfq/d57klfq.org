I have really been enjoying it so far and am always looking forward for the next update! I find your HGPRE!Hermione much more likable and realistic than HPMOR!HJPEV. You went into a somewhat dangerous path with this kind of scenario but, so far, you have avoided all usual pitfalls (mostly, overpowering the character). My only gripe was as a non-native English speaker, with the riddle to Ravenclaw tower from chapter 7; however, this is very specific.

Anyway, great job with this, and I look forward to reading more!
