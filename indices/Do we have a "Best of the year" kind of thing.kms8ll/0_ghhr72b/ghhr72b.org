I mean, it probably wouldn't be that hard to do but the mods would have to be on board. [[/r/Fanfiction][r/Fanfiction]] does it very well, but only focuses on genre-based categories. I'd love to see "best new author" and maybe "best dialogue" or "best plot" or something.

[[/r/Fanfiction][r/Fanfiction]] also focuses on works that are new as of 2020, which helps narrow things down.
