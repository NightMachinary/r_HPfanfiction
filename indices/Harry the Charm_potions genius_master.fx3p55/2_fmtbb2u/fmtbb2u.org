I know right! There are some authors which write the most amazing fics with detailed descriptions of potion theory etc. Those stories are always a treat to find! Unfortunately I've got a really really poor following system and I've read so so much that I can't really find anything anymore so... yeah this is all i've got.

Genius!Draco where he's very good at ancient ruins. The characterisation and the plot is fantastic! It's also a four part series which was amazing to read. I really recommend this one!

Genius!Harry with wbwl trope. It's interesting to read as Harry does a bit of alchemy and potions is quite important with Snape being a pseudo father figure. I recall him designing a broom as well and the author writing about the ruins that went into that. (Can also be found on ao3) /\/This was really really good**

Don't get put off by the summary! It was actually a very well written idea. The OC does ruins and designs quite a few things using it.

This one is a Dark!Harry fic and Genius!Harry. It doesn't really fit what you're looking for but it does have the genius tag :P
