Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) as well as linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) delve heavily into potions theory - in Problem of Potions, Harry is passionate about Potions but not necessarily an innate genius (a Genius of Hard Work, so to speak), while she (fem!Harry) is definitely a prodigy in the Pureblood Pretense.
