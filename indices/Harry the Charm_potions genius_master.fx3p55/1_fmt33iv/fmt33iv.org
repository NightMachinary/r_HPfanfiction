One of my favorite fics is a Severus/Harry fic (romance develops lateeeeer) but Harry becomes a potion master. It even explains potion making and stuff. Idk if you would become discouraged cuz of the pairing though. Its a twin-fic... [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3780602/1/][invisible]]

Highly recommend it though.
