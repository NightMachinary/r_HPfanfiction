Seconded this. Perhaps the first question to ask in this context is if there's any feature you want to put narrative focus on (eg eye, hair or skin colour) because you have plans to use that (eg a running gag about Harry having the prettier shade of green eyes). Then think about what else makes the character stand out (eg a Punk style for Tonks). Lastly, fill the blanks of what else you need to describe a character.
