Angelina's eyes are likely quite dark. Not that all black people have dark eyes, but law of averages and all.

Katie Bell I see clearly as light brown hair and light brown eyes. I think the movies go along with this as well.

Poor Alicia is basically just a name in canon. So, super quick, without overthinking, what do YOU see when you picture Angelina, Katie, and Alicia laughing together as they climb onto their brooms? That's what Alicia should look like in your fic.
