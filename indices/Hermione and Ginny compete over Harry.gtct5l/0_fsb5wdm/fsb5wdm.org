I'd read a story like this. Way too much of fanfiction either makes the 'loser' in romantic competition cartoonishly evil, or just ignores all possessive instincts human have and push a harem, which is nice wish fulfillment but completely absurd in reality.

There are probably very few people that *haven't* experienced jealousy over someone they are romantically interested in their real lives, yet it is one of the least realistically portrayed emotions in fanfiction. Weird.
