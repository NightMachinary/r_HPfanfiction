The purpose I originally intended for Daily Fics is to introduce readers to fics that I or the community think are good. I think Daily Fics will also function well as an archive of sorts. I also wanted there to be discussion of the fic in the comments.

I wanted there to be reviews of the fanfic from other people in the Original Post but I didn't have time to reach out. If anyone wants me to PM them asking for reviews, be sure to reach out.

I agree with your assessment of Make A Wish as well. Forrest Gump was much better. There weren't many characters, and none of them were well developed. I did use a /5 rating system for the overall rating.
