You are assuming that redemption depends on the gravity of the transgression but there are people that believe that everything is redeemable.

"Everything that can be understood can be forgiven."

If you think like that there's no such a thing as unredeemable, so this is a question about personal beliefs. If you assume that redemption is just for some people that weren't /that bad/ it really depends on where you draw your line about wrong doings. Being a bully? Murder? Bigotry? And which rule are you using to measure? law? divine law? your own?

Or are you asking if it can be done in fics? Definitely. It's fiction /everything/ can be accomplish with enough writing skills and convincing prose. In the books his redemption was a bit up in the air, but I also think it has a lot to do with the generational gap that new readers have with the original work and JKR.
