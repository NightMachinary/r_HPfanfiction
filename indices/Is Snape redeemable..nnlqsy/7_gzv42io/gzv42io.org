Depends of what you mean by "redeemable".

Snape is an asshole, a petty man who took pleasure into tormenting his students and who probably only kept his job because Dumbledore /really/ needed him close for reasons unrelated to his talent in potions. He is clearly a "bad" man who the start to the end. Though whenever he is worse than the Dursley is up to debate since, while both assholes, they are of a different kind.

But at the same time, Snape played his role perfectly. While he hated Harry from the start, he did everything in his power to protect his life. On Dumbledore's orders, he came back in the rank of the Death Eaters, managing to fool Voldemort in the process, and managed to become one of Voldemort's "most trusted". In DH, he even use his position as a Headmaster to "limit" the damages made by the Carrows, at least until the Trio escape from Malfoy's Manor. An example of that is the "detention" he gave the Neville, Ginny and Luna after they tried to steal Gryffindor's sword in his office. He knew very well that a night in the forest with Hagrid is barely a punishment, especially when compared to whatever they Carrows would have done (with the Cruciatus probably involved).

So, if you only judge Snape character, he is probably irredeemable. Losing his Blood Purist views was probably the maximum he could do in term of improvement, and he was still a petty, bitter man that should probably not have been in charge of children. But if you judge his actions, Snape was a key actor of the war (I don't think anyone outside of Harry, Voldemort and Dumbledore played a bigger role), who took every risk possible for his side to win. Even at the very end, when being bitten by Nagini, his last moments were not spend trying to save his life, but making sure Harry gets the last information he needs to play his own role. And with it, I think he redeemed himself.
