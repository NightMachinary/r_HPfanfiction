Another important point is that, while Snape is indubitably on the right side, his motivations are just terrible :

- Snape didn't betray Voldemort because he stopped believing in blood purity or didn't want to kill a child, he changed side for Lily.
- He didn't protect Harry because protecting a child was his responsability, or even because he truly believed that Harry was important for the war, he did it because Harry was Lily's son.
- And in the end, he wasn't opposed to Harry having to sacrifice himself because he liked the boy, he was opposed because of Lily.

Even if his character did have some development in the story (the fact he asked Phineas Black to not use the word "Mudblood" even when they were alone show that he became at least opposed to Blood Purity), pretty much everything Snape did was motivated by his feelings for Lily. Which may seem kinda weak when compared to the others "/Stopping a genocide may be the right thing to do?/", not to mention it raises the question about whenever Snape would have been nearly as usefull if Neville had happened to be the BWL.

That's the reason why I think Snape's life may be summarised by "/A bad man, who did the right thing, for the wrong reason/".

Also, while totally accidental, Snape's actions may have saved the Ministry. From what we learn from Canon, the Ministry was barely holding up even after starting the use the Unforgiveables when Voldemort vanished. Which means that without the Prophecy, Harry may have had a better childhood (hard to be worse than the Dursley), but it would have sucked for pretty much everyone else.
