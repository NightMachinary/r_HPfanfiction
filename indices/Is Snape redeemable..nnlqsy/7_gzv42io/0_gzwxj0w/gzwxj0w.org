Snape is very much like a tragic hero and his heroic deeds and acts are negated by the fact if he didn't tell about the prophecy then Lily and James don't die on halloween that day and the longbottoms aren't tortured so early

I'm not saying they live for ever and ever blah blah blah but they could raise their children and the prophecy may not com to fruition as they wouldn't be marked
