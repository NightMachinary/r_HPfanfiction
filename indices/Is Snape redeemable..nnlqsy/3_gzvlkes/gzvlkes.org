Depends from who's perspective you're looking. He's shitty to students that are outside his house but he is respected by the Slytherins. He also seems to be quite, at least, appreciated within the staff, within the Order and by the Death Eaters. Harry hates him and he hates Harry and the Gryffindors. As for being worse than the Dursleys I don't know, but I know that his detentions involve doing mundane tasks without magic and not sending a bunch of kids at night in the Forbidden Forest while a unicorn killer is on the loose such as some other more beloved teachers do.
