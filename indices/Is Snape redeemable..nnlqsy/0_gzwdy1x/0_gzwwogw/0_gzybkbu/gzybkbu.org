Yeah, I know, and to this day I haven't forgiven some of my teachers for being absolute utter shits of human beings, but still, in the big scheme of things, there really is a lot worse things one can be. There are also many people out there who are super nice to kids whom I would rank below Snape, for being cowardly little goody two shoes who talk big about good and evil but would run a mile rather than fight. Whatever the motives, Snape did put his life on the line.
