Dumbledore was also a blood supremacist for a cool few years before it had consequences to a person he cared about. He was probably projecting.

And there were plenty of awful teachers and unsuitable punishments for children in that school. If you take into account Dumbledore was the headmasters ALL those actions are ultimately his responsibility and yet he is a much more redeemable character?
