That's not my point though.

The question is, why is "bullying his (non-Slytherin) students" and "being a blood supremacist" /wrong/. In other words, what is your (or the hypothetical, if you're asking about possibilities) moral framework you operate in.

It's not usually an issue; usually, you'd agree by and large most people adhere to a certain standard, and by that standard something is unforgivably wrong or it isn't, but that doesn't help you here, if you want to know if it all /can/ be forgiven. In particular, to take the most extreme stance, Lucius Malfoy would not think those two things needed to be forgiven, since they weren't wrong in the first place.
