Sure, if you're willing to change his actions in a story you can redeem him, but one of the things about canon Snape is that he chooses not to move on from the heartbreaks in his life and he wallows in bitterness and contempt for himself and literally everyone else on the planet.

I feel like a defining thing about his character is that at any point he could actually choose not to be a complete and utter cunt, but he makes that choice.

There are environmental and social factors outside of his control but the sheer enthusiasm with which he embraces being a bitter and caustic human is definitely a choice. And not just one but a continual choosing of the low road.

So in short, yes, I do believe he's redeemable but I also think he chooses not to actually go after true redemption.
