Snape was a high rank D.E. How many innocent did he raped, tortured and killed to reach this position?

He only changed sides because his boss killed his sexual obsession. If Voldemort had decided to go after Neville, Snape would have remained a happy murderer until the end. ...

And seriously. What was Snape plan with Lily? Voldemort would kill James and Harry... and then? What would do Snape with a destroyed woman? To make her his sexual slave? To brainwash her? Obliate and imperiuse her?... Because he couldn't think she would want anything to do with the murderers of her loving husband and son...

Luckily for Lily, Snape plan didn't work. ..

So no redemption. Snape was a monster who fought on the right side of the war just to get revenge.
