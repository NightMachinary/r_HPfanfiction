I used to be a huge Snape fan( as you can see from my username) but I got an teacher who was exactly like Snape, I mean he used to bully one of the best students in our class and preferred his neighbour's daughter who was a good student but not that much and extremely snooty.I used to take note of the interaction and saw that it really doesn't matter if your bully of a teacher had a crush on your mother. Snape hated Harry just for looking like James(does that mean he wouldn't have if he looked like Lily?) and compared him to his "dead" father who died protecting his family, whom Harry idolized and asked him questions on his first day at class! My parents are teacher, believe me, and I know that you just not ask questions on the first day of class. And that excuse about his being in good books of Voldemort, Voldemort himself was in the school that year!He didn't instruct Quirell to do so! And Crouch? And if you are fixated on the same woman even after 15 years, that's obsession, not love. And that werewolf incident, if Hermione in third year can figure out he is one, I bet plenty of older years and atleast some Ravenclaws would have figure it out, and his housemates? Werewolves can't touch silver, they must have noticed during potions. Did they report Remus?No! But Snape had to follow them to expel them. Yes Sirius was a immature boy, I can agree with that, but still. James being a bully? We don't have any point of view other than Snape's and we don't know what Snape had done to James and his friends! Lily is seen informing Snape about how her friends do not like their friendship, surely she would have told them about their previous friendship? And Snape's friends just plainly did some " cruel" things to Lily's friends, but he just evaded it by saying that James has a crush on her! And him being a spy and risking his life? Voldemort thought that Snape was his spy in Dumbledore's Order and Snape does give him some correct informations, or else Voldemort wouldn't have trusted him regarding the flight of seven harrys. Sorry if I went into rant, but forever grudge holding people are very hard to be redeemed...
