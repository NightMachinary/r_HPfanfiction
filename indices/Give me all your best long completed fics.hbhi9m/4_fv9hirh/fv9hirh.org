I'm a big fan of Linkao3(Falling Through Time) it's over 353k but doesn't feel that way at all. It's an accidental time traveling story with a shorter “jump” than most stories and just completed at the end of February.

Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce) is also complete and more than 356k - this one started out with a pretty cracky premise but ended up completely blowing me away with the writing and ability to make me care about characters I never gave much though to before. It's a little odd in that Gordon Ramsey is a “character” and I make it a rule to not read “real people” fic but this is so out there that it's basically an OC with a familiar name.
