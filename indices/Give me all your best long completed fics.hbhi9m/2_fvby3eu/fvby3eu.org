linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13586585/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Enigmatic-Professor-Riddle]]) is a fic I'm still writing, but the update speed is fast and that should most likely work for you.

It is an AU where basically Tom Marvolo Riddle didn't become Lord Voldemort after school, and chose a slightly different approach - with the end result that when he applied for the post of the DADA Professor, Dumbledore was happy to accept him.

Now Dumbledore is dead, Minerva is Headmistress, Tom is Deputy Headmaster and Harry is beginning his first year at Hogwarts.

Do let me know how you find it!
