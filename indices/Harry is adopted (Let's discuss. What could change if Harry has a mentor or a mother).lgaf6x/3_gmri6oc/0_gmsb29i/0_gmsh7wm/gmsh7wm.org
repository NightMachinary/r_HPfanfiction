Sirius is intelligent, but he's 22, or nearly so, it would be a little ridiculous for him to work a 90 something year old politician, especially one as powerful. Scrimgeour and Fudge tell us Dumbledore kept them from Harry post OotP and /they/ were Ministers.

I also think you're giving his relationship with and knowledge of Dumbledore a little too much. He knows of him as any former student knows their Headmaster, but he doesn't work closely with Dumbledore or know him in the same way Harry, and Snape to any extent, do.
