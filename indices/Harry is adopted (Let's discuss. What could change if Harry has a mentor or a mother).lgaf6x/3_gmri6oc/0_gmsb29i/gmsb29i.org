I would argue it's somewhat believable for black to outmaneuver dumbledore. He's known him practically his whole life, and has worked together closely with him in the order. And while /most/ fics have sirius as care free and irresponsible, black is still deffinetly an intelligent character and if a writer chose to make him more serious and competent following the events of james and lilys death, it really wouldn't be a stretch to see him out maneuver dumbledore in regards to harry.

For example, the harry black series did this quite well
