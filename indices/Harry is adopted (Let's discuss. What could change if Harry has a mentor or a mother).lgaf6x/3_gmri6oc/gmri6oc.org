I enjoy mentor stories, too, but I tend to stay away from adoption stories. Harry never acts his age and there's a lot of spanking, especially in Severitus.

I think what bothers me the most is how easily Dumbledore is outmaneuvered. I dislike the trope and the bashing, but Dumbledore very much controls who Harry meets. It's so unrealistic to me that a set of muggles or a Black can just grab him. Incidentally, my favorite adopted Harry fic is Resonance by greengecko. Snape has Dumbledore's permission, Dumbledore also dies, and Harry acts his age.

The Malfoys loving Harry like a son while also keeping their canon ideals is an unexplored area I've tried toyed with.
