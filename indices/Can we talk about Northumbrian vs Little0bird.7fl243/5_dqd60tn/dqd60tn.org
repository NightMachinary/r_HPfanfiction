I think a lot of it comes from popularity bias. Their stuff gets recommended loads and loads. It's some of the first fics that get recommended to new and new-ish readers. So that creates an imbalance between how often the story gets read verse how good they actually are. I don't really like the writing style (or subject matter) of most of their fics, but I could see why some people would. It's just not for me.
