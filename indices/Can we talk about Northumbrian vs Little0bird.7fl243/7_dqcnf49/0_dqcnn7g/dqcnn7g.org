I think Little0bird's popular for "The First Day" which picks off right after the Battle of Hogwarts. She then continued the story all the way up to when most of the kids attended Hogwarts, sadly the last one remains unfinished at 103 chapters but in my opinion it's a fascinating read. It's not particularly action packed and mainly deals with the day to day of the characters and she does cover quite a number of them.

I have no idea which ones are Northumbrian's popular fics, I just started from the beginning but lost interest after maybe the 7th one chaptered piece.
