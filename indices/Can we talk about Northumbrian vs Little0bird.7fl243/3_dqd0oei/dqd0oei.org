I glossed over Northumbrian's works focusing on what happened right after the Battle of Hogwarts and went straight to the ones where Harry was already somewhere high up in the Auror chain of command. I liked the world building there, on how Harry revolutionized the Auror corps for example by making unconventional choices like hiring a werewolf, a vampire and a Muggle, and how the mirror phone was developed.
