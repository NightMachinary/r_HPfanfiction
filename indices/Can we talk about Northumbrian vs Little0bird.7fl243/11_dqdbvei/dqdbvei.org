Well, I don't actually agree with you - I don't have problems with the characterization as such - but rather, I find Northumbrian's stories stupefyingly boring. I read like 10 chapters and realized I couldn't be bothered to actually give a shit about any of these characters.

Also, really, a muggle housewife as a protagonist? I think he was going for creating the blandest protagonist possible, to contrast with the Awesome!Potters, but reading about some random bint doing housework annoyed me to the extreme.
