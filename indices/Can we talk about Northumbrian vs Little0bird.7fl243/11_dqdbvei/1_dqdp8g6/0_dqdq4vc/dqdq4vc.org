  sounds pretty offensive
#+end_quote

It's meant to be offensive - I didn't enjoy the character at all.

#+begin_quote
  stupefyingly boring
#+end_quote

That refers to the story as a whole, not just the protagonist.

#+begin_quote
  blandest
#+end_quote

Well she is the blandest isn't she?

#+begin_quote
  disbelief that people could find a muggle housewife interesting
#+end_quote

My disbelief centers on the author choosing to use such a protagonist, rather than people finding her interesting.

#+begin_quote
  it comes off as sexist as well
#+end_quote

Ah, I don't get why you feel that way, it certainly wasn't my intention. I assure you, I would find it equally tedious to read about a househusband. My annoyance centered much more on the muggle part.
