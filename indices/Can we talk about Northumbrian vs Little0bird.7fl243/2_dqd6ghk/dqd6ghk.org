I don't recall some of the dumb ditz stuff about Ginny, nor her acting like she wanted to jump his bones right after the battle, but I might just not be remembering it right. Ginny as a drunk was a plot line in that story relating to her being poisoned. The whole point of the story was that she was being made to not act like herself, so I don't think you can fault Northumbrian for her characterization there.

The ironic thing with little0bird and Northumbrian is that Northumbrian incorporates a lot of the Muggle world into his stories, yet little0bird's stories, while fully in the wizarding world, felt a lot more like a typical muggle life where magic didn't really play much of a role.

Northumbrian is better for plot-heavy stories, while little0bird is good for slice of life, "this is how their lives probably would play out absent a Voldemort villain." Not always interesting but still a good story and it makes the characters feel real.
