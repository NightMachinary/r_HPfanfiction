The best Northumbrian stories (Strangers, James and Me) are better than Little0bird's best (Questions and Answers). But I feel Little0bird's average fic is better than Northumbrian's average. A lot of Northumbrian's works, esp. his early ones (Grave Days, Aurors and Schoolgirls, and a few others) I couldn't bring myself to finish, while Little0bird's Dudley and McGonagall and Teddy fics are all good without being exceptional.

I think I prefer Northumbrian just a bit (peak is more important to me than average). [[/u/floreatcastellum][u/floreatcastellum]] beats them both in quality, though she hasn't written as much.
