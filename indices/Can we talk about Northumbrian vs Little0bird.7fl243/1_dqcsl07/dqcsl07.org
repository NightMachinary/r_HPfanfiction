Yeah his characterisation of Ginny is why I can't really enjoy Northumbrian. There's also weird manufactured drama about Ginny wearing revealing clothes around other men in one of his fics, I think, which made me roll my eyes so hard they nearly came out the back of my head.

That said, the sheer scale and consistency of his writing is really something to admire, not to mention the technical quality. Strangers is not my cup of tea but is very creative and deserving of it's rep.
