Even during Grave Days, which follows just after the war; Ginny is portrayed in (to me) a very uncharacteristic way. She's hormonal, constantly PDAs, and behaves in a rather flighty manner. It's not just that it's unlike Ginny, it's so strange because it's just after the war and she has lost so much (friends and family).
