Haven't read any of Little0bird's fics, so I can't really say anything about them... but I have read a lot of Northumbrian, and I think I can say this: He's better with original characters than he is with the canon ones, and he writes the Muggle world better than he writes the wizarding one.

Strangers at Drakeshaugh is -- at least in my opinion -- his best fic, and that story takes place in the Muggle world and the main character is a Muggle housewife who becomes the neighbour of Harry, Ginny and the kids (with her own kids becoming friends with the Potter kids). I love this story, and much of the fun of it is to see the familiar wizarding things and characters through the eyes of someone who isn't in on the secret, as she gets closer to figuring it out.

The only other Northumbrian fic that is anywhere near as interesting is "James and Me," which ALSO takes place in the Muggle world and stars a Muggle OC who doesn't know about the wizarding world (in fact, she's the daughter of the main character from "Strangers").

I tend to lose interest pretty quickly when Northumbrian tries to center on the wizarding world and star the canon characters, I'm always "noooo, I want more Muggle OCs!" I think he'd make a pretty good urban fantasy writer... I think he's better with his own characters than with other people's characters.
