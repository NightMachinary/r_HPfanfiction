As /y/Slytherinrabbit said, in perhaps one of the few examples of sexism in the Wizarding World (though it's no doubt an artifact of the 11th century standards of the Founders and little more). Boys can't get into girls' dormitories, but not vice-versa. Indeed, Hermione comes to visit plenty of times.

As for when Ginny found it empty, my first guess would be during a Quidditch match, off the cuff, but maybe I'm forgetting some reason or other why that couldn't work in the book.
