I'm going to guess here and say it was probably two things.

One, he may have been getting tired of the setting, and wanted to write powerwank and sex scenes in a different setting. I gather from the author notes he's going to move his version of harry to westeros for a game of thrones crossover.

Two, he was probably getting flamed a lot and was getting tired of explaining his position. Even the last chapter has a bit about how islam is bad.
