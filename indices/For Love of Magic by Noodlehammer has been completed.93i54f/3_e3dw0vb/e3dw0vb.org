I have a feeling the author rushed the ending, it felt a little... forced. I get that an endless fic (some fics are 200+ chapters long, end it already!) is also bad, but that's the beauty of fanfiction, you're not forced to stick to an arbitrary word limit.

I dunno, I felt the story had a lot more to offer.
