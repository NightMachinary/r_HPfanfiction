The last couple of chapters seem to contradict the underlying themes of the work, which I believe are rather utopian. All throughout the book, Harry has forced himself to improve, to find a solution.

The notion that he fails in the end, I think, speaks more about the author's current mindset about the world then what the story was actually building to.

It's pretty clear that he's just done with the whole thing and instead of taking a break and coming back to it when he felt reinvigorated, we are left with a rushed, anticlimactic ending that doesn't suit the 800,000 words that preceded it.
