Personally I had a lot of fun,

While I accept that the writing was not worth a Nobel, it was solid which can only be said about less than 1% of fanfiction.

Also it has the, in my opinion, most believable portrayal of a multi partner relationship.

I liked the exploration of the mechanics of magic that were sorely lacking in the source material AND I liked that is not another canon rehash.

Also I really don't get why so many people critique the sex, I don't really think it takes anything away from the fic, in fact Noodlehammer is one of the authors I feel integrate sex into his fics without it feeling awkward or out of place
