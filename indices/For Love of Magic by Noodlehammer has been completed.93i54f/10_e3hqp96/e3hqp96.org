I enjoyed the world building and the characters quite a bit. Could have done without the constant porn, but hey, that's just me, and it certainly didn't ruin the story for me. Overall a 9/10 in my opinion, however due to the length I likely won't reread it for a while, as it would suck up an entire day.
