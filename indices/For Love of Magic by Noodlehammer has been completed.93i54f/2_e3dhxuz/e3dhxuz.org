Island building was pretty solid, I'm a sucker for that sort of thing. As to the sex scenes? I came in expecting them, didn't bother me. As to Harry's character? Not my favorite but bearable. The writing? Better than the usual Harry Crow fic, but nothing remarkable. All in all a readable fic with unique elements. It was 'average' nothing more nothing less. All in all a decent read but something I probably won't ever go back and reread or mention unless it is specifically asked for in a thread.

I'm just glad that HP fanfic is still being completed, after being in the fandom so long it is just nice to have an author complete a work.
