Unfortunately the idea that this is normal for some women to bleed after their first time is the problem. It is such a widely spread misbelief that I almost don't fault people for believing it from the off.

It comes from the mistaken belief that the hymen is some barrier that must be 'broken' during intercourse. It is this same belief that allows nonsense like tests of a woman's virginity to still take place. The whole thing is medieval.

The bleeding is sadly a result of lack of adequate preparation or foreplay and the skin within the vaginal canal being torn.

Sorry if this sounds like i'm ranting at you, I'm not, this is just my biggest bugbear with how we teach sex ed.
