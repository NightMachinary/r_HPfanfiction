It's just misinformation. But yes some women do bleed after their first time, no matter how well prepared they are.

My first time with my current girlfriend (virgin at the time) we were ultra-prepared and careful. Lots of foreplay, lubricant, took it very slowly, etc.

She still had a small amount of blood afterward. It's perfectly normal to bleed, or not bleed for your first time. But preparation will ensure that it is painless, and minimal.

While the hymen is not a barrier to be “broken” it can absolutely be torn during sex if it is still of a comparably large size.
