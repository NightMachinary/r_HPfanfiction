I like the user-submitted tags. searching for vamp!hermione and excluding BSDM (seriously, almost every vamp!hermione story I find ends up with that) for example would be useful.

As for the pandora-like idea, if I like a story I tend to look at the author's page and there are often similarly themed stories in their favourites. That is, on ffn at least.
