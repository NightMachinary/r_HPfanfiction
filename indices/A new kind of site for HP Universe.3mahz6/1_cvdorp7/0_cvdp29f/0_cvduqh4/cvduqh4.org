After going through that website quickly, it has a number of flaws: Most importantly that it doesn't give you a description of the fic directly on the page.

An annoying, but not quite as awful flaw is that I can't filter out fics from other fandoms (half of the suggestions it gave me are Naruto fics, despite the fact that I've never read one.)
