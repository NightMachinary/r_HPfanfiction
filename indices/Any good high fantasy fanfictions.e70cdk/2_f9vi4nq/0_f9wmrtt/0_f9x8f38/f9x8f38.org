I would disagree with you on this, it's the only harem fic I could ever enjoy, because the harems are a dystopian element, as opposed to the source of all of Harry's power. I wouldn't describe its themes as misogyny or misandry, because it's all just a part of the dystopian AU that the main characters are trying to fix. It's certainly not for everyone, because it's very dark, but the active dislike for the opposite gender that most characters have comes from the universe itself, not because of the author's beliefs.
