I agree. While it's full of terrible things - it's internal to the story, it's an important part of the world building and plot.

It's like hating Cloud Atlas because of what they did to Sonmi and her people. It's like hating the Hunger Games because the Capital is making teenagers compete to their deaths. And so forth... (The maze runner, the man in the high castle, the giver, etc...)

It makes no sense to hate a dystopian story because the world/government/people is/are dystopian...

You have to play with the cards you're dealt, and when the cards are awful, the players would have to act accordingly, for good and bad.
