As far as I know there's no fic like that. But I've read a good one with similar elements (next gen girl time travels, romance with older gen guy). If all you want is Harry/Rose smut, just do a search for it on ao3. My rec was well suited to the request in the other important respects.

Also, just because you're OP doesn't mean it's all about you. I've found some favorite fics rec'd on threads that aren't what OP wanted exactly.

Finally, I took the time to find that fic for you, link it, and write a description. If it wasn't helpful to you, just say nothing. Anything else is bad manners.
