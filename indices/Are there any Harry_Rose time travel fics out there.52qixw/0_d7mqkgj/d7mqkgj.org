Not what you're asking for but really similar is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5846417/1/Choices][Choices by Aebbe]]. It's a canon-compliant (but not CC) time travel where adult lily Luna goes back to 1980 for a couple days and has a brief romance with Sirius. It's not a fix-it fic because it uses canon time travel (everything already happened that will happen etc.), but some stuff is really satisfyingly "fixed" anyway.

There are also some adult (40+) Harry scenes with 20 year old Sirius that are great. All the next-gen kids in this are great, real characters too. Linkffn(5846417)
