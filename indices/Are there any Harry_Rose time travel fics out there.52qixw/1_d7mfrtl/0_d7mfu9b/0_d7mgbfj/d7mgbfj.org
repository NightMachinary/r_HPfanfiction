No time-turners, or a Harry/Rose pairing would blow the universe.

However, a Albus/Rose/Scorpius dimensional time-travel to an alternative universe 20 years in their past would be highly interesting.

It could begin with something like that:

About 1.5 years after the CC fiasco (no time turner in my head canon, but Delphi caused different troubles at Hogwarts), the new Trio got their hands on another dangerous artifact. It blew up in their face and threw them to an parallel universe 25 years in their past. They showed up in Diagon Alley exactly on the day their parents did their shopping before year 6.
