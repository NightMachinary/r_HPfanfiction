linkffn(Albus and Harry's World Trip) kind of double subverts the easily befriended goblins trope. In that particular fanfic, Goblins are more like humans than most wizards believe, and a lot of those beliefs are based on misunderstandings(Like the concept of ownership of goblin-made items is actually the result of a wizard overhearing a joke and misunderstanding it, and goblins not being above exploiting that misconception with wizards that look down on them

Also, Harry learns extra powers, but mostly because he's told to do something and /not/ told it's impossible.
