linkffn(A Dramatic Reading) is famous for actually wringing a decent fic out of the tired old "characters read the books" format.

linkffn(Dementors by Myranya) doesn't execute the setup of the old "hero is betrayed and sent to Azkaban" premise very gracefully, but what happens /once/ Hermione gets there is quite unexpected, and fascinating --- namely, the story turns into an exploration of the Dementors and their culture, considered as a fundamentally inhuman, but not necessarily evil race.

linkffn(Harry in the Vaults of Stone), though tragically unfinished, is a really fun, non-Robstian take on a Goblin-raised Harry.
