Oh, the plot's /not/ stupid and boring! As /A Dramatic Reading/ demonstrates, it can be done quite well. It's just that most of the time the execution is stupid and boring. Especially provided you educate yourself on the usual failings of these stories, I'd be quite interested to read your story, especially as that is a very unusual roster of characters to be doing the reading.
