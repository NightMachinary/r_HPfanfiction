Fair enough! Know of any of the bad ones by name, or care to summarize, so I can familiarize myself with the usual failings?

As for the roster, well, /A Little Light Reading/ uses the situation by having Snape get an unfinished copy of the first book partway through the first year, and having him have a realization of both the Dursley's abuse and what an ass and a bully he's allowed himself to become. So I rather thought that taking that, rewinding the clock to when it would most matter, and having it be used to 'scare straight' Bellatrix, Snape, and Sirius with Lupin as the straight man as it were could present some interesting options.
