Ah, I see! You're picturing the books materializing during the First War/before the First War? That's definitely novel territory as far as I know. The usual flaws are that these end up being empty /How It Should Have Ended/esque exercise where the author's OOC versions of the canon characters make easy jabs at canon. Using the books as unlikely omens of a potential /future/, and focusing the story on the material consequences thereof, already sidesteps most of these issues.
