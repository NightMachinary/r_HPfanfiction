RobSt is someone who writes a lot of fanfics that use most of the above “tired tropes”(helpful goblins, love potions, manipulative Dumbledore, etc), and is especially heavy on bashing Dumbledore and the Weasleys(he's supposed to be manipulative, but keeps on just being a bullheaded and forceful idiot).

As a result, he tends to be a divisive figure, to the point where suggesting anything he writes typically gets a negative response.
