/blinks/ I had no idea 'Characters read the books' was a tired old format. Until just now, the only one I'd encountered was /A Little Light Reading/. And here I was thinking I'd do a fic of Snape, Bellatrix, Lupin, and Sirius getting the books while at Hogwarts and their reactions. Good to know that that plot's stupid and boring now, thanks! And thanks for the recs as well!

EDIT: Oh, also, what's Robstian mean?
