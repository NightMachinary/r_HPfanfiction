linkffn(Subversion by Myricle) is really well written and puts a twist on the Slytherins and manipulative Dumbledore tropes.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) is simultaneously the best WBWL and different school fic out there. It doesn't subvert any tropes, just executes them all really well and creates some more.
