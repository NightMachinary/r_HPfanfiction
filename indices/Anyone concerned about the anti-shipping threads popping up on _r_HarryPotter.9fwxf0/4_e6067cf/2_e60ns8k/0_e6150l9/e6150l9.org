I disagree, the idea of romantic love that currently permeates society is a fairly new concept, in the grand scheme of human history.

More over, even taken to it's base truism, that ~lust~ is a quintessential component of human existence, I can still do without it. I don't need to read about a characters bowel movements, or their masturbatory habits either, and yes I classify their hormone induced bouts of lust in the same fashion. It rarely helps the story along, and in that odd occasion that it does, the build up necessary isn't worth it.
