In fanfic the only difference I've noticed between gen fic and that focusing on romance or simply including it is that gen fics don't have pages upon pages of smut or can do without mentioning sex. I don't think I missed a lot. Romance often follows friendship and friends argue, make up and fight just as lovers do. And yet those fics I've read that didn't have romance impressed mEe far more than those that had it. I even had a lot to think about after reading fics that had ordinary relationships as their main component.
