I don't like reading ship fics myself, and also prefer to read about magic, adventure and mayhem rather than romance, but I don't have a problem with such things existing and others liking them. To each there own I say.

It is annoying in fandoms where there are very few non romance fics though, but HP doesn't seem to have that problem. A lot of the most popular fics are gen.
