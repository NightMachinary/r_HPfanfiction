To take some of those a canon based step further..

#+begin_example
  ⁠Harry has the lordship of Potter, Black, Gryffindor, Peverell, Slytherin, and etc...
#+end_example

Lordships aren't a thing (pure fanon).

• ⁠Harry has gazillion Galleons in his family vaults.

Harry has only one vault.

• ⁠Molly love potioned Arthur.

Actually partial canon. Molly did brew a love potion once as a younger girl, but there's no evidence she used it, let alone on Arthur.

• ⁠Being friendly to Goblins will suddenly make them very helpful.

• ⁠Goblins can administer inheritance test, and allow Harry to break free from Dumbledore's machinations.

Goblins are bankers. Not probate attorneys, not genealogists, and are definitely rarely friendly.

Edit: Thought of one more. Life debts aren't a thing ether.
