  Oh people have told me on that sub that fanfic is actively damaging to the fandom because it confuses people.

We often have threads here about how fanons messed up people's perception of canon. Courtesy of fanfics, many think the following are true:

- Dumbledore believes in Greater Good and worships the Prophecy.
- Hermione will never break rules.
- Ron is a jealous idiot who should not be in the Trio.
- Ginny is a love potion using slut.
- Draco is just misunderstood and has a heart of gold.
- Luna is a seer.
- Snape is an attractive sex god.
- Lucius Malfoy is an attractive sex god.
- Death Eaters are good, and the Order is bad.
- Harry has the lordship of Potter, Black, Gryffindor, Peverell, Slytherin, and etc...
- Harry has gazillion Galleons in his family vaults.
- Dumbledore and Molly steal money from Harry's vaults.
- Dumbledore dumped Harry into an abusive home with the sole purpose of better manipulating and sacrificing him in the future.
- The first meeting between Harry and the Weasleys is a setup with the purpose of bringing him under their control.
- The train is not empty, and Ron is asked/paid by Dumbledore to spy on Harry.
- Molly is a crazy control freak, all her children hate her and will leave home as soon as they are 17.
- Molly love potioned Arthur.
- Being friendly to Goblins will suddenly make them very helpful.
- Goblins can administer inheritance test, and allow Harry to break free from Dumbledore's machinations.

I think it's quite understandable why canon purists utterly despise fanfics.
