Dumbledore tends to play a major role in my stories - those he's alive in, at least - though they're mostly AUs where he's a tad more ruthless and more concerned with protecting the innocent than saving the guilty. His plans tend to rely much less on luck as well, and so do those of his opponents. He's not infallible, but he's not suffering quite as much from "adults are useless" as in canon, where kids are supposed to be the heroes.
