Reviews, favourites and alerts all help on FFnet, but "popularity" is subjective. The number of alerts mean people who want to keep reading, which is the stat I pay most attention to.

Review numbers don't mean much to me - 90% of the time the reviews I reveive personally are pretty useless in terms of allowing me to improve, and given that reviews can be good, bad, or just plain stupid, their numbers aren't necessarily a good hint of popularity.

On Ao3, my concern is kudos. Generally on an average non-explicit fic for a fandom like Supernatural, I want kudos to be about 10% of the hit count for me to judge it a success. Harry Potter being a much smaller fandom on Ao3 though, I normally look at 5-7% as a success rate - dividing by the number of chapters in a work as you go, obviously.

Ao3's better judge of popularity is in their bookmarks: how many people have bookmarked a fic and publicly recced it? I look at bookmarks because they're the most obvious judge of how much people really liked it, as people are far more discerning with bookmarks than kudos.

Comments are of the same general worth as those on FFnet. I actually delete the most stupid comments because I care so little about their numbers as a statistic.

But most important of ALL to see whether my fic is popular is whether anyone recs it. If your fic is mentioned on here or on another sub, or in a forum, that's a great sign.
