I always love reading reviews but I feel like a lot of the time they're usually short platitudes like, "great chapter looking forward to the next one." Which is nice, but I much prefer the ones that ask questions or even mention what parts they liked and didn't like. I'd actually like a hate message at this point because those at least spur questions and insight into my own writing.
