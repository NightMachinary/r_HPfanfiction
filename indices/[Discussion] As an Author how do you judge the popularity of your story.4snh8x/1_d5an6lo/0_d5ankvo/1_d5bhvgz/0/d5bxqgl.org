Some authors love all reviews! It's nice when our writing inspires someone to take a few moments and type out something. To me its like leaving a kudos, favourite or like. I'm always a little sad when authors complain about short reviews... maybe it's because I get so few * that I'm excited to hear from readers.

*I participate in a lot of review games and trades for concrit so my review count is technically high, but not from people who are just reading for pleasure. I always love hearing from people just causally reading the story since they are the target audience.
