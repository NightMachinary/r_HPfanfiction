My WIP has been like that as well, I'm a slow updater and there haven't been any big cliffhangers to garner responses (except one but most people saw right through it, which I expected). I'm hoping that when I get to the big reveal of what's motivating my villain (its post Hogwarts AU so not Voldemort) that people will respond to let me know whether it's stupid or if I'm as clever as I hope I am.
