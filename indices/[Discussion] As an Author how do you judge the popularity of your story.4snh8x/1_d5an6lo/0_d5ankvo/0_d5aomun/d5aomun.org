They are super annoying, but I think they still count for something. When I uploaded my Aunt Marge fic, most of the reviews were along the lines of "OMG! So funny!!!", but the fact that they came in such an explosion of activity (my phone buzzed with emails from ff.net. all night) was a good indication that I'd done something right. Meanwhile, my WIP will never get a reaction like that, and that's OK, because it's more likely to get in depth, detailed reviews that give me insight, and I can ignore the rest of the noise.
