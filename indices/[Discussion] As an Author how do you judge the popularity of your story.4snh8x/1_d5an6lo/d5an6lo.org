I base it on review feedback, I don't like to get bogged down in numbers too much. Obviously they play a part - 40 reviews for my one shot makes it clear that story is more popular, proportionally, than my WIP which gets about 10 reviews per chapter. But I would rather focus on the content of the reviews themselves to see if I've done a good job.
