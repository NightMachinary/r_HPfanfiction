This is the thing... I have no idea.

For me at least, each chapter release inevitably attracts a few follows/favourites with the odd surge in reviews, but until very, very recently, actual feedback outside of DLP was pretty scarce.

Of course, popularity is very subjective. I remember telling someone else how stoked I was when my fic reached 100K in views. As a fellow writer and recent reader of said story, they thought it was odd that it took so long (about 2 years).

So beyond Traffic Stats, there's no cut-and-dry way to tell apart from word of mouth. People don't review for all sorts of reasons, while faves and follows require a person to log in, and I'd wager that the majority of traffic to FFN is generated by users who either don't have accounts or can't be bothered to sign in to them.

So yeah, word of mouth has to be the closest thing to a litmus test that we have. If you see someone recommend your fic somewhere else, then you can be assured that at least a small handful of people out there are enjoying something about it.

Whether that's a /My Immortal/, /HPMoR/ or /Alexandra Quick/ sort of enjoyment is another story :D
