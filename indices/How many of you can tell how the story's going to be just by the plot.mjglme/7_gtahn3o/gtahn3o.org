Tropes.

Seriously.

Fics that use the common tropes these days are nothing but shitty, cookie-cutter clones of one another not worth throwing into fertilizer pile.

Friendly goblins? Lord Kitchensink? "Manipulative" (aka mentally-defficient) Dumbledore? Weasley and Hermione bashing? "Indie" (aka Harry is an unlikable asshole we're supposed to be rooting for) Harry? Harems (aka one-handed wank material for people who are just entering puberty or have never watched a porn film in their entire life).

Just to name a few.
