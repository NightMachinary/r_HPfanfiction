Agreed.

That's why I only ever listen to one song from every genre of music. Every other song is nothing but a shitty, cookie-cutter clone of the original.

Four-chord melody? Running bass-line? Power-chord (aka stupid) guitar? Blast beats? "Jazz" (aka shitty hand wavey incorrect notes) piano? Punk/alternative (aka one handed fist pump material for teens or people who have never been to an opera in their entire life).

Just to name a few
