Do the songs have practically the same lyrics and chorus, albeit with just one or two words changed? With the vocalists practically sounding the same (for example, a mid-twenties woman from New York), no matter how technically talented they are themselves? Are the tracks produced in such a way that they constantly mirror existing tracks to the point of being obvious derivations, no matter the instrumentals used?

You can polish a turd all you want: at the end of the day, it's still a turd.
