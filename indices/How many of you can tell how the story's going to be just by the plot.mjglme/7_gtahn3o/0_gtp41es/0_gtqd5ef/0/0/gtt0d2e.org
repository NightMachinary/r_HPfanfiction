There is a massive difference between stories following plot archetypes and stories literally being clones of one another. In your examples, while they follow overarching archetypes and tropes, the blend of plots, locations, and characters are unique to each RomCom, despite following similar or the same overarching archetypes. They're actually memorable. Heck, even if Family Guy and the Simpsons follow similar formulas, they're still unique to be remembered. Now, take Peter Griffin and Homer Simpson, clone them a million times while making slight alterations to them, and then have these new derivations re-enact the same episodes constantly but with minor tweaks. Yeah. In the latter case, the tropes used in Harry Potter fanfiction make it so that fics that use these tropes are rarely memorable, unless there's something unique blended into them (amusingly enough, this logic applies to RomComs, such as Notting Hill and Bridget Jones' Diary) -- and that reinforces my view: Harry Potter tropes create forgettable and cookie-cutter fics because they all are the same or result in the same effects on the story and characters, no matter what it is. They're overused. Stale. The only things that make them stand out that people remember? Unique and non-tropey elements. I could go on FFn right now and pick out a dozen "Indie Harry" fics that are pretty much the same -- all the way down to the infamous Goblin Friend/Diagon shopping trip and 'Lord Potter-KitchenSink bullshit -- on just the first ten, twenty at max pages alone. They're all forgettable rehashes and derivations. Clones that haven't evolved but have degraded. Personally? To me, you don't need to be a good writer. You don't need to be able to write hundred thousand word behemoth chapters. If you try to do something interesting, try to do something unique, you'd have my attention. That's why I especially love author dumping grounds for concepts and ideas that rarely last a chapter or so: some of the most unique plots and ideas come from these 'folders', and almost all of them do not rely on typical cliches. Heck, I was reading one the other day where Luna was the descendant of one of the Senior Partners: the Wolf, the Ram, or the Hart, and she was looking after Harry from the law-firm's influence. It stuck in my mind because it was unique and entertaining. Since then, I've skimmed through dozens of fics that use typical Harry Potter (Indie) tropes, and I honestly can't remember much about any of them. First sign of any cliches? You've got one chance to make something unique out of them, or to completely subvert them. Otherwise, I wouldn't even blink when closing the shit-fic and moving on -- just another forgettable piece amongst other forgettable pieces. Edit: also, Reddit fucked up the formatting. What the hell?
