Yes. That's how music works. Songs in a particular genre are inherently similar to each other, in some cases even taking the same tune and expanding on it. In jazz there are songs that have been covered thousands of times, in pretty much the same way every time.

The same thing happens in every other major form of literature or art. Mystery novels often follow the same patterns ('The butler did it'). Rom-coms have the same storyline. I couldn't even tell you the difference between Twilight and Teen Wolf. That's how everything in the arts is made.

Even some of the most celebrated works in history are copies. The Aeneid is a copy of the Iliad and Odyssey, Percy Shelley, John Keats, and Lord Byron copied each other all the time (Ode to a Skylark, Ode to a Nightingale, Ozymandias), Edouard Manet's 'Lunch on the Grass' is practically a carbon copy of a section of Marcantonio's 'Judgement of Paris'.

To say that everything that is derived from previous works is inherently bad means denouncing almost every piece of modern literature or art, and also many older ones.
