Personally, I rather like the idea of respecting other people's beliefs without Influencing your own. I as a norse 'pegan' belief that I will go to Valhalla or Hel once I die, yet I would reassure someone of greek belief that they will go to Elysium if they die because that's what they belief in. In my opinion it would be a better world if we all respected each other's beliefs and don't force people to a different religion. Thus making them all religions and not mythologies
