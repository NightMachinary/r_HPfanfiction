I don't need to read fics based on popular tropes because I already read the epitomes of them and this sub and other similar places have confirmed (what I had already assumed even before) that they all go the same direction. So I am not really interested in reading the same story over and over again. I'd rather look for some less expected stuff. However I will admit that sometimes an interesting sounding plot will direct me on a path that I would prefer to forget.
