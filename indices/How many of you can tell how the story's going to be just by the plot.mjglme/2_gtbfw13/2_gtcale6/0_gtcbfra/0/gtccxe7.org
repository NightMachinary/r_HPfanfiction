Waaay off on The Pureblood Pretense. She's not in a relationship at all, but is besties with Pansy and Draco (though she has friends in all houses), hero-worships Professor Snape and has a great deal of respect for Professor Dumbledore. The basilisk is bound to its master and therefore never friendly although she does pity it for its cruel death, she doesn't even reveal her gender much less flaunt anything, and her secretive habits very much do annoy her friends. They put up with her because they know she's generous at her core, and when the chips are down, she has a habit of saving their lives.

She does become friendly with a local snake through extensive bribery, but never buys Hedwig. And she is unusually powerful, but that causes as many problems as it solves, because it brings her a lot of attention that makes it much harder to maintain her cover.

I'm not sure what you were referring to with "how would your parents feel," but Sirius is highly supportive of her sorting, redecorates the house in green and silver and buys a bunch of garden snakes, etc. Of course, he doesn't know about the identity swap and thinks it's his son Archie who's been sorted into Slytherin. But the point is, he's being a good dad.

Riddle is an interesting one. He's still got a pretty strong evil streak, but eventually turns out to have /some/ sympathetic motivations mixed in with the bigotry. He wants to make pure-bloods marry half-bloods in order to stop a looming population implosion caused by inbreeding, but he still intends to keep muggle-borns and the associated muggle culture locked out. Harry is stunned to realise that he might be both right /and/ wrong, but doesn't join him.
