WBWL fic: the twin is named Charlus, or John, or Daniel, or James Potter Jr. Of course, it would be Harry/Daphne if not a harem. Harry gets sorted in Slytherin and kicks some random seventh year prefect's or Draco's ass and then becomes the 'Lord of the House' or something. Oh, and not to forget the whole 'baby Harry does not cry in front of Voldemort while the other twin is bawling their eyes out' and the Weasley/Dumbledore bashing.
