Let's not forget the whole ‘baby BWL is described as chubby whereas Harry, despite being a baby and almost certainly also chubby, is described as leaner and has mysterious glowing green eyes' thing too. Because apparently fatshaming babies is now the thing to do.

And while it's often Harry/Daphne, if he goes over to the ‘dark side' and discovers that the Light wants to ban all powerful forms of magic and all Pagan rituals and that's what the Dark is really fighting against (not for Muggle genocide, duh) then endgame is Harry/Voldemort.
