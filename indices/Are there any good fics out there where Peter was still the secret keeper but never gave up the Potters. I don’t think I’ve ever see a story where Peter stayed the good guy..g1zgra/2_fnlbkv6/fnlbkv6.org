I remember reading some long unfinished fic (I think it was a deleted one by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/409523/padfootjr24][this guy]], but can't be sure) where Peter had the location tortured out of him, imprisoned by the bad guys, and the Peter we know is an impostor stuck due to a prototype Polyjuice variant gone wrong.
