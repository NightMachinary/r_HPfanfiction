I would like to point out that I would love to read a decent Harry/Ginny story with her OotP characterisation (and a believable pairing for Hermione, like Justin Flinch-Finchley or any other muggleborn).

  Epilogue non-compliant

That is a pretty loose term. A story where Harry builds his own harem in his first year is not compliant to the epilogue after all...

For the sake of discussion, I will assume that you mean generally DH compliant but diverge afterwards.

The obvious way would be for them to simply not get together again. War changes people, near-death experiences change people, and the whole "only Harry and Hermione against the rest of the world" part of the hunt undoubtedly left its marks as well. I'm not saying that Harry and Hermione are in love afterwards (although a certain degree of physical intimacy would be expected of two hormonal young adults walking the edge of death by magical Nazis for months). But Harry would have a boatload of psychological issues to work through before he could begin with a relationship and I don't see Ginny "let's do this very obvious ruse, you run off and save the world, I'll be here" Weasley being the one who could understand that. If you want a believable Harry/Ginny relationship, you have to rewrite HBP and DH under that aspect (same applies to Ron/Hermione).

The next way you could break them up would be that Harry is overwhelmed by the Weasley family. He doesn't just see them a few weeks each summer, he is now part of a huge (30+ people) extended family with no prior experience in that regard. It would be like having a harem. It may fulfil your deepest fantasy at first, but after a few weeks the amount of people starts to wear you down and all you want is a quiet hour to play Starlancer (or whatever other video game was around in 2000).

If you want to go into shipping wars, Harry and Hermione fell in love during the hunt and he simply has no romantic interest in Ginny anymore. So pretty much scenario 1.

Another way would be for them to not get together because Harry has no clue how to deal with a grieving Ginny. Maybe he wants to go with Hermione to Australia because he is worried that her spells might not be reversible and Ron is in no state to go with her due to the same reason.

Throw in Teddy and Andromeda if you like. Maybe Harry pays "too much" attention to the baby and his grieving grandmother for Ginny's tastes. Maybe he kinda ignores her because he is overwhelmed with the situation. Maybe Andromeda decided that seducing an 18-year-old man is the best way to deal with her grief and they end up in an unbalanced, borderline unhealthy relationship for a few weeks/month/years/decades.
