So to be clear, do you think they had sex in canon? Or that the situation could've realistically led to that if Rowling wanted to take it that way?

  She is normalcy because she was just a girlfriend with no further attachments. Anyone can fill that role, from the recently widowed Andromeda Tonks to Demelza Robins.

Clearly the fact she was his last thought shows that it was way more than that. Ginny specifically worked with Harry. Hence the contrast with Cho, who specifically did not work with him. Could Demelza have worked? Theoretically, in that we know little about her. But Ginny was the one Rowling wrote to be compatible with Harry. And Andromeda???

  If we are talking shipping wars, Hermione would fit here better because she actually was there with Harry. And she was the one who got him to open up in OotP.

She was there, except it was really Ron who was the rock of the group. When he left, it all fell the crap and Harry had no idea how to react to Hermione's crying.

Regarding OOTP, you are right that when Hermione comes during Christmas, Harry opens the door for her and that allows Ron and Ginny to also get to Harry. But it was Ginny's reminder about being possessed that actually got through to Harry and snapped him out of his funk. And later, in the library at school it's Ginny who gets Harry to feel better when she gives him hope about talking to Sirius.

I'll be honest, I'm confused on whether we are talking about canon or just hypotheticals for a fic where H/G break up, so sorry if I'm not arguing what you are arguing.
