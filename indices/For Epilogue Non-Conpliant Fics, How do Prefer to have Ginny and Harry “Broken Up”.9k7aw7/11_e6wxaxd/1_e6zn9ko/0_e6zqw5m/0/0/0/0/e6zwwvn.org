  explicitly says he sees Hermione as a sister

That doesn't mean much from someone with no experience whatsoever when it comes to family. You don't know what having siblings is like unless you actually experience it on your own. The same way you cannot imagine what being a parent is like on an emotional level without being one (something that anyone with kids will attest).

And again, I am not saying that they were in love. But if you know that the very next day may very well be your last and there is no relief in sight, it does not take much to say "fuck +it+ her!"

*** And besides, what else was Harry supposed to say?

"I bent over the girl you love and fucked her in the arse after eating her out for half an hour. Boy, I fucked her everywhere. The table, the kitchen cabinet, the shag carpet, the sofa, against seventeen trees, in two Tesco bathrooms, there was Aisle 7 at Morrisons, my bunk, your bunk, her bunk." maybe?

How about "Actually, her tits are larger than the ghost image, and she doesn't shave down there"?

Or perhaps "When she asks you about the strap-on, say yes. Girl sure knows how to find a prostate" would go down better?

  she got Harry to open the door but it was Ginny who actually got Harry to come back from his dark place

Because a relationship will work out well when you need another woman to "open the door".
