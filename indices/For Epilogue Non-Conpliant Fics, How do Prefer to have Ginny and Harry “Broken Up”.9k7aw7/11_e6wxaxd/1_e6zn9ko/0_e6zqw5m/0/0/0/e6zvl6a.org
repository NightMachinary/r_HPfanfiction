See while I respect your interpretation of things, though I disagree, I honestly don't understand how you can think they canonically did have sex, especially when Harry explicitly says he sees Hermione as a sister and while they were by themselves, Harry basically avoided her?

  And without Hermione Ginny couldn't do jack shit.

Yes, she got Harry to open the door but it was Ginny who actually got Harry to come back from his dark place. And your argument is basically H/Hr because Hermione sorta got Harry to open up (which isn't quite true but ok) but then argue against H/G despite more examples of Ginny doing the exact same thing.
