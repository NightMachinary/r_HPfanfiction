If Rowling would have written the war in a realistic fashion, they would have had sex. As it is, well, probably. They didn't make love, that's for sure, but to blow of some steam isn't too far-fetched (not immediately after Ron left, but around Christmas would be believable). Neither believed in Ron's return or victory at that point.

  But it was Ginny's reminder about being possessed that actually got through to Harry and snapped him out of his funk

And without Hermione Ginny couldn't do jack shit.

  I'm confused on whether we are talking about canon or just hypotheticals for a fic where H/G break up

I used the "Harry and Hermione had sex" as a reason why Harry and Ginny would not get together after the war again because he ended up happy with Hermione as their fling turned into something more. That is not canonical. However, canonically speaking, I find it unbelievable if nothing would have happened between Harry and Hermione.
