  If you want to go into shipping wars, Harry and Hermione fell in love during the hunt and he simply has no romantic interest in Ginny anymore. So pretty much scenario 1.

I'm not sure if the point of this thread is to argue what canonically works as a way to break them up, so forgive me if I'm arguing something you are not. But I don't think canon supports in any way the idea they even could've fallen in love during the hunt, so I'd disagree that this would be a good way to break them up and ship Harry with Hermione. Unless we are rewriting DH in the fic.

  But Harry would have a boatload of psychological issues to work through before he could begin with a relationship and I don't see Ginny "let's do this very obvious ruse, you run off and save the world, I'll be here" Weasley being the one who could understand that. If you want a believable Harry/Ginny relationship, you have to rewrite HBP and DH under that aspect (same applies to Ron/Hermione).

I agree and disagree. You're absolutely right that Harry would have issues, and realistically he may or may not be emotionally ready for any relationship. But if anyone could make it work, it'd be Ginny. I think part of the appeal with Ginny is she is exactly the type to understand Harry and what his needs would be. Ultimately, you are correct that Harry'd have some serious issues to work through, but Ginny has already shown she would wait for him, and I think she would understand what he's going through and more importantly, have the patience to help Harry deal with his shit. I think both of them realize what it feels like to think someone you love is dead, and the gift they are given having survived. Also, Ginny is normalcy for Harry, something I think he always craved. She would be an anchor for him.
