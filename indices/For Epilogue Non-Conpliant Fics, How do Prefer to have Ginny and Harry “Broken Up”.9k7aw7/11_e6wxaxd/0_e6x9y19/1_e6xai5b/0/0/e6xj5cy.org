The issue with Ron is that by the time he gets his head out of his arse, not even the Dutch can remove the water under the bridge. I can see Ron and Hermione lasting if they meet at 20, but not after their shared time at Hogwarts (as well as the mess called sixth year and Ron's fuck-ups like the Yule Ball).

I'm not saying that Harry and Hermione would end up married, but I don't see the founder of SPEW in a long time relationship with someone who grew up with magic. Hermione thinks too much like a Muggle and she does not change in that regard as far as canon goes. Hell, she'd probably dump Ron if she found out about the driving instructor, even if that'd be a tad hypocritical.

Edit: And while Hermione sometimes has the social grace of a dreadnought, she is the only one who stayed with Harry when shit hit the fan. She was his most loyal friend. This does not necessarily translate into a relationship, but she is definitely not just a mixup of the worst qualities of some of the worst people in the series.
