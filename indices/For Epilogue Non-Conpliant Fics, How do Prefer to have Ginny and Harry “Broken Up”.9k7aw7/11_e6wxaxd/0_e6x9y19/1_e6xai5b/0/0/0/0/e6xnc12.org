  I would consider Molly to be loyal, and I don't think she has their worst qualities, just some of the ones that IMO would annoy Harry - nagging, academic rather than street smart, thinks the ends justify the need to stomp all over other people's autonomy.

I think you are mixing two people up here. Molly was not academic, nor was she particularly loyal to Harry after just expressing her concerns about the Dursleys. She claims that she is worried (CoS), basically forgets him over the summer (PoA), then does nothing but send food to a starving child (GoF), lets him be alone after a traumatic event the next summer and then has the gall to be his mother figure (OotP).

And with one exception (HBP), she is always right with her concerns. Harry honestly needed a boot to the arse occasionally, and Hermione was the one to deliver.

Also, any realistic depiction of a civil war would have played out a lot differently. Hermione had no qualms about disfiguring traitors, she'd go to town on any Death Eater (Malfoy would get a Veritasserum interrogation, not be ignored).
