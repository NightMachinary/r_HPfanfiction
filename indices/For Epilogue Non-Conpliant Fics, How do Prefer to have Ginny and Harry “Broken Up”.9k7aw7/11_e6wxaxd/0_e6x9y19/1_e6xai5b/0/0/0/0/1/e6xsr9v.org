Sorry, I should have been more clear. Nagging from Molly, the third one from Albus, and the second one is just her. She also has Petunia's love of structure and competitiveness (they both like being the best and put effort into being seen as that, though Petunia is more about surface appearances). Harry spent his early life lacking autonomy, his Hogwarts years carrying a whole lot of high expectations, and I think he would enjoy having a quite life without anyone pushing him to do this or that. Or he would travel and try to 'find himself' or something. Either way, he and Hermione would not work out. Honestly, I just find Hermione annoying - I've met people like that IRL and while I'm sure they're good people, I always made sure to spend as little time as possible around them. Ron has ambition, he's just lazy. Hermione would push him to achieve his potential which would in the end make him happy I think. Having said that, all successful relationships take work and RonxHermione would need a lot of work.
