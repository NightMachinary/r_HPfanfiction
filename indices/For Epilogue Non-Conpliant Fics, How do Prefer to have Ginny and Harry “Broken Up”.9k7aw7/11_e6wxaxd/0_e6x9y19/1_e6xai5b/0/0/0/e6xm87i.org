I would consider Molly to be loyal, and I don't think she has their worst qualities, just some of the ones that IMO would annoy Harry - nagging, academic rather than street smart, thinks the ends justify the need to stomp all over other people's autonomy. But she also is loyal, studious, and organized, which are positive traits.
