Hermione does only push people if there's something amiss. If thery were just living together, Hermione an arse kicking attorney and Harry doing whatever the fuck he'd want to do after the war, I don't see her bad qualities coming out as much as at Hogwarts. And given that Harry seems to be domestically adept (eg he can cook better than her) and cleaning with magic takes a few seconds, I don't see much conflict.

I'm not saying that they are destined for each other, but out of all the canin characters, they have the best chemistry. But given how life works out, Harry might end up with Demelza Robins ten years down the road.
