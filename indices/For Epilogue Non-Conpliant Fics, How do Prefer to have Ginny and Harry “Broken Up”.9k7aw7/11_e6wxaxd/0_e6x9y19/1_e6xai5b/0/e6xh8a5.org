The thing is Ron is one of the few characters that actually develops and matures during the series, and those changes would help that relationship last. Having said that, I don't mind if they break up, I just think RonxHermione makes more sense than Harmony - Hermione is like a mix of Molly, Petunia, and Dumbles (erasing her parents' memories for their own good is what made me start to dislike her). Ron would throw hissy fits if she starts getting on her high horse and would fight her off, but Harry would bottle things up until he'd blow up and end the relationship and any chance of them staying friends. Obviously this is my own interpretation of their characters.
