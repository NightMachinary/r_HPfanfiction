I don't really care as long as it's not some overly dramatic breakup such as the "Ginny has been giving Harry love potions the whole time" or "Ginny cheated on Harry" or Ginny is really only a boy who lived fangirl and never really loved Harry" route. Sometimes couples just don't work out, and there doesn't have to be drama. There are too many fics where pairings break up in a dramatic fashion and it leads to bashing.
