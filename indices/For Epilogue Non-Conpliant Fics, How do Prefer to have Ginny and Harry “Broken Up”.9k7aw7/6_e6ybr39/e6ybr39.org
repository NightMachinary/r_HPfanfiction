While I'm a big H/G shipper and believe they are absolutely compatible on a physical, emotional and mental level, I would say the most realistic way to break them up is death, followed by incompatibility with life goals. Maybe Harry wants a family but Ginny just isn't there, at least not for the foreseeable future. Otherwise, the next best way is Harry simply fails to prioritize Ginny over his career or Ron and Hermione, or whatever. Harry doesn't have a lot of experience as a good boyfriend, he tends to be self-centered, and he has been known to not take Ginny's desires into account enough.
