Agreed.

They just break up. There's no need to make it some kind of earth shattering event - unless you're already deeply invested in the Rowling fantasy that they are some kind of perfect couple that are destined to be together.

Making a big deal out of it (same goes for Ron/Hermione, where it's even more ridiculous) tells me a lot about the author. Harry having to go through some kind of mental anguish and deeply personal journey of self-discovery because of his 2 month relationship with a dot on a map is kinda laughable.
