My favorite part of reading is when the reading makes me feel for the characters. Taliesin19 does a wonderful job of letting me feel Harry's grief during chapter 18. It isn't just that he himself is sad, but the fact that he has to guide and parent is children through the loss of their mother. I'd hardly call the traumatic loss of a spouse moping.

Some of the most popular romances out there have heavy doses of sadness in them. Romeo and Juliet. The Notebook. Gone With the Wind
