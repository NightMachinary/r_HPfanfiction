Yes, killing Ginny (and even Ron) off would avoid any bashing, preserve their canon characterizations, and not turn Harry (and Hermione) into cheaters.

Another option is to simply have Harry and Ginny separating on amicable terms because both of them have changed too much, for example in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11858167;11697407).
