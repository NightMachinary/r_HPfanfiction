It's really hard for Harry and Ginny to be Oedipal when Harry doesn't know enough about his mother to know if she's anything like Ginny. The only thing Harry really latches onto about his mother is that she sacrificed her life for his and that she was friends with Snape neither of which apply to Ginny.

And as a redhead, it's depressing to me that apparently everyone thinks we all look alike. My dad was a redhead but I assure you, their isn't anything remotely weird about me also finding Prince Harry attractive.
