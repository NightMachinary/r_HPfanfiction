I have another tab open right now to a time travel fic where Hermione goes back to the Marauder era (Pride of Time) and has to live as a 5th year Gryffindor. She meets the Head Girl, Lily, and matter of factly describes her as looking "a lot like Ginny".\\
And her characterization too, in canon and not. She smart and responsible but also the girl who would befriends oddballs, take no BS from older students, with a strong sense of fairness.

Ginny is basically Lily + Quiddich and humor-as-a-weapon. So Lily+ a tinge of James.
