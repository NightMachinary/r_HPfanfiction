Except its not even the same shade of red. And Lily's hair is described as shorter, and lily herself is inferred to be much taller. And I'm not even sure its ever described as straight. Ginny could've had wavy hair. Also, I believe Susan Bones had red hair.

Regardless, the fact that both Lily and Ginny had red hair is meaningless as an argument against the pairing.
