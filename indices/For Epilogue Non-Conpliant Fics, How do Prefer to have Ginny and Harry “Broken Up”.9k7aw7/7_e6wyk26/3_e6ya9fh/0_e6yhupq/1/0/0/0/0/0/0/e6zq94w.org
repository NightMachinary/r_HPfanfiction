I will concede it is two shades of red. Meaningless? I don't see it as an argument against the pairing. Any more than noting he married his best friends sister as an entry into his surrogate family --- which is another pretty odd thing. It's not saying it's a terrible match. Just that Harry wears some of his â€˜issues' on his sleeve, as outwardly guarded as he tries to be.
