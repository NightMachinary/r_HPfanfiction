Literally all they shared was red hair, and even then it wasn't the same shade. And red heads aren't some exceedingly rare thing in the UK. The whole Oedipal argument against the ship is one of the weakest arguments.

I can respect the need to find oneself, but on the other hand there are plenty of people who marry their high school partner and still find themselves, however one defines it, while also in a relationship. I think in Harry and Ginny's case, they dated, discovered they were incredibly compatible and connected, and grew as people while still being together. Typically, the reason why high school romances don't last are circumstance (i.e.moving away for college) or growing into completely different people. But if circumstances aren't an issue, then two people can grow but still find themselves very much into their partner through that growth.

I also think the soulmate thing doesn't exist, but if it did, it wouldn't be necessitated by finding yourself first. It kind of implies the opposite of soulmates, which is actually a magical construct. Your soulmate is your soulmate, regardless of when you find yourself. Also, within the wizarding world, Rowling has said Harry and Ginny are soulmates.
