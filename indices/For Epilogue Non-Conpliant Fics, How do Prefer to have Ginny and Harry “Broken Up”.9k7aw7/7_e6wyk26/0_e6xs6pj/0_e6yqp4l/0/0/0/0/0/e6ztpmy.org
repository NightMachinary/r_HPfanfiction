I can't imagine homebody Harry either, but I don't think a relationship with Ginny precludes that. Granted Rowling already told us what happens (Harry becomes an Auror right away) but I think if Ginny went back to school, Harry could still travel. And being an Auror could still allow him to travel or at least maintain a purpose in his life. The thing is I don't know if Harry could handle having nothing to do except travel and see the sights. I think he needs the action. A lot of what Harry got up to at school was not required of him. Pursuing the stone? Trying to save Ginny? These had nothing to do with Voldemort (at the time Harry did them) and he had no obligations to do these things, yet he did. I think joining the Aurors was exactly what Harry wanted to do. Pursuing bad guys, solving mysteries, this is the stuff that is innate in Harry. Sometimes I wonder if Harry was able to do what he did in fighting Voldemort because he actually knew /exactly/ who he was at an early age.
