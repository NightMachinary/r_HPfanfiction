No worries! Always good to have a substantive conversation and debate!

  Second, my point about soulmates is just more about Harry having spent most of his pre-Ginny life being dictated to by other people. He's the good for nothing freak nephew taken in out of charity, then he's miracle baby, then it's back and forth between attention seeking trouble maker and prophecized saviour. Taking time to himself to figure out who he is and what he wants just makes more sense than tying himself to Ginny who already pretty much knows what she wants - Quidditch.

I see your point but I'd argue being with Ginny /is/ Harry making his own choices for once. She represents a normal life. When he breaks it off, he comments on how being with her was like living another life. It's really sad actually. If he had complete freedom, he would never have broken up with her. So once he gets his freedom back, it would make perfect sense to want to immediate be with her again.

Also, they just spent a year apart. He pined for her and she was his last thought. Personally, I don't see Harry up and leaving her for years while he finds himself.

  As for the similarities between Ginny and Lily, they're both under-developed characters, but what we do know about them makes them sound very similar. It's just weird that he looks so much like his dad and he found a girl that immediately reminded a lot of readers of Lily.

See, I think aside from both having red hair, which is not unique from other characters, they are not really the same. We don't know much about Lily, but she seems to not enjoy pranks like Ginny does, she seems rather more tempered, and i believe she is taller and lither. Sure, they are both brave and stick up for others, but the same could be said about a lot of people. It actually can be argued that Ginny is more like James in personality.

  In terms of the Hinny pairing in general, I think it ties Harry down a bit too early. The thing with Harry is it was very easy for him to peak during the events of the war. I don't like the cursed child partly because it kind paints Harry as someone who's more known for what he did as a 17 year old than what he did later on. If he had taken a decade to get out of the UK, gone places where he wasn't as well known and so could build an identity beyond Voldie killing machine, and then come back and gotten to know Ginny as an adult their relationship would have made more sense to me. But as it is, 19 years after Voldie dies their son James is at least a second year, which means they got married a few years after Hogwarts.

You have to remember the context. In the wizarding world, there is no college and wizards and witches seem to mature faster. They go right into the workforce upon graduation. Also, it seems that the idea of marrying your Hogwarts is rather common. I think we make the mistake of imposing our real world values and customs on the wizarding world.

Truth is, Harry will always be known for what he did at 17. It's hard for him to ever achieve something more noteworthy. I think Ginny works for him not just in general but in that moment because she is one of the few people who truly knows him as something other than the hero. His identity with her is far different than others. Harry would find himself by being with his friends who truly know him rather than alone. I agree that what you proposed would work for a lot of people who would be in similar situations, but I don't think it would work for Harry. But that's just a different perspective.
