But see, now you're being reasonable which completely ruins my argument. I guess my problem would be homebody Harry - I can't imagine having the financial security (Black inheritance added to what was left of trustfund) to travel around for decades and a whole magical world to explore, but deciding to stay home instead. However, Molly wouldn't let Ginny out of her sight so soon after everything so a relationship with her ties Harry securely to the UK.
