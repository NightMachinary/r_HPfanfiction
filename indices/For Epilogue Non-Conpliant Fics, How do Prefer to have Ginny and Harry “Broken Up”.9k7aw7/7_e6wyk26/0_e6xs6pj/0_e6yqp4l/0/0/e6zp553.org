So, first, I'm actually enjoying this conversation so don't take it as me being argumentative or anything. I'm writing something right now and Ginny hasn't entered the story yet, so talking this through will help me decide how to write her.

Second, my point about soulmates is just more about Harry having spent most of his pre-Ginny life being dictated to by other people. He's the good for nothing freak nephew taken in out of charity, then he's miracle baby, then it's back and forth between attention seeking trouble maker and prophecized saviour. Taking time to himself to figure out who he is and what he wants just makes more sense than tying himself to Ginny who already pretty much knows what she wants - Quidditch.

As for the similarities between Ginny and Lily, they're both under-developed characters, but what we do know about them makes them sound very similar. It's just weird that he looks so much like his dad and he found a girl that immediately reminded a lot of readers of Lily.

In terms of the Hinny pairing in general, I think it ties Harry down a bit too early. The thing with Harry is it was very easy for him to peak during the events of the war. I don't like the cursed child partly because it kind paints Harry as someone who's more known for what he did as a 17 year old than what he did later on. If he had taken a decade to get out of the UK, gone places where he wasn't as well known and so could build an identity beyond Voldie killing machine, and then come back and gotten to know Ginny as an adult their relationship would have made more sense to me. But as it is, 19 years after Voldie dies their son James is at least a second year, which means they got married a few years after Hogwarts.
