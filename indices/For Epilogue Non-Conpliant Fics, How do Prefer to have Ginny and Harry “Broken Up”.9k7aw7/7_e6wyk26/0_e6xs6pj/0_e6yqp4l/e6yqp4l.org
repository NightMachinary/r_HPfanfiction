I'm one of the people who believes someone first needs to 'find themselves' before finding their soulmate. Harry, due to his life circumstances, hasn't had time to find out who he wants to be (not what other people expect him to be - bad egg, hero, etc). Considering magicals seem to have longer lifespans, Harry can afford to wait a decade or two before looking to settle down. As for the Oedipal thing, it's just weird that Harry latched on to the one red-haired Gryffindor girl.
