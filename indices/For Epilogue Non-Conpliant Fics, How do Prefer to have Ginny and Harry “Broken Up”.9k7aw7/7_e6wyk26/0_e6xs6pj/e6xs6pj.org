I don't really understand the Oedipal interpretation of the H/G pairing. Though fanon Lily and Ginny share some traits, canon doesn't give us much about Lily's personality (apart from bravery, and that Slughorn thought she was good at potions) If JKR wanted a romantic happy ending, there were only 3 women for Harry- Hermione, Ginny or Luna. No other romance would have made sense in the epilogue, because Harry would have had to meet and get to know the girl between the War and the epilogue.
