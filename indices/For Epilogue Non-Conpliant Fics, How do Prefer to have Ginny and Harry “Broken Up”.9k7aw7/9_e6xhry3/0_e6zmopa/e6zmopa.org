Eh...I don't know if that would be true to canon though. Then again I'd argue them breaking up at all wouldn't be true to canon, but for the sake of argument, I don't think there is any indication that Ginny or Harry would handle fame in a way that would cause them to break up. Harry is uncomfortable with fame, but on the other hand a lot of that is explicitly tied to being the Chosen One. In GoF, he had grand ideas of being a tri-wizard champion and being celebrated as a hero. He also never seemed to mind getting attention for Quidditch. Ginny seems nonplussed by fame and rumor; recall her scoffing at Romilda Vane asking about her relationship with Harry.
