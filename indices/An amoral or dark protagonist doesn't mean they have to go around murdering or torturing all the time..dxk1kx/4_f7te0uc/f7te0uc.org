IMO, the dark side is summed up best by Voldemort in book one. "There is no good and evil, only power and those too weak to seek it." Light cannot exist without creating shadow, and darkness is but the absence of light. Voldemort and Dumbledore both act to destroy the opposing side,not realizing they can't. Calling something dark is stupid, because darkness and evil are two separate traits, granted, ones that enjoy each other's presence, but separate nonetheless.
