What's your pseudonym and what fic site do you use? I'm always up for some good Ron fics.

I have a weakness for Slytherin ron but the mafia boss stuff is sometimes too much to handle. The one exception is Fate, because I can shove it all under the "he's not just 13, he's possessed by a god/eldritch horror/abomination and is very likely merging with it". Even then that only does so much...
