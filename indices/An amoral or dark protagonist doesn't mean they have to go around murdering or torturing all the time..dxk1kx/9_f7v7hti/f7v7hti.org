I think i might actually write a ron-centric amoral protagonist story just because I've never seen one. Death eater Ron is an established trope but none of those fics are about him. I've seen one where he's sorted into slytherin, but it had gross mafia boss preteens.

I'm going to make an actually good one.

Even though I have two Ron stories in progress I haven't updated in forever. Fuck.
