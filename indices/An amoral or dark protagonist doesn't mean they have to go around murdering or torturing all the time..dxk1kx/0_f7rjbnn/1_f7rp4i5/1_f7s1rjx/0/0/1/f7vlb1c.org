I will never understand Tomarry.

Lord Voldemort is an unredeemable character - that's how he was designed. He is a children's book antagonist grown into a young-adult book antagonist.

He is absolute, irredeemable, evil. In fact, involving him in a story like this would be detrimental.

He sees people in one of four cathegories:

one, unworth of life. Muggles, muggleborn, people who oppose him.

two, subservient. Those who take his mark.

three, a threat. Those equal or more powerful than him.

four, himself. the greatest of them all.

He's a populist that believes his own lies, a story-spinner that believes his own legend. He is also emotionless, about 70 years older than Harry, corrupted by the dark arts into an abomination and wants nothing but destruction.

You can either keep his character intact or stay faithful to my prompt, not both. It's not possible at face value.

But apart from that, the age difference and tonal dissinance is just too fucking jarring for me. No offense, but I dislike reading pedophilic pairings. or ones about literal snake satan dating an 18 year old.

Are you aware that there are more male characters beside draco and lord voldemort? many who would be much more interesting than either, too - a lightside character would provide some fun contrast. some near-oc character without a canon-personality would be a blank slate.
