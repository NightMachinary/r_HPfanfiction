Sorry, but that just sounded insulting.

I get that you don't like it, but it isn't wrong to like it, just like it's not wrong to dislike it.

Voldemort is insane, he split his soul, after all. He /can/ regain his sanity and be cured.

I am well aware that there are more characters.

So what? You don't like Tomarry, I don't like other pairings than that and Drarry.

You say I can't make a Tomarry with this prompt.

I say I can.

You may not be able to imagine it, but others can.

Regards,
