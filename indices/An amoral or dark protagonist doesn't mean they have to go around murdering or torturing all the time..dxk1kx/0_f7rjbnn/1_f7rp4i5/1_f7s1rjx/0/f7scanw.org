Just please make it believable, so no teacher-student pairings, no deatheater-lightside pairings and stuff of that nature. They take me right out of the action, tbh.

Also, can you take it sloooow with the romance? A little fluff before the storm?

For instance, I can appreciate a good harry/other male student pairing (so long as the story isn't 90% smut, which can be a problem with any fic tbh), but harry/literal voldemort? nah. takes me right out.

Additionally... start when they're older? like, beyond fifth or sixth year? I'm not a real fan of preteen romances or pedophilia, you understand. Not to mention it makes a knowledgeable protagonist more believable.

Maybe the big bad had a setback and is hiding, so there's no pressure on a fourth year to go out and fight.
