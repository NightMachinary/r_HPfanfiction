Sooo, I'm not big into self promotion, but I do have a 5th year Harry/Draco fic that hits on quite a bit of the Dark!Harry stuff you've mentioned, and it's slow-burn (and I don't write smut so you don't have to worry about that). It's still a WIP, and Harry is re-sorted into Slytherin (not Ravenclaw) after he starts exploring the dark arts. Dark doesn't mean evil in my fic cuz it's just more interesting that way. :)

It may or may not be your cup of tea, but I thought I'd throw it out there anyway.

Let's see if the link bot works, it never does for me...
