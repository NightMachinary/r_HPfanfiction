Light Harry - Dumbledore Jr, everybody deserves a second chance, follows what everybody says he should do.

Grey Harry - Still a good person and aiming for the betterment of society but willing to go to more extreme lengths to stop Voldemort which may include killing death eaters and using dark magic. Harry is more self aware and less likely to blindly trust people because others do.

Dark Harry - A Harry that is more selfish and looking only to achieve his goals no matter who gets hurt on the way. The ends justify the means. Usually a more political Harry who aims to put his family back on top.

Evil Harry - The world fucked me over so its time ti fuck the world back. Sadistic Harry who is obsessed with getting back at everyone and has less defined goals other than getting back at everyone who hurt him.

An example of how each would face the same scenario is the Dursley's.

Light Harry forgives them and still stays there because Dumbledore says so.

Grey Harry says no and leaves them, doesn't care what happens beyond that, he just puts it behind him and forgets about it.

Dark Harry wants a bit of pay back and oerhaos uses his wealth or political clout to get Vernon demoted and Dudley expelled to just genuinely make life difficult for them and ruin their reputation of being good people.

Evil Harry slaughters them and never looks back, perhaps even tortured them for what they did to him.
