Mood! I've always thought that the typical DarkHarry fics (where dark means evil) were way to involved in the world (like, if you're going to be evil then you don't care if werewolves have rights. Seriously.)

I've also thought it a little odd that the only times Harry kills people in fic is when he's a rabid beast. I'd much rather see pre-meditated and careful murder (please give me bb 15 yr old Harry's thought process as he works through why and how to kill Umbrage), Or, alternatively, a Light!Harry who firmly believes in Dumbledore's greater good and the other concepts of utilitarianism to the point where he's down to murder.
