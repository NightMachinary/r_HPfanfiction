If you want a dark and slightly immoral Harey then check out this: Linkffn(In the Mind of a Scientist) A brilliant fic with a very good sequel. Not so much dark as just without morals and pursuing science. Does a but of cross genetic experimentation and the sort. Has some het romance but it doesnt dominate the story (at least I dont think it does but then I am a Harry/multi regular). Check it out at least. You might like it.
