I LOVE self-fashioning, it's exactly the kind of amoral harry fic I want. He just doesn't give a fuck about the rules, but isn't unnaturally cruel for no reason.

Haven't read On The Way To Greatness, but I will soon.

And that third one is on my shitlist since I learned that it's basically an adult man grooming children. Kinda not ok.

That last one was good, but it just moves soooo fucking slow I can't even be invested in it.
