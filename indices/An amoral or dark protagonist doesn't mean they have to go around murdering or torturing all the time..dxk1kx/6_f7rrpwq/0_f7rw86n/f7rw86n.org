He's also irrationally angry and psychotic, probably due to his magical prowess. All the best written Voldemort POV fics I've read, his rationale toward indiscriminate pain and death are basically because he's always gotta be in control and he's capable of it. Like if Dumbledore went off the deep end and really just started /forcing/ people to do what he wanted.

The funny thing is Voldemort spent decades putting all his little pieces together, from his first Horcrux to graduating to finding the artefacts to disappearing for a while to putting together the Knights Walpurgis and so on. He's incredibly irrational in canon but has the ability to meddle in a fashion one could argue is clearly Dumbledore-esque.
