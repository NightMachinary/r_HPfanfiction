That's... huh. I hadn't thought of that. That does make a certain amount of sense. You have to prove yourself a great leader by the metric of those you seek to lead. If they value cruelty, then you have to be the cruelest. Much like if they value kindness and charity, you have to be the kindest and most charitable.

It's an error due to the fact that in the modern world most people value things other then cruelty in a leader, so most have a hard time realizing that for those that do, voldemorts actions are ideal.
