Regarding Voldemort torturing his own minions: I initially shared your objection to what seems to be a ludicrously counterproductive management technique, but then a friend pointed out that these particular minions have the utmost respect for pointless cruelty. Anyone seeking to ensure the loyalty of these minions needs to prove himself to be a qualified leader by their standards, and that means flaunting his cruelty.

Since, if anyone actually has that mindset, I try to avoid them, I don't know if minion-management actually works like this, but it seems like a possibility. What seems like pointless cruelty might actually be carefully-thought-out minion management.

Of course, there's also something to be said for trying to recruit a better class of minion, but maybe he just did the best he could with the resources available to him.
