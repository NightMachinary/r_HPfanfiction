  They can't go around murdering indescriminantly with no consequences of any kind, or without reason.

Ah, the Murder Hobo character archetype.

Most these issues are tied up with authors who write a meta-story, where the protagonist doesn't act according to an internal motivation, but to some artificial meta-force or author-induced railroading. Book Harry wants a home with friends and family who loves him, to survive the school year, be the son his parents would be proud of. Your typical Fanfic "Dark Harry" is an edgelord with a justice boner who acts and exists only to "right the wrongs" of canon.

A true amoral character doesn't care about conventional definitions of right or wrong when they act. They also can't just pick and choose when to be amoral or not. You see this in badly-written stories where Dark Amoral Harry murders Death Eaters willy nilly, and then gets outraged when Draco steals Neville's Remembrall and tosses it on the roof.

I think the main problem stems from authors writing Harry's story like it's a role-playing campaign, instead of an established character within an established universe. Of course authors are going to write what appeals to them, but this winds up turning into a plot that doesn't follow any internal logic or consistency - only what the author wants to happen.

You can see this Deathly Hallows. JKR wanted to write a "Suffering Harry" by making him starve in the tent during the Horcrux Hunt, but made everyone forget about basic charms, invisibility cloaks, and muggle supermarkets to ramp up the SuFfErInG.
