There's a difference between an actual amoral character and a character that just has different morals from the rest of the setting or the rest of our world. Personally, I don't think there's anything wrong with killing DEs in combat and then getting upset about the Remembrall. Or even murdering DEs in their sleep, or really anyone the MC doesn't like and then getting upset about the Remembrall. People can be murderous towards their enemies /and/ not like when someone bullies their friends. They should just not be called amoral then, but at least the fics I have seen that do such things call their Harry "Dark" and not "amoral".
