  I see this all the time in "DaRk!HaRrY" fics, where he just randomly murders someone (Tonks, or Ron, or whoever else) either for shock value or to show how eeeevil he is.

  That's about the level of canon Voldemort, who is a mustache-twirling villain, not a convincing dark character. (seriously, you can't run an organisation by constantly torturing your officers and soldiers with a spell known to cause brain and nerve damage) Not to mention when it happens in "grey" fics, which are often darker than those aforementioned "dark" ones.

Chaotic Evil.

  An amoral or dark character acts much less like a rabid beast (notice how Greyback is used in most fics - as a weapon), but as a self-interested person only out for their own goals. The lengths they are willing to go to define if the character is dark, grey or light.

Neutral Evil.

  You can make a dark character with any motivation, too - a character doesn't meed to have ruling ambitions or destructive tendencies to be so. For instance, you could make a Dark!Ravenclaw!Harry who does not shy back from experimenting with integrating basilisk biology into his own, or researching phoenix immortality, even if it causes pain or death to said phoenix.

  And lastly, a dark!character still needs to integrate into the story's world - They can't go around murdering indescriminantly with no consequences of any kind, or without reason.

Lawful Evil.
