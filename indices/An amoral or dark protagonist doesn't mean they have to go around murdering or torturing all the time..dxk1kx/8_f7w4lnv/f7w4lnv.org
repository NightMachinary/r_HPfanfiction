Pretty much what you said. But then, that's fanfics. Most of the authors that write them are not good at it, I'd wager a lot of them are rather immature, and hell, they are writing fanfic for a world that is all entirely black and white morality, where white means good and pure and always nice and forgiving and empathetic, and black means dark and evil and cruel and psychopathic. Hell, there's a lot of full grown adults that have issues understanding that dark/evil doesn't have to mean wantonly cruel and murderous.

Light/Good/Empathic/Selfless\\
Dark/Evil/Sociopathic/Selfish\\
Everyone's on a point somewhere on a sliding scale between the two. How much do you care about other peoples wants/needs versus how much you care about your own wants/needs. Of course, in reality, even someone leaning heavily towards the selfish side will have exceptions, things they won't do, people they consider significantly more important, etc.\\
But that's too complex for many authors, so they just crank up the selfish side to maximum, to the point that a few moments of personal amusement is worth more then another persons life. Usually to the absurd point of stupidity. Hell, Canon!Voldemort is exactly that, cranked 110% to the selfish side, with a healthy dollop of that "Evil-induced-stupidity". Such as torturing his followers with a curse that causes brain/nerve damage.

It would be nice to read some good dark!harry stories that can handle morality in a less childish ways, but alas, the vast majority of fanfic writers are shit, and have self control issues, they just cant seem to help taking everything to the extreme. Sometimes it comes through in harry having a harem of every named, and unnamed girl, complete with expy girls from other materials. Sometimes it comes through as literally every wizard in the world being gay. And sometimes that comes through as a murderous psychopath harry that just can't stop killing for even a single chapter. And all without any consequences from the world at large.
