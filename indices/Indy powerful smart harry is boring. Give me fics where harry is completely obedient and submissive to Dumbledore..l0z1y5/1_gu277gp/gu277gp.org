Indy! Harry is boring because most people write as a blatant power trip with no stakes or reason to be invested. Submissive Harry is an equally bad idea. The hero of the story is directed about like a lost and stupid puppy? Why would you read that. People don't like yesmen, unless they're exploiting said yesmen. An independent hero with agency actively working to defeat his enemies and save his friends is infinitely more enjoyable than a spineless bootlicker because heroes are supposed to be impressive an inspirational in some manner. If you're main character is an out and out wimp people won't like it.
