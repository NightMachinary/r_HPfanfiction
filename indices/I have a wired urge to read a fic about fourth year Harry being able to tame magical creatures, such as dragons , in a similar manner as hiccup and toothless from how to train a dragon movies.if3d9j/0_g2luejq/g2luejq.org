I had this thought the other day where in the first challenge of the Triwizard Tournament instead of flying or restraining the dragon he does what basically no other wizard ever tried before.

​

He uses cheering charms or infatuation/love charms because he realized that like him, the dragon didn't really want to be there either. Makes nice with the dragon, no parsel tongue or anything, just treating the dragon like a startled dog while pushing his magic into the charms to keep it calm and liking him.

​

I had another idea where, after Moody/Crouch Jr's Imperious curse showcase and the offhand remark that you can only be charged for using it on a human, he uses that on the dragon and gets it to give him the golden egg. That causes obvious problems later on but that train of thought had the shocked silence after the act breaking with Karakov or whatever his name is, giving Harry a 10 with a smirk on his face
