I think it's really good and worth reading on past that point. Such a heavy event befalling a main character is a direction that few authors ever have the guts to do (threatened rape is not uncommon, but it actually happening is rare). I don't think that the author handled the event that well though. The act of it happening was well executed in my opinion as it has a pretty big impact on the story at that point, but the fallout of it all is pretty flat. The ramifcations later in the story are pretty minimal from what I remember so you could just read around it and still follow along pretty easily.
