femslash with Susan Bones is linkffn(To Reach Without by inwardtransience) ... it starts rather well (although, the stress of being changed into a girl is so crazily high, it is unbelievable), but then it got so smutty, I haven't finished it. And the worst part of the fic is its title ... I never can find it again in my archive with this name.
