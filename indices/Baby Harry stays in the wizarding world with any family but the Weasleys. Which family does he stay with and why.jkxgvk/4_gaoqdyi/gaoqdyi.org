I'm thinking Albus would probably do all he could to keep him away from the Malfoys, given he's well aware Lucius is an actual Death Eater (despite what his money says). There are other families with just as much of a claim and none of the suspicion.

Barring this AU keeping Sirius out of Azkaban (which would happen if Sirius was given custody immediately, without getting the chance to go after Pettigrew) I think the Tonks family is a relatively safe option - distantly related, a definitely-on-the-good-side family, and not currently in Azkaban.

Another option I can see being taken is the full-on disguise route. Harry wouldn't be the only child orphaned by the Wizarding War, it'd be easy enough to blend him into whichever system is already in place to take care of them and then just keep an eye out for wherever he ends up. In that case, all bets are off and he could end up anywhere.
