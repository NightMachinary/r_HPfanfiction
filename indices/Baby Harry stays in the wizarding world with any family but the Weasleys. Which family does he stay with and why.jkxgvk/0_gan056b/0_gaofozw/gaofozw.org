Agree with Tonks - just because Malfoy bribed his way/imperius defence out of going to Azkaban, doesn't mean people would think he's suitable to take guardianship over Harry. Even in canon most of the “light side” were reasonably sure he was full of shit, I can't imagine they'd let him take Harry on top of everything else.

As for Pandora, while it's true that we never learn her maiden name, the likelihood of her being even somewhat related to Harry and no one ever mentioning it is extremely low.
