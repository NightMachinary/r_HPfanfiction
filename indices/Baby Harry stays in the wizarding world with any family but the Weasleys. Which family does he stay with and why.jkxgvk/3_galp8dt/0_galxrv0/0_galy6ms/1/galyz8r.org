Sirius grows into the role of a father figure.

whose constantly thinking about if he is doing right by James and Lilly in how he raises harry.

I honestly imagine harry would become friends with Ron from a younger age

as sirius would worry harry would be lonely with only two adults for company

so he visits someone he knows due to an incident with his bike that shares his values and has a kid harry's age.
