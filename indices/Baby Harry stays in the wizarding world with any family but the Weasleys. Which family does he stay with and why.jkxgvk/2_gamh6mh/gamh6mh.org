Narcissa Malfoy's Great Aunt was also Great Aunt of Harry's Godfather and was Harry's Grand Mother. And as far as the Ministry was concerned, Lucius and Narcissa were cleared of all wrong doings. Its perfectly conceivable that Harry would be placed with the Malfoy's, they're blood relatives (not necessarily close, but also not particularly far apart on the family tree), wealthy, and have a similarly aged child of their own. I imagine those 3 factors may weigh heavily in their favour, especially if they also expressed a clear desire to foster Harry. Which I imagine they might, given half a chance, since its the perfect way to rehabilitate their image in the public eye.
