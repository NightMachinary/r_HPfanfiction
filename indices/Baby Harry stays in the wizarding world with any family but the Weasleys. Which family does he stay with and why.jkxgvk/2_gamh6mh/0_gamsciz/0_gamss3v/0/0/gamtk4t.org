True, he could have put up violent resistance to Harry being placed with the Malfoys. But think about it logically. Dumbledore is the sort of man who tends to obey the rule of law, and work from within to effect change. If the Ministry placed Harry with the Malfoys following all the laws of the land, then Dumbledore would have to decide either to accept it and perhaps try to protect Harry from the background, or swoop in and kidnap Harry. He's not going to do the latter when he knows that it would result with him being branded a criminal and losing all influence.
