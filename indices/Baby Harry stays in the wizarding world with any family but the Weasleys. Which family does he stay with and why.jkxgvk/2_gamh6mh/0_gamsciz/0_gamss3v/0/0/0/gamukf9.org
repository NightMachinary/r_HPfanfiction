Well, lol.

Isn't that exactly what he /did/? He doesn't cite it as a reason specifically -- that was all about protection (and Harry not getting a big head) --, but if I were Dumbledore, then precisely /because/ families like the Malfoys are a logical outcome, I'm rather removing him from the wizarding world entirely, before anyone even knows what's up.

Violent resistance isn't Dumbledore's style, no. Instead, he just does wtf he wants, and looks droll at other people when they try to arrest him.
