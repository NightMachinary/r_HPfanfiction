Firefox with [[https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages][Reader mode]], but mostly I download EPubs with [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare][FanFicFare]]. Generally I think AO3 has hugely more readable web than FFnet, but that's probably just an opinion.
