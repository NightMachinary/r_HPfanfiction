I'm thinking Neville will work best as a side character, trying to follow 5 would be to much especially just the first episode when trying to show Harry and Hermione learn they are wizards, everyone go get their school stuff and then be sorted at Hogwarts.

With just the 4 characters it may feel like it is jumping around too much and it will be difficult to balance

I have been considering having Neville be a hufflepuff like he wants, and be Ron's friend, he would help Ron accept being a hufflepuff aswell as in book 4 when he is fighting with Harry. He would be a side character until then who just has shit happen to him.
