Well my theory suggests his specific reason would be Harry turning 11 and going to Hogwarts. Up until then he had been hidden away but now he'd be out and about and ripe for killing. In fact how convenient that the day Harry goes to Diagon Alley Quirrel happens to be there too, maybe he kept the Stone at Gringotts so that the day Harry goes to buy supplies an agent of Voldemort would have to decide between killing Harry or making an attempt on the stone. And on the same day that decoy is no longer needed he has the stone removed.
