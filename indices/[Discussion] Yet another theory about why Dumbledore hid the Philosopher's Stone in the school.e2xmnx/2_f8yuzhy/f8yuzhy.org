I think this works if we assume that Dumbledore has a specific reason to think that Voldemort's spirit would come back to the UK that year. Maybe I'm muddled from all the fanfics, but I don't recall that ever being full explained. I've always assumed that the Philosopher's stone was not originally in Gringotts, but kept there temporarily, and somehow that's what got his attention. Or perhaps Dumbledore merely put out some rumors and had a fake stone in the vault.... Just to see if anyone would bite.
