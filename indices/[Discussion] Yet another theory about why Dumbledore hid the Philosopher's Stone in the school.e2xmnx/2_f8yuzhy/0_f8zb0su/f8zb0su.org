It's been a very long time since I read the books, but wasn't it implied at one point that somebody had made an attempt on the stone already? I thought that's why it was moved to Gringotts in the first place. Once it was moved there, Dumbledore believed (rightly so) that Hogwarts was a much safer place for the stone than Gringotts.

I'm not sure if that first part was canon; I know that's what I've believed since before I discovered fanfiction, but I was younger when I last read the books so it's entirely possible that I was just making assumptions.
