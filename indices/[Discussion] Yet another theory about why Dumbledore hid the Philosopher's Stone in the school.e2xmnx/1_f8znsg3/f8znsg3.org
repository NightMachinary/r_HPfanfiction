Alternatively, it was a test. In the sense that, in a sort of manipulative way, Dumbledore was enticing Voldemort to Hogwarts to confirm that he did indeed survive.

Dumbledore obviously believed Voldemort didn't fully die that night when he faced Baby Harry, but nobody could prove that (not even him). So how does he? Simple. He concocted a scenario where Voldemort would have no reason NOT to appear.

In the same year that Harry James Potter, the boy who destroyed him all those years ago, enters Hogwarts for the first time, he places the Philosopher's Stone in the school. Dumbledore turning Hogwarts into a Voldemort-themed mousetrap with Harry AND the Stone being the bait.

If the year goes by and neither of them are interfered with... then maybe Voldemort DID die all those years ago. But if one of them is attacked then BOOM, Dumbledore's right and Tom IS still out there.
