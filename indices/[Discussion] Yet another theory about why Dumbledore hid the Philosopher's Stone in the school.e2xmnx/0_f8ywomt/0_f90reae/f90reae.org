  And other protections... well they couldn't be too deadly or some overly curious student would go and get themselves killed or maimed. And that way a bunch of first years managed to do it all.

I actually considered this a possibility but the problem is some of the protections could potentially be deadly. The Devil's Snare for one, as well as the Troll and the Poison. Unless it was all just theatricality and these were child safe versions and bluffs which I think is possible.

However I have another theory about why they aren't too deadly to first years. Dumbledore knows the at least four children of former death eaters will be starting school that year. Maybe he fears Voldemort would use them to get the stone for him and wanted to ensure that the kid wouldn't get killed in the process. I think Fluffy is enough to deter any students who are just idly curious.
