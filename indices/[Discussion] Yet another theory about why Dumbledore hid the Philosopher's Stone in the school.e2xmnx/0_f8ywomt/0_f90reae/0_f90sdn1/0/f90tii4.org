I think you needed fire in the book. But we know Devil's Snare /can/ be deadly from OoTP when someone in St Mungo's is assassinated by it. I don't know if it's easy to recognize or if Hermione is just a nerd. True about the troll though, you could just leave and it's probably the most difficult challenge. The fire probably is real though since getting past the troll means you're a serious customer.
