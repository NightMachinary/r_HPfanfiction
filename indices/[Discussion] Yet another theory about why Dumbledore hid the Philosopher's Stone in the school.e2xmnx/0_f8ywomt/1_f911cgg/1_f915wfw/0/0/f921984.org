but Snape wasn't after the stone at all, Harry assumed it was Fluffy but we never actually confirm what caused the injury. He can't have been looking for Quirell there to stop him because the dude was unconscious in the great hall. That does brong uo the question of what actually caused the injury and if it was fluffy why was he there.
