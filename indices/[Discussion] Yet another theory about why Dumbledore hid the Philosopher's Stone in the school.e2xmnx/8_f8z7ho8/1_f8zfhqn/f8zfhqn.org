1. Voldemort literally tried to straight up murder Harry multiple times. I agree that "using the power of your enemy...that was the cause of your downfall" would be incredibly logical and wise, to an extent. However, consider that it also helped Harry (allowing him to come back from the second Killing Curse) and Voldemort wanted Harry dead in Philosopher's Stone, I think we can agree that he wasn't thinking that far ahead or logically at the time.\\
2. We know literally nothing about the Philospher's Stone other than who it was created by, what it looks like, that it's responsible for the Elixir of Life, and is a source for unlimited gold. This whole "cannot transmute into organics" is completely head-canon on your part or fanon.\\
3. The double fidelius? That is not something that has ever been discussed or mentioned in canon at all, again you are pulling information from fanon and head-canon material. We don't know the exact limitations of the Fidelius Charm yet, but we could speculate on why it wasn't used. Personally, I do believe that the stone should have been moved to a location under the /normal/ Fidelius Charm, with Dumbledore as Secret Keeper. However, that /entirely defeats the purpose of Dumbledore using the Stone./ Dumbledore used the stone as a way to bait out Voldemort; to finally confirm that he's still alive (if only just barely) and possibly capture/stop him.\\
4. You're assuming Horcruxes are the only way to keep someone alive. It's hinted at by Dumbledore that there are other ways to keep someone alive, horcruxes just being the most extreme. Even Voldemort mentions there are multiple experiments that could have helped him survive in the graveyard: "it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked... for I had not been killed." Dumbledore didn't /know/ about the horcruxes, though he suspected, until he saw the diary in CoS. Even that confounded him, however; because though he had considered a horcrux, he had never considered /horcruxes./ Voldemort was the first to imagine splitting the soul multiple times to ensure immortality. "Voldemort was referring to his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry, which I do not believe any other wizard has ever had.

I mean, overall I think the OP theory is a bit fun but lacking in solid verifiable proof (splitting attention between stone and Harry, etc.), but your counterarguments are rough my dude.
