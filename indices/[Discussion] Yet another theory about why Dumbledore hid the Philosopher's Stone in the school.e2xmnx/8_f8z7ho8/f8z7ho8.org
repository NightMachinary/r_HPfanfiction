I will answer to those arguments with those counter-arguments :

1. The Dark Lord priority was not to kill Harry before regaining his body and power. Using the power of your enemy designated by prophecy and that was the cause of your downfall in the fist place is more logical and used in many circumstances.
2. The Stone power does not include to recreate what was lost but only to gift whose who seek it longevity of life or riches. The Stone is a product of Alchemy, the art of transmutation of Metals and others materials. It cannot transmute into organics.
3. The Stone could have been hidden in a public location but the precise emplacement protected by a double fidelius.
4. If Dumbledore did not know about the horcruxes before the diary, he could not know that Tom was alive because Horcruxes are the only way available to Voldemort to obtain invulnerability to the veil between the physical word and the spirit world (death).

Finally Your arguments are more of the card castle or trump legal counsel on the prerogative power of the presidential office.
