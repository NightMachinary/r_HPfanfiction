1. He literally tries to kill Harry multiple times during Philosopher's Stone, he's very much interested in killing him.\\
2. Well Voldemort certainly seemed to believe it would bring him back, we know literally nothing about the stone or alchemy beyond immortality and gold.\\
3. Nowhere do we ever hear of this double fidelius stuff and for all we know you can't hide objects with the fidelius anyway.\\
4. He knew Voldemort was alive, he didn't know how or why, but he knew he was in Albania in some weakened form. He's not even the only one, plenty of people didn't think he was really dead. Noone even knew exactly what happened that night, just that he failed to kill Harry and wasn't around anymore.
