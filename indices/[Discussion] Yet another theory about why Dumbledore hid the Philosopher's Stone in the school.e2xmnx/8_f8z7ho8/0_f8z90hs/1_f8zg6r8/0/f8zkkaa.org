  1. All his tries where intended only to main him or to incapacity him in a way that would close Harry the door to power. If he wanted to kill him efficiently he would have fired an AK in the Gryffindor dorms when all of them are sleeping (There are no protection against teachers)

He was clearly trying not to be caught, on account of not being nearly strong enough to fight other adult wizards and not wanting to lose the host he'd waited a decade for.

  1. I said Longevity the elixir of life nor the stone protect against death by magic or external cause, it protects only against death by age => Longevity

He was explicitly looking for the stone. I really don't see where you're getting the idea it wouldn't help it.

  1. I said to hide the precise emplacement no the objects, the fidelius can hide only intangible concept deemed secrets (the secret of the the Secret keeper)

  1. People believed him death because they did believe the drivel of the Ministry in 5th Year and they celebrated his demise.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore didn't, Hagrid didn't, many death eaters didn't (because they're still marked), along with no doubt plenty of others.\\
5th year was new propaganda.

Hagrid literally states that Dumbledore doesn't believe him dead.
