He never thought Voldemort was dead. The guy you replied to even said "He knew Voldemort was alive..", so I assume you misread or replied to the wrong person.

Regardless, I believe the blood protection was used to protect Harry not only from Voldemort, but primarily from Voldemort's supporters. The Death Eaters weren't exactly a moral or kind bunch, they were incredibly powerful and influential, and some of them got off completely free by claiming the Imperious (Malfoy) or making deals (Karkaroff). Harry was very much in danger moving forward, all it took was one Death Eater to learn his location to end the Boy-Who-Lived.
