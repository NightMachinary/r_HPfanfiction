There is a massive hole in this theory.

Simply put, the nature of the traps and Dumbledores announcement to the school. The way the mirror works, the other traps were neither necessary to delay, nor even hard enough to really delay Voldemort. He could easily have bypassed all the traps without even thinking about fiendfyre regardless. The only reason he likely "played along" is to try and maintain his cover as a professor. And if his sole purpose was to distract Voldemort, Dumbledore really never needed to announce the corridor was off limits to the school because any competent adult wizard could have secured the area to where students would not have been able to investigate it much less blunder into it.

As for the stone itself. I have long been of the opinion that the stone was a fake and either Dumbledore knew it, or Flamel provided a fake without Dumbledores knowledge. It simply makes no sense for this event to be what causes the Flamels to decide to "pass on", especially after all that had happened in the prior century.

But the most important aspect is that it is simply unbelievable that Dumbledore was unaware there was something up with Quirrell. Even if he did not know it was Voldmort, the fact that snape was "stalking" him suggests there was some awareness or concern already. And since Snape is technically under Dumbledores "employ" in more ways than one, it was likely Dumbledore who had Snape checking out Quirrell. And if this was the case, why allow him to teach children in the first place unless hes manipulating the situation.
