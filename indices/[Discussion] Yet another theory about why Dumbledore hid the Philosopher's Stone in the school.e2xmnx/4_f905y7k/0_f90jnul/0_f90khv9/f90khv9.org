  Dumbledore doesn't know Voldemort has already entered the school or that he is among the teachers.

We don't know this. There is no evidence he does or does not know. But we can infer that from Snape keeping an eye on him, that at least snape suspects Voldemorts influence and therefor Dumbledore likely knows that there is at least influence at work.

  He makes the announcement to the students hoping they all write home about the crazy headmaster and spreads the word out for the third floor corridor to be a big juicy dangling Philosopher's Stone to aim for instead of the ready-to-murder Harry cooling on the windowsill nearby.

Except that all he states is the coordior is off limits aka dangerous. Hell it could simply be unstable or magic gone wild. So no one is going to write home about the stone specifically or anything similar, and its likely more of a curiousity for the students than a reason to write a big long thing home about.

  The reason he had multiple teachers devise multiple easily bypassed traps is he knows how paranoid Voldemort is. Theoretically Voldemort doesn't know what the other traps are besides his own. So even if he does figure one of them out and it sounds ridiculous (catch the flying key), he might think it was a ploy by Dumbledore to lure him into a false sense of security and the next room is just a doorknob with a flesh eating dark curse. My theory is that the first room Fluffy is essentially harmless and any primarily there to scare off any students who do stumble into it.

Ok this is just a straight up reach. I get your point but its highly unlikely he designed the traps because of Voldemorts "paranoid" nature. There would be far better ways to do it. And as for Fluffy... uh hes not remotely "harmless". He would eat a student if a student stumbled across him and did not get out asap.
