  If your going with that chain of thought than that defeats the entire purpose behind your theory... so not sure why you bring it up.

I don't see why, it's a way of distracting Voldemort from Harry if he does manage to get into Hogwarts but it doesn't mean every one after the stone is acting on Voldemort's orders.

  O... K....? I mean we can assume a lot of things, but your logic leaves something to be desired. I mean for example, you bring up the son(s?) of former death eaters but there have been children of death eaters attending for years.

Yes and he wants all those children from other years to maybe mention it in passing too. I don't see how that contradicts what I said.

  He bites snape so... yea no.

My understanding is Snape did head for the trap door. Added to the fact he didn't leave immediately as most students would probably do and possibly Fluffy is trained to be less forgiving to adults that to children.
