  We don't know this. There is no evidence he does or does not know. But we can infer that from Snape keeping an eye on him, that at least snape suspects Voldemorts influence and therefor Dumbledore likely knows that there is at least influence at work.

Dumbledore has no way of knowing if Quirrel is acting on Voldemorts orders, for all he knows he just wants the stone for himself. As Sirius says the world isn't divided into good people and death eaters.

  Except that all he states is the coordior is off limits aka dangerous. Hell it could simply be unstable or magic gone wild. So no one is going to write home about the stone specifically or anything similar, and its likely more of a curiousity for the students than a reason to write a big long thing home about.

Yes but he probably suspects if word gets out of the mysterious dangerous third floor corridor Voldemort will put two and two together. He didn't want a big neon sign so much as a subtle way to get the word out. Third years and up might be over-heard discussing it in Hogsmead, it might just be a passing curiosity in letters home, and he knows the son of 4 former death eaters who could be in contact with the Dark Lord's just started Hogwarts that year so maybe he suspects they've been asked by their parents to look out for anything suspicious. That's why he words it so ominously, so it'll be gossiped about.

  And as for Fluffy... uh hes not remotely "harmless". He would eat a student if a student stumbled across him and did not get out asap.

It's possible he's trained to be all bark and no bite unless someone actually goes for the trapdoor but there's no real evidence one way or the other.
