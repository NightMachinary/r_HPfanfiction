Dumbledore doesn't know Voldemort has already entered the school or that he is among the teachers. He makes the announcement to the students hoping they all write home about the crazy headmaster and spreads the word out for the third floor corridor to be a big juicy dangling Philosopher's Stone to aim for instead of the ready-to-murder Harry cooling on the windowsill nearby. Heck for all he knows, one of the upper year students could be minioning for Voldemort already.

The reason he had multiple teachers devise multiple easily bypassed traps is he knows how paranoid Voldemort is. Theoretically Voldemort doesn't know what the other traps are besides the troll. So even if he does figure one of them out and it sounds ridiculous (catch the flying key), he might think it was a ploy by Dumbledore to lure him into a false sense of security and the next room is just a doorknob with a flesh eating dark curse or maybe all those chess pieces are filled with garotting gas. By setting the other tasks Dumbledore can get an indicator of who to suspect by seeing who is going around trying to gather intel from the other protectors. I also like the theory is that the first room Fluffy is essentially harmless and primarily there to scare off any students who do stumble into it.

As for Quirrel, I guess it might have been more appropriate to kick him out but without knowing his motives Dumbledore probably wanted to keep him close to ensure he didn't do something drastic or maybe if he was working for Voldemort, get information out of him. Added to the fact he was the Muggle Studies teacher for some years before becoming the DADA teacher he had probably built up a few years of goodwill. That part I will agree is somewhat manipuulative
