It sounded right when it was first told to me, but I didn't see Blaise referenced on the page and I didn't remember it being a slash fic! But thank you for confirming and telling me why it was confirmed. Is it available anywhere online anymore do you know?

I still cannot believe it was Cassandra Claire who wrote it but I mean it also makes so much sense haha

Edit: also, do we do the "solved" thing on this page or no?
