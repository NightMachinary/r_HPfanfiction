I think you may have missed it in my post. Hogwarts IS the pureblood/Slytherin school.

I think because it is the oldest and first school in the country it has a sort of untouchable status that the other schools do not. Additionally, it would receive a lot of 'donations' from pureblood families and alumni who also may or may not become members of the Wizagmot or Ministry and get official eyes looking elsewhere or agreeing to stay quiet.
