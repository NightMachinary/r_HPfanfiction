I imagined it more like the Sith Academies in the Old Republic, but that would be a cool idea.

I'd imagine the Ministry wouldn't allow the Dark Arts to outright be a part of the schools curriculum (as a class at least) but maybe a few staff sponsored clubs and a leaning towards teaching darker versions of spells in classes like DADA and Charms.
