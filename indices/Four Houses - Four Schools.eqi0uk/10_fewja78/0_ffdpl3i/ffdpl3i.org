"I so enjoy watching history warp as words pass from the lips of one to the ears of another. Imperfectly formed, half understood, poorly remembered."- The Outsider, Dishonored 2.

It's entirely possible that, over the years, Godric's school's purpose could have been perverted. As the HP world goes through wars(and remember, this school was created around 1000 years ago. Plenty of war to be found.) the regime was shifted from bravery to obedience. Quite similar to how war itself has changed through the years. Wars were thought of as grand adventures, once. It was only modern wars, predominantly the world wars, that the â€˜war is hell' mentality came into being. So perhaps Godric's School wasn't a modern military school, at first. Possibly something more akin to a fantastical adventuring academy, where heroes are molded out of children.
