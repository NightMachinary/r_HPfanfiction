One thing that canon Hogwarts lacked was good competition. The nearest magic school is Beauxbatons, which is in a different country with a different main spoken language. Any British wizard pretty much *has* to go to Hogwarts. Thus, Hogwarts has no challenges to its curriculum.

But if there were four big schools, they have to fight over students and therefore have to constantly improve themselves, or try to innovate themselves. This happens for a thousand years. This means, that on average, the entire British Wizarding world is far more educated in different things. Everyone's a lot more specialised.
