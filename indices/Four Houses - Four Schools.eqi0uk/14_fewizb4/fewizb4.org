I think it would be even better if Slytherin also created the "Slytherin School of Ambition" and Hogwarts was the school that provided well-rounded graduates. It could fun to have Hogwarts be the highest ranked, even as all four of the others constantly try to outdo Hogwarts, surpassing each other but not Hogwarts. Just my opinion though.
