I think it would be an interesting thing to look into as a way to laser focus on the positives AND negatives of the Founders ideal students and schools in a world where they all got their way. I can imagine kids like Neville, Peter and Luna had an even worse go of it in this AU universe than in canon.

And can you imagine how they would have treated poor Ginny (in a world with heightened house rivalries) after a Chamber of Secrets like incident?

I can imagine a story where Harry feels alienated after a year of being treated as a messiah/savior and then one where he was bullied and belittled by people thinking him the Heir of Slytherin.

So he does the audacious, unthinkable act of transferring schools from Gryffindor School to one of the others, leading into a story where Harry gets to experience the best and worst of the different academies way of life and doing things.

Followed his (and others) desire for societal and educational reform of the schools.
