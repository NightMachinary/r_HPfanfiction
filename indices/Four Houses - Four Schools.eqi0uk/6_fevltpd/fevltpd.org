I think it wouldn't be too good for kids to grow surrounded only by people like-minded. Would be awful for society too. Creativity, great ideas and personal growth often come from the clash of world views, debates and simply seeing how people who are different react and interact with stuff.

Also I think the house/new schools traits are kinda super focused with no space for people slightly (or a lot) out of the curve.

All that said, it is a great prompt. I never saw anything like it before and would read a fic with it
