Hogwarts could host the 1st years only maybe and the department of education where all first years are assessed, given rankings in various classes/skill sets and then they are approached by the schools at the end of the year. Given tests etc. It also is the only place examinations may be taken, inter school sports games take place, and perhaps acts as a university for graduates?

Dumbledore would be head of department of education (aka first years + university) and check in regularly with each school later. He'd develop a relationship with Harry perhaps when teaching him transfiguration in first year.

Harry would be one of the very few who are offered a position at all four schools.

Schools may take as many or as few students as they wish. Slytherin takes fewest students followed by Ravenclaw. Majority go to Gryffindor and Hufflepuff.

Slytherin- mainly pure blood or the ultra talented/ambitious, small amount of half bloods Ravenclaw- top in various rankings or highly rated all rounders Gryffindor - anyone military minded, shows aggression, loves sports, or specialise in DDA Hufflepuff- takes the rest, actively recruits those who are influencers/social, good at sports, or show talent for Herbology and potions - they are connected to many mass production businesses

Inter house competitions are more expansive. Gobstones, debating, quidditch, and battle-school.

Harry goes to Gryffindor, but qualifies for a exchange program that allows top students to rotate certain schools (that they qualify for) once per year in order to promote unity (starting year 4 maybe?). Hermione qualifies Ravenclaw, Ron Hufflepuff, and Neville Slytherin. Different house do exchanges different terms
