If Hogwarts isn't being used as a school then perhaps its used as a sort of magical research facility. Its too big to be just used for sorting and competitions but I could see it as a ministry funded place that acts as a lesser department of mysteries. Also I could then see it as having an even more impressive library- containing a copy of everything that was produced by anyone that works there. This also gives more clear job prospects for students (other than work in the ministry) additionally it could be used for specialist training such as for healing.
