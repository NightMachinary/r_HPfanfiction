1 Hogwarts was able to stand strong because the people in charge all went to Hogwarts and respected the autonomous power of Hogwarts, a Hufflepuff Department head and a Ravenclaw Barrister don't care about Gryffindor Academy up in Ireland and it's autonomy. If anything bring it under heel is a good dig at the meat heads. Yes they lose the Autonomy of their school but they get fingers in 3 other "worst" schools

Essentially what kept Hogwarts out of Ministry power grabs was respect for the school and power of the defenses. These schools won't have this, without Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw and Slytherin and Gryffindor all blending their knowledge and influence.

2 the ministry wouldn't care about the hostility because they all grew up in the Hostility. But Britain can't look bad on a international scale, so while These schools all hate each other they need to provide a unified front so by essentially calling the schools and treating them as extensions of the Houses. Hogwarts isn't dead it's just grown beyond its walls

3 I would have Slytherin and Hufflepuff leave at around the same time, Slytherin because he didn't get his way (makes no sense that Ravenclaw and Gryffindor would give in to him) but Helga leaves as well because Godric and Rowena even debated letting Salazar get his way. Then you have the emotional head butting of Ravenclaw and Gryffindor about how to properly teach, through Military Precision or through Rote Memorization. The other founders leaving Hogwarts to Salazar is basically saying they where weaker than him but they kick him out and then break apart because of emotion and angry means no one wins which then makes the story "Let's all hate Slytherins" to "Our ancestors where fucking petty"
