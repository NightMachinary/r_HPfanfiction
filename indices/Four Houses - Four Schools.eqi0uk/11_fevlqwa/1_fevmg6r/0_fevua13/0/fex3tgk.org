I really do get your idea but I don't see the Ministry getting involved or even the public allowing the Ministry to get involved. The schools aren't state run establishments, as far as we know Hogwarts isn't a government funded school thus the Ministry doesn't really have the right to step in (hence why the whole Umbridge/Ministry interfering in Hogwarts thing was so massive).

Again, perhaps the Ministry could be getting more involved and trying to push the four schools together because of the negativity the school rivalries (on students and alumni) has on their society as a whole. They're seen as the bad guys for their interference with the schools and the system as a whole.

Additionally, why would Slytherin feel he is being lowered to the level of the four? He'd more likely feel victorious for actually managing to get Hogwarts all to himself. If he could see the modern era maybe he'd be upset but that's hundreds of years after he died.
