I agree and understand but my argument or take on the world purposed would be that the Government wouldn't exactly be happy with 4 schools existing in the same space and competing for the same students without some kind of firm hand guiding them to work and live together. Add in the lack of old wards and respect for each school (what does a Slytherin care about the autonomous capabilities of Gryffindor?) I see all four quickly falling under the purview of the ministry with Hogwarts being used as a figure head name. I would also just make a Slytherin School rather than hiding them behind the Hogwarts name since it would just legitimize Slytherin rather than lowering him to the level of the other 3.

As for the endgame rejoining, it could be that Voldemort leaders his Death Eaters through a long March knocking over the school's taking Loyal students while trying to cripple the resistance. The Final result is all the remaining Students showing up at Hogwarts and defending it from Voldemort one final time showing that together is better than apart
