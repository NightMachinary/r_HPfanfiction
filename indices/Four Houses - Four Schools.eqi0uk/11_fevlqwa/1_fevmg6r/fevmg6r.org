I had a somewhat similar idea a few months back. Post war, Hogwarts becomes the Hogwarts Trust, a collection of schools under the Hogwarts banner receiving training, aide and support from the main castle whilst operating in other parts of the country and the world.

I really like your idea, though mine stemmed from the fact that the Founders were never able to reconcile their differences of opinion and thus the British school system is as it is. A remnant of their past disagreement, if you will.

Perhaps this could be the endgame though? The story revolving, in some way, around the reintegration of the Founders vision into a single whole. Allowing the schools to share practices, staff and ideas and seeing they work better united than apart.
