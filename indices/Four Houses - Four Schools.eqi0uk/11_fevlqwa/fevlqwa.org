I would of "scrapped" Hogwarts or make it like the school's are forced under the banner by the government, like The Four Schools make up The Hogwarts Academies. All children that would be invited to Hogwarts are brought to Castle Hogwarts (a National Magical Landmark) for sorting by the legendary Sorting Hat. Then all Children would attend their own school for the year. They compete with each other in all manner of sport and academics (Arithmancy Bowl, Quidditch obviously, Broom Racing, Gobstones, Dueling, Transfiguration Challenges etc).

Voldemort's obsession with Hogwarts could then be built around the fact its position in England both binds and places Hogwarts before and above even the splintered schools. Dumbledore could be like the Superintendent of Hogwarts schools above even the headmasters. Hogwarts could be the constant home of the Triwizard Tournament as it's as close to a Neutral site as possible for all persons.
