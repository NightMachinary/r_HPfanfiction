Tom Riddle might not even exist, not as he is in canon. Merope never went to Hogwarts because her father kept it from her because he refused to use the Hogwarts Express. If Hogwarts is sole dominion of purebloods there's a real possibility that there won't be a Hogwarts Express, so Marvolo Gaunt won't keep his children from Hogwarts. And if word gets out that Merope is a parselmouth, then you can bet that regardless of her looks she'll be courted by more than a few wizards looking to add such a prestigious skill to thier bloodline. Same with Morfin too, I imagine.

Not to say she still won't fall for a certain village boy, but who knows.

Frankly all that sounds super interesting. Someone needs to get on this, because I wanna read it yesterday.
