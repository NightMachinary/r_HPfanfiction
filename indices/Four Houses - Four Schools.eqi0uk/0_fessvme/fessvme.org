If it's a free-for-all for students, and no neutral arbiter deciding who goes where, there's going to be an awful lot of students made miserable by being putput in the "wrong" school. Also, canon Hogwarts at least has contact and friendship between people of different houses. Which isn't going to happen here, there's just poisonous rivalry. Seven years of this may produced some quiet messed-up individuals.

So as an idea for a magical educational system, I think it's mad. But as a starting point for interesting stories, I think it's *utterly awesome*.
