I'm envisioning that it's like choosing a college/university -- students have ideas about where they want to go, schools know which students they're willing to take on as pupils (maybe by using a magical tool like the Sorting Hat), schools send out admission letters, and students pick which one they want to attend.

Yes, there are going to be students who make a decision that maybe wasn't the best for them in retrospect. But there are also students who end up in certain Hogwarts Houses when another one could have shaped them differently.
