"Mummy, I got accepted into Ravenclaw!" The girl with a thick sheet of parchment clutched in her hand and a huge grin on her face. A grin her mother tried to match as her heart launched up into her throat.

Her husband, a Ravenclaw himself, shot her a smug look before descending on their daughter with just as much enthusiasm. Smothering her in proud kisses and laughter.

3 years later she dropped out and completed her education at the Hufflepuff Academy. Just like her mother had had to do. That excited grin snuffed out on both of her beloved's faces after three years of hellish deadlines, massive overwork and truly TRULY cruel and indifferent staff and children.

In an equally cruel way, 'Mummy' was satisfied. Because at least NOW her husband would understand why she didn't want anymore of her babies setting foot in that hellish school.
