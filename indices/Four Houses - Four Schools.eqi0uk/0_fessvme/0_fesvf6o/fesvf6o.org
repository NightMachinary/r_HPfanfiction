My initial idea is that 'firsties' take the entire year to be Sorted. It is mandatory that they get some kind of tour of all four schools before having to decide at the end which one suits them best. The Sorting Hat's decision being more of a guideline on where it believes they should go.

E.g: the Weasley children were all recommended to go to the Gryffindor School but Percy was sent to the Ravenclaw Institute. And/or Harry IS sorted into Slytherin and advised to attend Hogwarts, but decides to go Gryffindor.*

But yes, it IS insane, all the House rivalries cranked up to eleven. Pure and glorious CHAOS!

*Can imagine this is a huge scandal, not only that the Boy Who Lived was a Slytherin at heart, but Hogwarts staff and students feeling snubbed when he decides not to go there. Making Harry somewhat unpopular on both sides.
