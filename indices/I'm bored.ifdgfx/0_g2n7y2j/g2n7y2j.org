Hmm. Long is easy, complete is not too hard. Pairings other than Hinny and Harmony are harder.

linkffn(The Arithmancer) has eventual Harry/Ginny in the background, but not as a focus; it's Hermione-centric, as specifically a maths whiz instead of a general bookworm (and she ends up with George). Book 1 is quite good, book 2 is a bit weak on plot but has quite interesting world building and exploration of what magic is capable of. Book 3 closes out the trilogy with the Statute of Secrecy becoming impossible to maintain in the face of ubiquitous video cameras and the internet, so magic is revealed to the world.

I quite like the Innocent series, but it's actively updating rather than complete, and the premise of Sirius raising Harry is hardly unique (although I like this one better than the others I've seen). Similarly, The Pureblood Pretense series is still in progress, book 4 last updated in June, and has a premise that looks ordinary but is actually a very original and creative story. Neither really has a pairing for Harry, although as of the latest chapters of Innocent, he's pretending to date Fleur in order to present a juicy story and distract Rita Skeeter from slandering Remus, and based on the crossover, there's a good chance that the Pureblood Pretense series will eventually pair Harriet with Leo.
