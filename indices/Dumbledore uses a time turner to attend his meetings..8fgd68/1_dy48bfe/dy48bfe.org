This reminds me of the fic where Harry confronts Dumbledore and Dumbledore manages to pull one off with brainwshing. Honestly. These type of fics are great because let's face it. Dumbledore is powerful. And cunning. He took out grindlewald. Held off Voldemort. Engineered Voldemorts final destruction and nearly mastered the Hollows. He's one of the most powerful wizards in HP Canon. I would love to see a long dumbledore fic where Harry tries this shit and Dumbledore wipes the floor with the little upstart.
