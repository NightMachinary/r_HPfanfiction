In the blue corner, Manipulative!Dumbledore, the old Headmaster of Hogwarts and Chief Warlock! He might be old but he's got magical longevity, and his only scheme of note seems to be to steal all of Harry's wealth (which seems to include owning half of magical Britain and 10% of the rest of the world)!

In the red corner, Independent!Harry, who's 11 years old but acts like an adult who hasn't recently re-read the books! Heeeee's out to level grind until he can pawn (wait, it's pronounced own) Voldemort and gather his harem with an eyebrow wiggle!
