What is "long distance" - are 20 meters "long distance"? 30? 40? a 100? (yes, meters, sorry - German, so metric...don't use feet (inches is ok because even Germans use that for screen-sizes (TVs, Computer-Screens, Mobile-Phones etc.))

I mean hitting something at a 100 meters is probably really hard (unless intent to hit really influences the spell!) because wands do not have a scope or something similar, so yeah duels are probably something that happens within a 20 meter radius in most cases!
