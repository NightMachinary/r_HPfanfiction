pitchers are incredibly well trained to do specifically that. Magicals aren't trained to point cast like that. You're comparing apples to oranges.

Have you ever seen them do anything beside point their wand, maybe give it a little twirl--which would change their original aim--at a point beyond about three or four meters? A wand is very much a weapon, even more so than it is a tool.
