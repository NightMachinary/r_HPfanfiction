How difficult is it to hit something with a basic "point and shoot" device? Judging by this article ([[http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2012/8/7/point-shooting/]]), effective point shooting range with a pistol is 10 to 15 yards. More than double that range seems to be reaching into "it's magic! It simply hits!" territory.
