I agree that non-area effect spells are likely difficult to aim more than about 15 yards away. If you're looking at 30 yards or more, and are assuming the spell hasn't dissipated into nothingness, you'll probably only hit someone if firing into a densely packed crowd or at a target who isn't aware of the incoming spell.
