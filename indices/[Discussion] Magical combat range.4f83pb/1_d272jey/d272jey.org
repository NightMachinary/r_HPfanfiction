It depends on the spell. Wands are obviously weapons but they aren't like guns that only fire a certain projectile.

Something like a stunner is probably equal to having a baseball pitched at you.

Some of the spells that Dumbledore and Voldemort dueled with could probably take out a city block if left unchecked. Fiendfyre was used by Crabbe who by all accounts was semi-powerful but neither intelligent or strong willed. It still destroyed The Room of Hidden Things.
