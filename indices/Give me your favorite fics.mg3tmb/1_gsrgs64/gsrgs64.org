Darkness visible by plutoplex

It is dark, intelligent, well written, touching, emotionally draining, cruel story to leave many in tears.

It is Snape centric, it gives an incredible in depth portrayal or him, many order members, Dumbledore and Grindelwald...

When l read this story it just hit me how all of the characters could very well be in canon written like that.

I am not sure if l could define it as Snape bashing story, as he does indeed do the worst things possible, probably the worst of all l have ever read so far. However this story helped me understand many of the characters and question all what Rowling wrote. It cemented my opinion of Severus Snape as my favorite /[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11625127/1/][darkness visible]]
