Yes, it was so unsettling. And even then he got no mercy or sympathy from the Order. I think only his death could redeem him in everyone's eyes. He was unworthy and inferior in every way to them, and he let them. Very sad and disappointing.

I strongly remember the time where he bleeds during Order meeting due to his injuries and Sirius Black insults him and complains about bloodstains on his carpets. That level of insensitivity astounds me.

Incredible and horrifying portrayal, especially because you would actually expect they would do and say such things.
