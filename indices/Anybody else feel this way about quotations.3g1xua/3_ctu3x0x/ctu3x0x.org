As everyone else said, it's a British-English thing, but as an Englishman I do actually agree with you. Not so much that I'll stop reading (though I can't recall often coming across it in fanfic), but I think double quotes look better--at least for speech. While it appears to be standard to use singles for quotes inside speech if you use doubles for speech itself (and vice versa), for quotes in the narrative people seem to use the same quotation mark that they use for speech. Personally, I prefer to use doubles for speech and singles for unspoken quotes; it helps differentiate between the two.
