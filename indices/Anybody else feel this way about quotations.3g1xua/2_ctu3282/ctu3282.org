From my understanding, the use of 'quote' instead of "quote" is simply a difference in region. British books use the first style, while American texts use the later.

If you are used to the American style it can be a tiny bit offputting to see the other style, so your feelings and opinions are valid ones, even if both ways of using quotes are technically correct.
