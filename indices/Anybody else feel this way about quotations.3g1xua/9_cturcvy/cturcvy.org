I use the doubles precisely because of this reaction, but I am also British so literally the only reason I don't do it in my fanfics is because Americans get annoyed and complain about it. Like, Americans will complain about the smallest language differences and I'm just like "w/e" so sometimes it's easier to just comply. I'll never go with 'Mom' though because it's ridiculous to hear a British person say, and 'trash can' or 'sidewalk'... these are just not words we use.
