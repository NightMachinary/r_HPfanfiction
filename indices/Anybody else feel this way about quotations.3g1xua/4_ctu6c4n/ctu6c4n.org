In Britain we're never officially taught but it's this: "[insert content here]" for speech and '[insert phrase here]' for quotation. Yeah, it's just a thing that happens. Monkey see, monkey do.

It's never made me stop reading to see that messed up, though I do get incredibly confused when someone has a literal paragraph of text using "[content]" for speech /and/ quotations.
