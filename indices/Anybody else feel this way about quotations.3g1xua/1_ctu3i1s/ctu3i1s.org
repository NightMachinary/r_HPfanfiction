Hate to break it to you, but that's British English. Surprised me the first time, too. You want proof? This my copy of Philosopher's Stone. I bought a beautiful set a few years back when I was studying abroad in England. One thing that also surprised me was the lack of a period after Mr. or Mrs. To be honest, you found a fanfic writer who is ACTUALLY British. Doesn't mean they are better at writing Harry Potter, but it does have a little bit more authenticity.
