I will totally admit the first two books are a bit slower than the rest of the series but once it gets going its amazing! Funny yet dark. I really love how its this huge fantasy world yet it stays logical regarding the way people would react to situations. The writer does a fantastic job of creating new cultures and a new form of magic. It has great character development over the whole series.

It won't be everyone's cup of tea but I thoroughly enjoy it
