1. No author should ask their readers to get through bad books to get to the better ones.

2. Throne of Glass is neither funny nor dark.

3. The world of the first book is a few rooms, a dungeon, a hallway, a ballroom and some trees.

4. Celaena doesn't react to situations like a hardened assassin probably would, she reacts like a spoiled princess.

5. First book features no character development for anyone.

The author claims she wrote a book about an assassin fighting for her life in Fantasy Hunger Games, but she didn't. It's fine to write a different book, but market it as what it is - fluffy romance with a few other things in the background.
