linkffn(Forging the Sword) is an excellent story where Harry is forced to make the decision to kill Ginny in the Chamber of Secrets. It has realistic, in character ways that every single character reacts to it, and I'd love more stories where one of the many traumatic events Harry goes through during his schooling actually triggers a desire to learn magic properly.
