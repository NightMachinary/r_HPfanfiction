I am very, /very/ glad that you elaborated on your title. I don't think that this particular subreddit would have been the appropriate place to share murder tips, unless it required meticulous horcrux removal.

As to your actual question, I point you tentatively to linkffn(Recnac Transfaerso), and, more particularly, linkffn(Alternate Ending to Recnac Transfaerso). It's very angsty stuff, of course, but it's the most memorable fic in the suicidal!Harry genre.
