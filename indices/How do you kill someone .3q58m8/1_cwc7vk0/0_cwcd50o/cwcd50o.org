Agreed - it's all about the reactions. I give time for the fallout, but I'm always aware of moments to pull the story back in. I fake-killed a major character [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory2.php?chapterid=486123&i=1][here]] in the height of a kidnapping rescue, but I think it would've been fairly similar even if it wasn't fake. It impacts each character - differently - but they're still in a life-or-death situation. And later I real-kill another character (end of chapter), which gets it own emotional fallout peppered through the rest of the story, but it was easier as it only directly affects one of the characters.
