Depends on the effect you want to achieve. Some deaths will be signaled to the reader far ahead of time so that when they finally happen, the emotional fall-out is already somewhat cushioned and doesn't impact the narrative as much.

Or a death can be a gut-punch, unexpected and explosive.

Or it can happen offstage, with the protagonist's reaction being the important point. (Maeglin Yedi, for instance, has Ron and Hermione die offscreen in "The Soul Adores," and Harry's muted response is a measure of how far Tom Riddle has come in corrupting him and changing his moral landscape.)

Or you can have deaths happen in quick succession, too fast for the emotional aftermath to sink in. JKR does this, actually, and I admit it's not my favorite technique, because it often feels as if the emotional complexity is scanted, and the deaths fall flatter than they ought to.

Or it can happen at the end, as the culmination of the character's destiny/plot arc/whatever. Which might mean we never get to see how it hurts or relieves or saddens the other characters, because the story ends once the MC is dead.

I'm not against melodrama on principle, btw. Sometimes scenery-chewing is exactly what you want, which potentially sets up the next scene to be retrospective or a total contrast or a numb silence in which you can practically hear the dust settling. It's up to the writer to control it.

(I may be biased, because I've written a very melodramatic death scene involving fake identities and wrong-headed vengeance, a potion-maddened son and suspicious circumstantial evidence, so it's all very overblown and high-pitched. If nothing else, I hope it's cathartic. The next section shifts immediately to the afterlife, so the story doesn't actually lose the MC (therefore undercutting the previous melodrama), and the mood changes as the story starts wrapping up its plot threads.)
