Sinistra is a hot red teacher who is idealistic about teaching. She is "the" hot teacher who sometimes wears a lil revealing(still PG and acceptable) clothes. She is everybody's crush, the only reason mediocre male and female students work hard to get into her class. Because she actually fails people frequently otherwise as it is an elective," don't pick it if you don't mean business pick divination instead"

Bathsheda is karolina zebrowska in her late 30s with bottlecap glasses and ankle skirts. Talks loudly, she is clumsy with a wand sometimes

Vector is a tall lanky brunette woman. Might rest on her elbow on Snape accidentally when drunk on one Christmas eve. Also has long straight hair. Maybe part asian, like female Keanu Reeves vibes with Mulan hair. Married to either a really young wizard or a really old wizard. She acts very professional most of the time and then be weird enough to have enough gossip material for a year, otherwise blends in the background once you get used to her height especially when Hagrid is in the room
