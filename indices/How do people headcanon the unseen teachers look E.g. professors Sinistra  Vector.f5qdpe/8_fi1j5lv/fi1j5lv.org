I always picture Vector as a crocodile with glasses because I was playing sonic heroes at the same time I was reading HP when I was a kid. This is what furry shit does to your brain.

The only mental image I have of Sinistra is that of a black woman with a pointy hat but I think that's because of the movies (She kinda went over my head when I first read the books).
