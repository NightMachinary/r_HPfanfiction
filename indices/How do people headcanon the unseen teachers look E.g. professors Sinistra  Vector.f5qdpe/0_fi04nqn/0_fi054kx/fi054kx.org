I'd add on for Kettleburn that he has one leg replaced by a wooden prosthesis and one arm missing, again replaced with a prosthesis that is charmed to move like a normal arm. If I wanna inject a bit of cool lore into the store, I'd have the wooden arm have a compartment for his wand that allows him to seemingly cast wandless magic.
