In my headcanon:

Spetima Vector is a young witch (25-30) that looks up to McGonagall and tries to be like her, thus has the same sternness and fairness to her.

Aurora Sinistra is a bit older witch (40) that is strict, but that's due to the fact that she gets tired spending the night teaching sleepy kids what stars are where and the meaning of each, while using the evenings to correct their assignments. Since she she has an inverted sleeping schedule, she is rarely seen at the head table unless during a feast.

Bathsheda Babbling is a very young witch (straigt outta runes mastery apprenticeship) which is fun, laid back and loves what she does. She appreciates students going above and beyond, and loves to help them achieve their goals.

Silvanus Kettleburn is a older wizard (nearing his 60's), and looks like a stockier Christopher Lee with more gray hairs and tons of scars. He is very knowledgeable, and loves magizoology, but doesn't quite have the same love for all animals as Hagrid.

Charity Burbage is a middle aged witch that knows jack shit about muggles and gives those that ask questions O's left and right just to keep quiet.
