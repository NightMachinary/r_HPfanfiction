Totally forgot Ancient Runes. In my headcanon Bathsheda is old and a little chubby, with small circular glasses like John Lennon's, and an array of magnifying tools that levitate. She wears lots of layers of robes and ties her grey hair under a headscarf like a fisher woman.

Burbage is younger and a little chubby as well. I imagine she dresses like Mrs Bucket which is funny because she's so much younger. Really age inappropriate clothes, but sometimes accidentally fashionable. She's relentlessly upbeat and cheery like a preschool teacher.

Sinistra wears turtlenecks and long open robes and was a Slytherin. Vector wears a lot of tweed and always forgets to iron any of their clothes.
