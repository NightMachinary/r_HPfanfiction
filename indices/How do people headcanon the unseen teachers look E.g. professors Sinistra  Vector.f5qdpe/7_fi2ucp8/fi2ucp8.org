Septima Vector: Tall, dark-haired pure-blood witch in her forties who is as strict and fair as McGonagall. Maybe even more for the latter since she isn't head of house. She was a Slytherin and was in the same year as Umbridge. They didn't talk much since they had diverging world views (the irony of their situation didn't fall on them what with a half-blood pro-purity and a pure-blood pro-equity). Septima got the role of prefect in her fifth-year and Umbridge was jealous and hated her for that.

Aurora Sinistra: Dark-skinned and dark-haired half-blood witch (mum's a witch, dad's a Muggle) in her late thirties, older than the Marauders. She's quite calm due to her inverted sleeping schedule, but nothing gets past her in the lessons. She also teaches her students about the advances the Muggles do in her subject, but she focuses on the the magical aspect of her class. That a man got on the moon is all fun and games, but that doesn't help her students understand the significance of the stars' alignment in potion-making.

Batsheda Babbling: She's younger than McGonagall but older than Vector. She's also on the strict side of things, but she can get quite passionate and joyful in her lessons. Particularly when the lessons delve in the practical side of the course. No one, not even Dumbledore, knows how it happened but both her and Trelawney are best friends. They weren't in the same year and their personality at first glance are very different, though they were both Ravenclaws. Guess opposites really attract each other.

Sylvanus Kettleburn: He's getting old, now, somewhere in his late eighties early nineties. He begun teaching his class the year the Chamber of Secrets opened, and from that moment his number of body parts only went down. First it was a finger, which rapidly became five. Fifteen years later, it was his leg. Then he lost a whole hand (the one with all his fingers) before he lost that arm seven years after. Between all that, he was able to get a scar on his face, but his eye was spared, unlike Moody. He really loved his job and taking care of interesting creatures, but sometimes he wished he had the strength and resistance of his friend Hagrid.

Charity Burbage: Dirty blonde, middle-aged pure-blood witch a bit like Arthur Weasley in that she loved everything Muggle but didn't really understand it. She's convinced that Muggles are more advanced concerning social issues compared to wizards despite it being the contrary and commends the Muggles for having lived well and their swift advances in the last century and a half without magic.
