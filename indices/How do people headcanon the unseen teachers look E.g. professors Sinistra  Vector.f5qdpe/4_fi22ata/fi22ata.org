Bathsheda Babbling has recently solidified herself into a tall, elegant, West-African woman who wears a lot of beautiful, colourful, silk head scarves.

Aurora Sinestra has always been Mediterranean or Latina - olive skin, long dark hair. A little curvier than more Northern Europeans.

Kettleburn I usually imagine as quite a gaunt-looking man. In my head he's usually from Northern England; probably York or somewhere like that. Oddly, I always think of him as quite short, but I think that's in comparison to Hagrid, who tends to be a lot taller in my head than he was in the films. While I think of him as a short man, I usually put Kettleburn only a little shorter than Minerva McGonagall who I think is quite tall, in addition to wearing well-heeled boots.

Charity Burbage is always a short, dumpy blond woman in cardigans; sort of like Umbridge, but much nicer and not all pink and always ready with a smile.
