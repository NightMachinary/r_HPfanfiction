bellerophon30's story /The Brave New World/ from the mid 2000s is the first that comes to mind. In the summer after 5th year Harry decides to leave Great Britain to go overseas and attend a magical school in the US.

In my memory it stands out as one of my favorites in the 'Harry attends a different school' category, but I also haven't read it in several years so I'm unsure how well it has aged and how much my tastes have developed since then.

It was originally posted on FF.net but the author pulled it a few years ago. Now it's available as a copy in several places [[https://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/harry_ginny/bnw/a/0/The+Brave+New+World/bellerophon30/40][like this one]].
