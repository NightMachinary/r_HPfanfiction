While I fully understand the idea here, and I find it delightful, it just doesn't make much sense to me.

It's all down to some basic logic. Harry's mother Lilly is a redhead with vibrant green eyes, these are fairly ressesive traits in the grand scheme of things and therefore make it unlikely that Harry would get dark skin from his mother's side. Harry's father James is a british pureblood with several distinct physical characteristics. As far as the British pureblood bit goes, most of the British pureblood population is mostly Caucasian. Not only that, but Harry's other distinctive feature of his father's hair is described as black and messy, but never particularly curly. While having straight, albeit very messy hair, does not really mean much in the way of indicating genetic or ethnic heritage. The pureblood part does. The potters were an established fixture in Britain. They were related to the majority of the pureblood families in some way or another, thus making the common genetic trends among the other purebloods a good indicator for Harry and James appearance. And while it is certainly possible for James to not be fully Caucasian like most pureblodd, the likely heritage of Lilly combined with the fact that Harry does inherit down of Lilly's traits means they have not been genetically drowned out.

As I said, I quite like the idea of a darker skinned Harry, I just can't see it making sense for this to be the case.
