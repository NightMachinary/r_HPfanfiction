First of all, it's fan fiction; the entire point is to change things. Lily's hair and eyes are distinctive but hardly essential to the plot, and it would be trivial to change her appearance.

Second of all, even if you want to avoid that sort of change for whatever reason, your argument about the Potters is flimsy. Of the pureblood families we only see the Weasleys and the Blacks in any significant quantity. Dorea Black married into the Potter family but has no established blood relation to James, and the Weasleys have no known relation to the Potters aside from their own link to the Blacks. That covers two of the /twenty-eight/ families known for being /fully/ pure-blooded, which the Potters aren't. It's entirely possible that there is significantly more racial variation in Wizarding society than Muggle society.

As others have mentioned, there are even some specific highly plausible possibilities leading to a non-white Potter family. Britain has had close ties to India since before the stated establishment of the Statute of Secrecy, and if we accept the heavily hinted Roman influence in magical society (through naming, the use of Latin, and prevalence of Arthurian mythology---one of the most frequently mentioned candidates for influencing the Merlin legend was a Roman general) along with the increased ease of long-distance travel using magic it seems quite likely that prominent families could come from any part of the Roman Empire. Egypt, in particular, is a popular choice for having a large amount of influence in magical history, is specifically mentioned in canon, is implied to have a relatively close relationship with Britain given Bill Weasley's occupation, and has a large non-white population.

Being confident in the impossibility of a non-white Harry is a sign of internal biases more than anything. JKR gives very little concrete information about the magical world.
