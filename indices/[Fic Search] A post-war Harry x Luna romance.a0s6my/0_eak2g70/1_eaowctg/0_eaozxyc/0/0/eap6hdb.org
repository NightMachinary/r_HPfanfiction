I actually have the opposite reaction. Rather, I love them, but the endings are so so so bad that I can't help but hate them. The only one I didn't read was the one where Voldemort is a chick. So I don't know about that, but the rest? Every ending could've been way way better, its like his brain freezes 3 chapters before the end. The only one that I haven't felt like that is the one with Luna.
