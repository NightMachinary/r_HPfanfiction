I remember one story I read had Harry visiting Hermione in London when the Dementor attack happened. Only it still happened in Little Whinging. Dudley got his soul sucked out. And he still got a notification of being expelled for casting a patronus charm, despite being nowhere near the area and not knowing how to cast the charm.
