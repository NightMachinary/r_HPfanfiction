Yeah. I was just thinking about how I wanted Harry who embodied malicious compliance so much that it just changes how he acts and reacts and I realized it was pretty cracky. I wanted a long, oneshot fic with humor and petty revenge in abundance within.

Typically, if it's an AU, then those defining moments of canon will usually change in some way even if you still use the basic outline of the scene itself. This was done as a way to show how inept Fudge is because he and Harry are in a somewhat silent war against each other's reputations, but I wanted to do it in a funny way. It started lightly with Sirius being freed when Harry called him out for Sirius and Hagrid's wrongful imprisonment, and then further wrongful imprisonment that made him look even worse, and then it evolved into trying to ruin each other in petty ways.
