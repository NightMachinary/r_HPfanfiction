It was acknowledged as a very clumsy attempt to silence Harry Potter that ended up making Fudge look even more idiotic than normal, when he /still/ tried him in front of the full Wizengamot. While it /is/ a "Stations-of-Canon," the stupidity is easily attributed to the characters, rather than the writer, IMO.

The whole fanfic is a somewhat long oneshot, and more than a little cracky, but it's mostly played for laughs.
