It's popular because it's a Harry/OC pairing without the stigma of using a blatently original character.

Grow Young with Me is a good option if you want an OC pairing in an epilogue compliant story. It's a fluffy/angsty romance with bonus Parent!Harry and has a fairly well done OC. Surprised it isn't here yet, I'm sure it's somebody's GOAT fic lol. linkao3(16405130)
