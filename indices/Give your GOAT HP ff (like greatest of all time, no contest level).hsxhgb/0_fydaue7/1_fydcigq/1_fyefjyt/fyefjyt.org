Don't bother with Novocaine. It's awful.

In our world, Novocaine is a drug designed to nullify our senses in times of extreme pain, and to be fair it does the job of nullifying your senses perfectly. It's a grey walk through the wizarding world from one boring place where Harry throws money at things to another boring place where Harry throws more money at things.

It's the literary equivalent of one of those awful musicals where the lead character solves all the village's problems and ends up at the apex of a triangle of grateful people following him (and it's almost always a him) down the street.

Steer well clear.
