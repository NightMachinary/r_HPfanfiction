I've said it before and I'll say it again: linkffn(Vitam Paramus) is my favourite story.

It's so sad that it often gets called a Harry Potter/Gabrielle Delacour romance because that simplifies things far too much. Saying that it's a story about two people saving each other gets closer. But really, just read it for yourself.

It might not be [[/u/TE7]]'s "best" story in terms of writing and depth of plot but it stays with me as a story I read time and time again and it never loses its edge.
