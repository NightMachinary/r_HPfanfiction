MILD SPOILERS - You obviously didn't read the post description. I find Cadmean victory way too long firstly with a lot of unnecessary bs put in there for the sake of it. More than that, I find that Harry's character is so fundamentally changed in that fic that it might as well be an OC. The Hermione Ron Snape and especially Dumbeldore bashing is too much for me and I just feel that Harry's choices that revolve around the whole I do not forgive I do not forget shit are all so OOC. Ik that fans will say that this is because he was going through emo teen shit and had a horcrux in him but he still did kill Dumbeldore in one of the last chapters. That fic almost made me hate HP FF just because of how convoluted and bad it is.
