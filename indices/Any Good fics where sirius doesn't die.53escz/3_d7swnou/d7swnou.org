It is my headcanon that he didn't actually die when he fell behind the Veil, but rather fell into a sort of liminal state - Limbo if you like - neither dead nor alive, because the final separation of corporeal body and soul could not occur. The Veil is a mysterious thing, not very plausibly explained and I like to see a body before I believe someone is dead.

I did use this premise in a story, but I doubt it is what you are looking for.
