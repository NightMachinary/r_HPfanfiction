Harry has a new familiar, a grim, so technically a dog with the added bonus it has magical abilities to help him.

Warning: the fic is rather poorly written and so fluffly at times, I had to skip ahead. Dialogues felt rather stiff, too, and characters OOC.

But it fits your request, so read at your own risk.
