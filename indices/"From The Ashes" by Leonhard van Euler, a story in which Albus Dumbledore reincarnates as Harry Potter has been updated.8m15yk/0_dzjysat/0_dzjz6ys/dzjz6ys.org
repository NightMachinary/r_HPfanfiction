I can't remember the name, but there was one where, after dying, Dumbledore wakes up in Harry Potter's body during the summer between his fifth and sixth years. It quickly jumps into the action, having Dumbledore decide that the "Seven Potters" plan puts people in too much undue danger. Something with Runes and Bill Weasley to hold off Death Eaters or something.

Sorry I can't remember more.
