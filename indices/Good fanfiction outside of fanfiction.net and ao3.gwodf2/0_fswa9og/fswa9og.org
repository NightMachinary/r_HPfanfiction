There is the [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com][www.hpfanficarchive.com]] site it hosts both original work as well as copies of certain authors work.

For instance I like Raolin's The Fires of Magic as it gives an interesting twist with harry learning a different style of magic. And it's available on both FFN and hpfanficarchive.

Now RotaryFile who goes by Selector on FFN has his Witches Secret Trilogy on both sites. But his Our Lady O'the Bless'd Do Over series is only available on hpfanficarchive.
