It may have been described in the dementor swarm scene, or the train scene, but I'm not sure. I do know that they have some sort of face in the books.

The movies are also canon, and they of course show their faces in grotesque detail. The wiki describes it like this:

/"A Dementor's face has empty eye sockets, covered with scabbed skin. There is a gaping large hole where the mouth should be, which is used for sucking the soul out of the victim in a process called the Dementor's Kiss"/
