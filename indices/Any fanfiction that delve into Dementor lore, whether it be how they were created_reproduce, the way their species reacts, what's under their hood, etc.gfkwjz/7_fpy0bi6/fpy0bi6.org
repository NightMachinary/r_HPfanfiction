DEFINITELY THIS FIC

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9097983/1/Without-Thorn-the-Rose]]

Its a very bittersweet tale where Harry has an almost connection to dementors and his search for answers (up close with them). It really delves into dementor lore as you want! I just re read this a few days ago, still as compelling as I remembered.
