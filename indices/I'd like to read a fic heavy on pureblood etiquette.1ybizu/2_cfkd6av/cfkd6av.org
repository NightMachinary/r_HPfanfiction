Going offtopic: Spellcaster annoyed me. The ideas are great, but Snape is pathetic there (and by extension, his use as the reason pureblood etiquette deserves any respect fails). I'd say it is about why Hermione is ten times the witch Snape is a wizard. It's not badly written, I'll give the story that.
