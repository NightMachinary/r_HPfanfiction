Came to recommend this series, (first story is "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]]") as I'm currently re-reading it.

While I agree its drastically AU, I'd say the characters are just variations, how they would be changed in a world as detailed as this one. Different, but not unrecognizable. And where they end up the most OOC is in the final few books, where the prior years of change and hardship has made all the difference.

I had put it off for a long time because it is a "Harry isn't the boy-who-lived" story, which seems so... AU to be not worth it, but the series was so complicated and detailed and fleshed out that you don't feel like it's a "so harry's twin is the BWL and is the best at everything, so harry has to beat him at everything miraculously and then he takes on Voldemort single handed and everyone is happy, the end" which so many of these types of stories become.

You will want to shake Harry by the end of the first story, but you aren't the only one (several characters that befriend Harry share the sentiment).

It truly is an epic and the etiquette, both light and dark, human and otherwise, are well thought out and brilliantly detailed.

Edit: Typos, because something posted at midnight must have them. :P
