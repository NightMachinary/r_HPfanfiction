Awakening Power: linkffn(1709027)

The two events are mostly unconnected, but Harry does indeed grow more powerful and more mature in a sense, and the story takes place after Sirius's death.

Taking Control: linkffn(2954601)

Indy!Harry warning, but the Ghost of Sirius'es Past visits Harry and starts him training in this one, as well as urging Harry to be more proactive in certain things. I /think/ there's a completed sequel on SIYE somewhere but I'm not sure.
