I'm currently writing a story, and once I get to the Third Task, the simplest trick is used. You know, the maze is in the Quidditch pitch for over a month with anyone free to study it. So, obviously, a certain Triwizard Champion flies on a broomstick over the maze, takes some parchment and a quill, and draws the layout of the maze. Then he studies the drawing and memorizes the shortest way to the centre.
