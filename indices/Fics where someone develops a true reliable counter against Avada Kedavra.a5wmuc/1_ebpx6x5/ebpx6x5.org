Hmm...I remember a fanfic which had the portraits of the Founders of Hogwarts found, they commented on the hexing going on in the halls and how 'we were teaching a bunch of teenagers, did you think we /wouldn't/ put up wards to reflect spells between classes?', and how those wards had apparently been disabled by a previous headmaster for whatever reason. A part of that scene had Salazar Slytherin's portrait commenting that the Killing Curse's spell matrix could easily be disrupted by the simple Lumos charm.

Hmm...but where was it?
