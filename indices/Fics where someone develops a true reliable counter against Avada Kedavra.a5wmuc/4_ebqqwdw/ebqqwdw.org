You can easily do it with canon magic. Here's how: Hagrid made a brick wall conjure up with a push of a button on his motorcycle. So make a charmed watch that makes a brick wall in front of you whenever you press a button on the side of it. Simple, easy, done!

Instant Killing Curse blockage. Entirely in canon. Just touch your watch in a duel and you're good. Just need actual brain smarts to charm the watch, but considering the wall button was added by Arthur he can do it to a watch easily enough too. There are loads of people more talented and powerful than him, so they'd be able to do it too. Mass produce them. Killing Curse Block Watches.
