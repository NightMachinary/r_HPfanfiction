Conjured objects are real. Conjured metal is metal, a conjured animal has blood and veins and complex organs and a brain. It's solid matter and mass. Therefore it blocks things that hit it. You don't need to "shrink and hide a wall in a dimension space" or anything else. Your headcanon is just needless sidestepping because you don't want to believe the "all powerful killing curse" is actually not so all powerful. And that's on Rowling. But you don't need to literally make stuff up to justify Rowling's shitty worldbuilding skills.

The death curse just isn't that much of a threat if you apply even a bit of intelligence in how you utilize the magic system she has, and that's okay.
