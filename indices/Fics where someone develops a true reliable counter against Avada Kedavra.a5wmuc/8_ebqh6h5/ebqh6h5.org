There was a one shot where Harry realizes that his parents cast the killing curse around him constantly, even though it was not at him, in an attempt to experiment and make themselves "immune." There's also a oneshot where Harry goes back and creates the Killing Curse in time, because the creator can apparently not be affected by a spell he creates.
