Well, canon shows Dumbledore blocking it with solid objects.

For an actual counterspell, there's the controversial but thought-provoking linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality). YMMV greatly; many people adore it, many others can't stand it (usually because Harry is frequently arrogant and abrasive, or due to the lectures on rational thinking interspersed with the plot). I do recommend trying it to see for yourself what you think, because it's complete, intricate, has lots of humor, very few typos, and an impressive antagonist.
