Well, there is the [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169NVDxmtgDuwB7O1rZenT_WfKWTJqs-k-cdxd37xHWw/edit][100 Most Recommended Fics]] on this sub.

It's characterized by:

- Adventure over romance. The highest ranked romance centric fic, "Grow Young With Me", comes in at #34.
- Canon pairings and canon compliant fics are not favored. Disregarding "Seventh Horcrux", the highest ranked fic with canon pairings is "Divided and Entwined" at #13. The highest canon compliant fic is "Strangers at Drakeshaugh" at #37.
- Ruthless protagonists who compile a large body count are preferred. The main characters of ALL top ten recommended fics could be considered either 'gray' or 'dark'.
- "A Black Comedy" and "Delenda Est" have been among top ten since 2014.
- I don't think there is a single Dramione or Drarry fic on that list.
- Slash fics are not popular. The highest male slash fic I can identify is "Again and Again" at #86.
