Thanks for the reply. I was on/off in the community so for me it seems like a stark change which makes getting back a little daunting.

Unlike back in my high school/college years I think I know find more time as I have a 1.5 hour commute each way every morning. I've been able to consume the longer stories because of the read audio feature.

I think also with PotterMore and fanwikis it gives better access to data. It has been a lot easier to build worlds based on the books. Also, I feel that since more is known I have to research to ensure things are plausible.
