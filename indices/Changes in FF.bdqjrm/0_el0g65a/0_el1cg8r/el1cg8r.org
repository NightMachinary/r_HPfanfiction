  the quality of writing seems to have increased was well as the age of writers

it's probably a little bit of both. but right now, harry potter isn't really attracting younger people. I would assume that most of the people writing/reading fanfiction now are the ones who were reading/writing it when deathly hallows or the last movie came out. so it's possible those people have gotten better at writing. and probably the older you are, the better at writing you're going to be as you have a larger vocabulary and more knowledge.
