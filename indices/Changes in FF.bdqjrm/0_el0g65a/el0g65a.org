What a great question.

I started reading / writing fan fiction in 2005ish. I stoped publishing in 2008 and stoped avidly reading in 2010. I started publishing and reading again last year (which has been the best decision I've made in a long time).

Prior to DH a lot of stories were about the final battle and much longer. People were writing novel length stories about what was going to happen. In contrast most of the newer things I read are less than 15,000.

Back in the day there were so many different types of stories. Poems, song fics, art accompanying, drabbles etc. I see a lot less fan art in general. Maybe it's just the sites I use now. Idk.

Communities were based in ships. It was so easy to join a group of like minded people and all have the same opinion about what should happen. Now the community is much much smaller and general. On this site I see much more diverse opinions (about ships, character opinions, plot opinions)

Re entering the fandom, the quality of writing seems to have increased was well as the age of writers. I don't know if it's just that I'm just more selective about what I choose to read, if the types of stories I read now attract stronger writers or if there's just been an increase in quality.

A lot of stories today deal with mental health.

I see a lot less Hermione/everyone. Hermione seems to be liked a lot less in general. Also (aside from Drarry) a lot less Draco.

Slash is just as decisive as ever.

These trends may all simply be the result of my age changing and the sites / interests I had then in contrast to the media I consume now. All that being said I think the fandom really has matured and those who write are in general older and we aren't gaining as many younger folk.
