to nipick a bit,

Unless my math is wrong (possible) he wouldn't have turned 18 until December 31, 1944. So the absolute earliest he could have been drafted would be January of 1945.

However, he is still a student during that time and students were, I believe, exempt. So given that he doesn't graduate until May/June of 1945 he couldn't technically be drafted And by that point the war in Europe is over.

While conscription continued past the end of the war, it seems like a wizard would be able to avoid that quite easily. Even if just showing up with your arm disillusioned and being like 'so yeah I don't have arms'.

More historically, he'd be more likely to be 'drafted' into the Korean war than WW2. And a lot of that would depend on how long you think he's putzing around with Borgin and Burke.

It'd be very hard to come up with a legit reason for him to actually have any interest in going into the service and not just ignoring it entirely and oblivating/killing whomever showed up to try to collect him.

That being said, there is probably an interesting fic to be written around like Tom Riddle and the Battle of the Imjin River.
