Wartime conscription rolled straight over into National Service - which didn't end until 1960. Riddle fell into the awkward period between the end of the War and the National Service Act 1948, which mandated peacetime conscription - 2 years in uniform and 4 years reserve service. He would have been liable to register on his 18th birthday and would have been called up for at least basic training if he had actually done so. He would have been a reservist at the time of the Korean war, and almost certainly wouldn't have been mobilised.

It basically depends on him being registered for conscription, which he could have been prosecuted for not doing. Not that they'd be able to actually catch him, or would be trying terribly hard after VE day. One dodger more or less in jail wouldn't be huge priority, they largely depended on picking them up for something else: since demobilised veterans were taking all the honest jobs, conscription dodgers gravitated to petty crime.

Edit to add: Even if he had been called up for Korea, he wouldn't have been an infantryman at Imjin River. As a london boy, he wasn't from any of the recruiting areas for the infantry regiments present. There were tanks, artillery and engineers, though, although I'm not sure they were taking conscripts by that point. The Glosters definitely had some, but they'd all , or at least mostly, be west country lads.
