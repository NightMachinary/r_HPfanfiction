  Don't you have a couple Royal Brigades and Regiments though?

Regiments and Corps. They're parts of the Army, not the army itself, and some of them can trace their lineage back before the New Model Army.

Explaining the intricacies of how defence spending, defence cuts, military doctrine, the exigencies of empire and several centuries of tradition born out of the settlement of a three-cornered civil war interact to produce the current confusion is more than one can do in a comment. Just remember that Bill Bryson quote to the effect that the first requirement of any British institution is that it be utterly incomprehensible to foreigners.

The pre-1914 professional army didn't die in the trenches: there were regulars throughout the war and right through the conscription years. The trick was to volunteer before you were called up so you could join your service of choice and, if you went for the army, your regiment of choice.

(And the marines aren't a separate service, they're part of the Royal Navy, first formed as The Duke of York and Albany's Maritime Regiment Of Foot, then IIRC unofficially renamed the Admiral's Regiment, they didn't get called Marines until the mid 18th century, when they came under Admiraty control)
