The best written Slytherin!Harry I've read is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) It also just so happens to be my favorite Harry Potter fanfiction to date. It's a WBWL fic that subverts a lot of common tropes in that genre. It makes an effort to make everyone smarter, not just Harry. It's nearing the end of the third book now and is being updated at a semi-regular basis. Highly recommended, I hope you enjoy.
