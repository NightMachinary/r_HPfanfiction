Yeah, they were bound to the castle/Headmaster; of course elves are fierce in defense of their masters, we saw that with Winky and even Kreacher.

They were fighting for their masters, not for some abstract concept.

In the case you presented, their allegiance would have been to the castle or Headmaster.

And might I remind you that these same Hogwarts elves you are talking about are the ones that looked down on Winky for being derelict in her duty as an elf, and on Dobby for his being a "free" elf?

My point is, if the elves fought in and war, it would be at the behest of someone else, not independently.

And such a war would be ultimately disastrous for the elvish population: it would devastate their population for what is essentially a massive virtue signal, they'd die and suffer for what humans /think/ they /should/ want.
