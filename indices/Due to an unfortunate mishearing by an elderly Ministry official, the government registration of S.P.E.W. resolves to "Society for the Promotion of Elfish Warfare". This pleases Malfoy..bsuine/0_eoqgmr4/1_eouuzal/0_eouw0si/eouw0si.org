Have you forgotten how fiercely the Hogwarts Elve fought in the Battle of Hogwarts, once Kreacher roused them? Obedient doesn't mean meek. The only reason the Death Eaters didn't employ Elvish soldiers is bigotry; they utter obedience, which doesn't prevent them from being aggressive if asked to do so, would make them ideal soldiers.
