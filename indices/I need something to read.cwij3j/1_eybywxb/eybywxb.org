- linkffn(11910994) it is very well written, but there is too much fighting (perfectly well done) for me and the basic story seems weak and too slow. However, if you are into fighting, you should like this.
- linkffn(12155794) the final battle is really great and there is very rare (AFAIK) look into the Grindewald's war.
