I haven't read the fic in your post, so I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for, but this fic has a friendly relationship between Harry and Dumbledore:

Basically, after CoS, Harry is expelled and Dumbledore didn't get back his post as Headmaster. So Dumbledore becomes Harry's private tutor and they go out and see the world and learn some magic. Their relationship is hilarious, Dumbledore is very socratic and wants Harry to figure things out on his own. Plus a bunch of other fun stuff, like Dumbledore owning a bowling alley called Lord Bowl-Some-More. Highly recommended!
