They shouldn't be short humans. That to me is really important. They shouldn't have the same aims and goals. They don't have to have the same values. We know they rebel but we don't know why. Some people will say that they are oppressed but what if they just have a natural bloodlust? What if they have long lives and rebellions are their way of population control? Why do they have to hate humans to want to kill them, to have the rebellions?
