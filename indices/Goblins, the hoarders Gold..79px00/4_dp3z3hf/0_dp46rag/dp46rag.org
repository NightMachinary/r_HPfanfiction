  Some people will say that they are oppressed but what if they just have a natural bloodlust? What if they have long lives and rebellions are their way of population control?

Both options, while interesting in a /Twillight Zone/ kind of way, are, I think, way too dark for the Potterverse. An entire species of sapient, feeling beings who are just evil at birth is just... an /extremely/ dark and depressing concept that, to me, doesn't fit the series at all.
