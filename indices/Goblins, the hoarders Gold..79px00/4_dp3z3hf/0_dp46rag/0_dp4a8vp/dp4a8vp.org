I think that depends entirely on how the author handles it. Having the urges doesn't mean that they have to act on them but it might explain their hostility. The whole Potterverse is twisted and dark beneath a layer of whimsical. The Minister has the power to make people disappear off to Azakaban because they want to appear to be doing something. Sirius didn't get a trial. Harry was tortured by a person high up in the Ministry. The most popular sport involves smashing leather clad balls of iron at each other. They set up kids fighting dragons as a spectacle of entertainment and had them somehow compelled to compete no matter what. Every single one of them carries a tool that is capable of destruction. Your identity can be stolen with a few hairs or drops of blood. Your deceased family's bodies can be raised from the dead by a dark wizard and made to maul you apart. If you look, the Potterverse is terrifying.
