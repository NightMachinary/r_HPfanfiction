Doing anything for gold, and hating everyone at the same time. Goblins are conniving, evil little bastards that seek only to profit wherever and however they can, using technicalities and loopholes in arrangements to screw everyone out of money just because they can.

I want goblins to be portrayed like this more often, rather than the blood-testing, god-tier-investing, heirloom-retrieving, basilisk-harvesting simpletons who immediately follow the protagonist's every whim because they were polite once. I'm sick of goblins being given pivotal roles in driving the early sections of many plots forward through acting as the wizarding world's only solicitors, notaries, registry office, estate managers and whatever-the-fucks rather than just creatures that hold money and make weapons/jewellery.

By all means, they don't have to be pushovers - I like it when goblins get a bit violent, but I want them to be more than just cardboard cut-outs for the protagonist to use for help.

Otherwise, I don't want them in the story at all.
