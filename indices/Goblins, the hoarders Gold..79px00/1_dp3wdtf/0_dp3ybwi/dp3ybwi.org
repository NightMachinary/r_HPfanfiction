While I agree that they shouldn't be a one-way trip to OPness just because someone is polite to them (I mocked the idea in /Parselmouth of Gryffindor/), I take issue with the idea of lumping them all together as "evil little bastards". The idea veers dangerously close to racism in my view, and I feel like what you describe in the first paragraph is how people like Malfoy perceive them, rather than a fair description of who they are.

Do they act this way in front of wizards? /Yes/. The banktellers of Gringotts find wizards annoying and, because of the hundreds of years of war between British Goblins and Wizardkind, they aren't inclined to show a kinder side. But I don't think it's at all a good idea to portray them as inherently villainous --- it's all a cultural thing, and I'm sure they don't act that way towards one another.
