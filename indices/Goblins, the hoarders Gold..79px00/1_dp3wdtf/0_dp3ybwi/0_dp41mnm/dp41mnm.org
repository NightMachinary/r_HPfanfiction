I also think Flitwick is evidence of not all of them being evil little bastards. We don't really know his backstory, but it points to the fact that all goblins aren't inherently evil. If they were, would he not be as well? That's not to say they can't be confrontational and greedy, just that it's not an inherent part of their genetics.
