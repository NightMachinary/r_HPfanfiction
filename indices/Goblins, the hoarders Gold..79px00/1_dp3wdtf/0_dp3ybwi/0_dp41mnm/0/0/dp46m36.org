  I don't want their dislike explained, or given legitimate cause, or anything like that.

While "given legitimate cause" has arguments both for or against, I believe not /explaining/ their dislike of wizards, while simultaneously not holding that they are genetically evil, would just be poor worldbuilding. Every villain who wasn't born a psychopathic sadist has a /reason/ for what they do. That reason may not be based in /sound logic/, but it's a reason.

The Death Eaters don't go after muggleborns just 'cuz --- they go after muggleborns based on their erroneous belief that muggle-borns pollute their bloodlines, and also more subconsciously to reassure themselves and give themselves back the power they feel to be their birthright, in a society that listens to them less and less. This is a perfect example of /explaining/ an antagonistic group's dislike without giving it at all legimitate cause.

In Goblins' case, going per canon, their antagonism against wizards seems mostly rooted in how wizards denied them the ownership of wands, combined with their general status as second-rate citizens (at least in Britain). For all we know, maybe wizards were only forced to resort to such measures because Goblins were a menace /first/, but clearly, to the /modern/ goblin's mind, those are the perfectly legitimate reasons why they should screw humans over at every possible opportunity.
