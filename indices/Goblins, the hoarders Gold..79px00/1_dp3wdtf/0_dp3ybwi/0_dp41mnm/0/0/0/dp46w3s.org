You've made an eloquent argument, and yet I have no interest whatsoever in finding out what grievances the goblins have against wizards. I am happy to assume that they hate wizards /just because/, or for reasons that don't need explaining.

If the story were /about/ that conflict between wizards and goblins, or they played a pivotal role in the plot, then by all means, such things should be explained and in such a case I actually agree with you, as it makes for better storytelling to have motivations and reasoning behind characters' actions.

However, if these are just goblins featuring in a story that has little or nothing to do with them apart from background mentions, then I don't feel that anything is gained by world building here.
