Well if it's not important, it probably shouldn't be mentioned, interesting or no. I've never really enjoyed worldbuilding where it's not relevant, and unless the goblins are important to the story, I feel like they're best just left in the background, a constant fact - the sky is blue, and goblins run Gringotts, which ostensibly handles all of the wizard money.
