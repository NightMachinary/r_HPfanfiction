I'm not saying they're /genetically/ evil, they just /are/. They appear to despise all wizards, and happily go to screw them over whenever they like for personal gain. I don't want their dislike explained, or given legitimate cause, or anything like that. I just don't want goblins to be nice and helpful. Neutral or worse is best, I think.
