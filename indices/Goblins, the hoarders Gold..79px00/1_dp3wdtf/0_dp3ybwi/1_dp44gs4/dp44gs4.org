The problem is that every example of a goblin that's presented in canon, including the background ones like the debtors who are after Ludo Bagman in /Goblet of Fire/, are /all/ conniving, evil, money-minded monsters.

People like to espouse goblin values but in canon, they have only two - make money, and viciously protect said money.

Unless the portrayal of goblins is important to a story, I prefer them to remain thoroughly as a footnote. If it /is/ important, I stand by what I said, in that I most definitely prefer a close-to-canon portrayal of the goblins, in that they really don't like or care for wizards save for making them money or obtaining valuable artefacts, and have the potential to be vicious little buggers if they need to be.

In truth, I'm really just sick of the nice!Goblins trope, and am only happy with goblins being portrayed as neutral or worse from there.
