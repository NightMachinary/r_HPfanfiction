Well, I don't know about you but I'm not really interested in seeing a goblin-centric fic, original that idea might be. So from a wizard's perspective, and in how the goblins deal with wizards, they're conniving little bastards.

Although that principle is cool, the goblins use that rule to take stuff 'back' from wizards. The ownership rules are never seen used for any other purpose than taking things that they /believe/ belong to them, regardless of the cost. In the case of Griphook, he takes the Sword of Gryffindor and ends up dead not a few hours later, but because of his greed he would never have let Harry keep the sword for a couple of days to destroy the Horcruxes with (not that it mattered in the end anyhow), and maybe ended up alive and one sword richer (because canon Harry would definitely have upheld his end of the deal).

The whole way Griphook behaves - ruthlessly pursuing profit regardless of the risks, refusing to acknowledge mercy or services rendered (Harry and Dobby save his /life/, after all, and instead the pointy-toothed twat wants the sword as a trade before he even /considers/ helping Harry /save the world/) is indicative to me of how goblins will generally behave.
