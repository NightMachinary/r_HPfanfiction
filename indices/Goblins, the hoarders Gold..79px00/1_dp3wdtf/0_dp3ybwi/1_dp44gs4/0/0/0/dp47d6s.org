A completely goblin-centric fic /can/ be great (I'll point you to linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone)), but even if the story is not, I think it would be very easy for a little surface-digging to come up in a fic. The same Hermione who started SPEW would, I think, only need a little push to start campaigning for equal goblin rights or something of the kind.

On the ownership principle and Griphook's behavior --- it's always possible it's mostly an excuse to get expensive stuff from wizards, but isn't it more fascinating if it's really one of their core values? As in, it's /not/ about how much the object is /worth/ --- what if the "the original owner is the only one who has a claim" principle is as essential to goblin morals as "don't rape women in the street because they're attractive"? Any moment he kept the Sword in Harry's hands, Griphook would have been failing to uphold a core axiom of morals he'd been laboring under his /entire life/. No wonder he'd slip. Indeed, Griphook's actions make no business sense at all; a skilled banker /would/ have correctly assumed Harry would give the Sword fairly in the end, and bided his time; and that's precisely why it makes more sense that goblins, who are known for their cunning, would genuinely believe the Sword should return to its rightful owners immediately, as opposed to it just being an excuse.

Also, even if you disregard all fo the above... note that Griphook is a /banker/. It stands to reason he'd be greedier than average. Few would argue that some /human/ bankers are the same sort of greedy.
