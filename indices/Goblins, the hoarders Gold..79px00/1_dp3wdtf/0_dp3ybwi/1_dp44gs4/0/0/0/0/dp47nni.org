You present an interesting hypothesis, for sure, but that's what it is - a hypothesis.

We don't know why goblins are like what they are in canon, only that they /are/ that way. Griphook might've been having a moral crisis, we don't know. What we do know is that he was happy to sabotage the best chance for the entire world, his species included, at freedom and prosperity for the chance to get his grubby little hands on a sword he would most certainly have gotten if he'd waited. Without creating fanon explanations all we have is a greedy, small-minded, pathetic little bastard who is prepared to let everything go to shit for a piece of shiny metal.

Your explanation might be more interesting or well thought out, but in terms of how I like my goblins represented in stories, I say, /like canon/. As in, like Griphook, Bagman's Debtors, all of them.
