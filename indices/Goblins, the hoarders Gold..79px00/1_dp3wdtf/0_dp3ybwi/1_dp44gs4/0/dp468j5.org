Well, we only ever see Goblins /in their dealings with wizards/. It's like trying to paint a picture of muggleborns from the point of view of the Death Eaters.

As for canon Goblin values other than "WE'VE /GOT/ TO HAVE -- MONEYYYYY!", there's also their whole ownership system that says an artifact can only be owned by its craftsman.
