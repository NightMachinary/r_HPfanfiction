Paraphrasing from someone much smarter than I am:

Deep underground, the Goblin people have records that go back to when most of the other races were learning about fire...the racial memory of the Goblins extends to days beyond reckoning. At least, beyond reckoning to anyone who isn't a Goblin. Goblins keep their records chiseled into stone and preserved for all time with mystical might. While the spellbooks of the Wizards eventually crumble into dust, the Ledgers of the Goblins will stand in mute testament to their triumphs and failures for as long as day follows night and night follows day.

The Ledgers of the Goblins measure in exact terms the location of all the cool things that the Goblin people have found, they give tips for dealing with problems that Goblins have overcome in the past, and they record in excruciating detail every bad thing that anyone has ever done to the Goblin race. The fact that sometimes humans commit atrocities against Goblins means that each and every Goblin child grows up reared on vivid and gory stories of generations of conflicts with humans -- and humans really don't. From the human perspective... nothing is happening at all. Even Wizards -- who are, unlike muggles, currently aware of the Goblin people -- don't live nearly as long as Goblins do, and that means that they don't have an ongoing war with Goblins on any timescale that they can appreciate.

This discontinuity leads to Goblins being much better at the eternal war they are fighting with the humans than their opponents. That's because no-one else really has the perspective to see that it is an ongoing conflict... really, the Goblins keep winning because they are the only ones playing.

So life is pretty weird for a Goblin. As a Goblin, you know that you are in an eternal struggle with the Wizards, and humans in general, really. You also know that several times in your life, Wizards are going to behave towards the Goblin people as if nothing was wrong and have flourishing trade relations instead. But you also know that once every couple of Wizard generations (which is to say, several times in your life, if you happen to be a Goblin) some warlord or bureaucrat is going to arise and send hordes of Wizards to destroy your family. So if Goblins come off as being intolerant jerks, that's why.
