linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone)'s worldbuilding of inner, non-wizard-related Goblin culture is so good it has become my go-to headcanon. As for their dealings with wizards, I think the banktellers of Gringotts, for the most part, are annoyed at wizards' inefficiency. There is no one on Earth more obnoxious to the typical goblin's mind than Minister Fudge --- fussy, bumbling and never getting anything done. The Gringotts employee, above all, strive to be practical, no-nonsense and efficient in their work.

This annoyance at how slow wizards are, together with the patronizing, racist attitude a lot of the purebloodists show to them, is an explosive combo that makes most of the banktellers grouchy and cutting in their dealings with wizards. Politeness /certainly/ isn't going to get you anywhere with them, because it's only more useless babbling that wastes their valuable time.

Goblins, of course, play their part in the constant misunderstandings between them and wizards --- though their leaders might not be, a lot of goblin workers are just as racist against humans than wizards are against them.

All this being said, they keep working with wizards because #1 wizards have all the gold, and #2 it's the best they can do to avoid complete genocide at their hands anyway. In light of Option One, yes, goblins would do just about everything for some more gold, and combined with #2 this means that they are willing to dabble in illegality off-the-books if it means more gold at the stupid wizards' expense.

Goblins are /not/ warlike, rough though they may appear. Their culture is built around craftsmanship, and fiercely defending the products of their craft once they are done. Their dragons and axes and Dark Goblin guards are all born of their almost Scrooge-McDuck-like, paranoid need to defend their possessions against any attackers or thieves --- not a holdover from ancient warrior ways.

*Not every Goblin works in Gringotts*. Though a vast majority of the British population does, there are, of course, indepenant goblin workers who farm or some such.
