[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is an excellent postwar AU story, although it does not involve dimensional travels.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is an extreme AU fic where a major divergence happened in 1981.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925), is a dimensional travel in which Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville made it to another universe where things went quite differently. It's a very good, very emotional story.

Canon Harry meeting his female counterparts in another dimension is done quite often, but completed fics meeting his male ones are rare. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3959072/1/Deepest-Reflections][Deepest Reflections]], linkffn(3959072), is ok, although it's the third installment of a trilogy, beginning with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within][The Darkness Within]], linkffn(2913149).
