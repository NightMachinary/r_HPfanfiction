It's good in most technical aspects - the author has a good grasp on the english language and grammar, spelling, characterization and pacing are well done.

It does have some glaring flaws; Kuri has a tendency, in all her stories, to manufacture angst where none is needed. This has the unfortunate result of derailing the greater plot of her stories and screwing up characterization - she will twist and turn events and people to squeeze as much artificial drama as possible.

Her greatest weakness is Harry/James angsty dialogue. She can't get enough of it. Therefore you will be reading along (and going, hey this is getting pretty good) and suddendly James or Harry will do or say some contrived bullshit, which will directly lead to 15 pages of everyone feeling bad and having conversations about feeling bad and how it's /so sad/ that everone is feeling bad, on and on until all characters have had a good outcry of misery and then after some time later everyone tearfully forgives each other.

Heavy stuff right? WELL IT HAPPENS TWENTY FUCKING TIMES PER STORY.

Just before I finished the second part, my most obsessive thought was /"why doesn't a nuclear bomb drop and put all these overdramatic assholes out their misery?"/.
