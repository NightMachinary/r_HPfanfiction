Almost exactly as you described, except for the "Luke Skywalker" bit.

I wouldn't be too put out about it. Given that there's over 500k fanfics for Harry Potter, you can bet if there's an idea, that some fanfic author has at least touched upon it. I've read more than one where Harry is convinced he's force sensitive, but that was the one that most closely resembled your prompt.
