Besides reccomending linkffn(The many Harry Potters of Little Hangleton) and linkffn(Dimension Hopping for beginners) I'd like to thank those who posted in this sub for being the cause of my boss giving me weird looks for the next two weeks.

Edit: linkffn(Biting the hand that feeds you) and its sequel as well.
