I find that fics tagged with humor generally just make me cringe, not laugh. Much like comedies when talking movies.

Good drama where I'm pulled into the story and feel with the characters, jokes there can make me laugh.

The only humor fic that I remember really liking was linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6580862/1/Haylie-Doesn-t-Do-Normal]]), but it's been too long since I read it and I don't remember what I liked about it.
