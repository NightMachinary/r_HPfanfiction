In the Call of Cthulhu roll playing game, doing magic by definition causes insanity. Although it's heavily implied you need to be insane just to want to do it.

Though that universe's spells are a but more.... balls to the wall. For example, the ritual for casting the equivalent of polyjuice requires the person to consume every single bit of the body of the person they're going to impersonate (though they can do it over several months and it's permanent so they can subsequently change appearance at will). Overall, the CoC grimoire makes making Horcrixes look a bit wimpy - I mean, you only need to kill /one/ person.

It'd be interesting if there's something similar in the HP universe, bured deep at the back of the most secure part of the restricted section. Spells that even Voldemort would just nope the hell away from.
