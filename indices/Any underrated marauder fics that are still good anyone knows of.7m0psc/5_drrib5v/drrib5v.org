[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11993367/1/Crossing-Lines][Crossing Lines]] by plutoplex isn't really Marauders centric, however the plot is centered around them.

Basically, the Weasley Twins are in their 6th year attempting to get their names into the Goblet of Fire since they are not of age yet. Fred and George tried creating something that would age them, however they instead ended up in the Marauder's era. This story is really unique overall though.
