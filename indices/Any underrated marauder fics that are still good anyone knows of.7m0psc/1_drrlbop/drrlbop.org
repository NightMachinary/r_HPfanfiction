[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5753105/1/Glass-of-Water][Glass of Water]] by lyin is one that should be more popular, if you haven't read it.

I like it because it doesn't try to do too much and tell the entire story of the Marauders, and instead focuses on the aftermath of the werewolf prank on their friendship. It's Lily POV, but it's mostly about them.
