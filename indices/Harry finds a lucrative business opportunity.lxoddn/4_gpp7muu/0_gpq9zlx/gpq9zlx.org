Not necessarily, without entering too much on the same old and frankly already tired discussion the magical world's instance on altering the state of your mind is ambiguous at /best/, with something's being forbidden (like the imperious) while others like the cheering charm are not only allowed but a part of the school's official curriculum. To be fair though, the main reason drugs are bad is because the amount of the substances needed to cause the sought effects causes certain chemical and hormonal reactions on the brain which causes damage to the nervous system, this could quite easily simply not be a consequence of the main magical means.

Plus by Pottermore Wizards are supposedly immune to many muggle health-hazards, so quite possible that cannabis, opium or even absinthe would just be plainly useless.
