Just my headfanon here, but I think of the Cloak as protecting the wearer from an untimely death. Harry wasn't in any immediate danger when the fake Moody spotted him, so the magical eye worked as normal. Likewise, Dumbledore would never mean Harry any harm, so he could both see through its illusion and Freeze Harry in the Astronomy Tower.
