IMO, the idea of deathly hallows didn't come up until the sixth or even the seventh book. When the cloak was first introduced, it wasn't meant to be such a powerful magical artifact but a rather amusing and rare device and so it was depicted to have some weaknesses. But recall how, in the seventh book, the cloak's power was emphasized when Harry and co. apparated at Hogsmead and a Death Eater tried to summon it only for the cloak to refuse to budge.

As far as I am concerned, it is a (very) minor plot hole in Rowling's story and as a fanfic writer (who is heavily into the MoD!Harry genre), I tend to ignore it. Why one of my stories is even centered on the invisibility cloak itself.
