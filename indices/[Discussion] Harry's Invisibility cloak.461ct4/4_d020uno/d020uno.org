They probably couldnt see him, but Harry probably made noise and someone observant enough could pick up on it. The eye might just have seen ripples of sound. If Harry had used a silencing spell then it would be more conspicuos. Basically Harry wasnt adept enough at using the cloak by that point. If the cloak is sentient, then maybe it needs proper intent to work fully like a wand.
