I know it has been a few days since this discussion started, but here is my take on it.

When the first book in the series was published, nobody knew or suspected that Harry Potter had a horcrux in his scar. Of course, in hindsight it was heavily foreshadowed in the hospital scene with Dumbledore, but at that point in time nobody could know which direction Rowling would go with it. The same is true for the cloak. During Harry's first year he only knew that the invisibility cloak was a gift that was originally his father's. I don't remember all that happened with the cloak throughout the book series, but (and this is important) it was said that invisibility cloaks faded with age. Yet, although people close to Harry knew about this being a Potter family heirloom, did anybody ever question the apparent longevity of the cloak over the years? No.

We can assume that invisibility cloaks are likely rather expensive, but their existence must be widely known, or someone like Ron would probably not have known about them. This shouldn't be taken as a dig at the second youngest Weasley, but he clearly was not enthusiastic about learning and Rowling has never shown us that wizards received any kind of established pre-Hogwarts education. Whatever he learned about the wizarding world must have come from his own experience of growing up in a magical family and from whatever second-hand sources that were available to him (the Wizarding Wireless radio, the Daily Prophet, etc). Taking this extrapolation and continuing with what I already wrote earlier (no wizard ever caught on to Harry's cloak being extra special), we can assume that wizards know about the existence of invisibility cloaks like us non-magicals know about, say, helicopters or aeroplanes. Just like we couldn't tell much about the inner workings of such a flying machine (how many people know how many maintenance hours are required for every flying hour for example?), neither did school children, professors or other adults who found out about Harry's cloak ever come to suspect it for being special.

It comes down to this: do you want to believe in continuity or not? Did Rowling already know about the unexplored and unexplained concepts she used in her first book, or did she merely write a children's story with lots of either shallow or accidental insinuations, some of which she then chose to take up in the sequels? It wouldn't change anything about the topic, but in my opinion, Harry had the legendary Cloak of Invisibility from the very beginning in the first book. For what other reason could Dumbledore have wanted to borrow that specific cloak, after all?

Now on to the second question. Harry's cloak is truly the Cloak of Invisibility of legend, but was it handed to the youngest Peverell brother by Death himself, or is it merely an ancient magical artefact?

Over the years and throughout Harry Potter's time at Hogwarts, we have come to learn about a great many magical things that survived until the present, but little concrete information about the age or source of magical objects is actually available in the books. The Sorting Hat is without a doubt the one truly magical object that can be safely attributed to an ancient wizard like Godric Gryffindor, but more remotely, other objects like the moving and talking paintings all over the castle must have endured the test of time as well. While this does not answer the question in any way, it is a good set-up for the opinion I want to express. Even in the first book it is made clear, that impressive magical objects have been created many hundreds if not a thousand years in the past or more. Some of them have been deemed so useful (or indestructible) that they survived until Harry started his first year at Hogwarts.

This is a clear indication that magic was not (entirely) primitive in the past, just like our own forefathers were smarter than many people of today realize. It has taken us hundreds of years to arrive at well thought-out explanations for some of the biggest feats done in ancient times, like the creation of the pyramids for example. Even today many yet disbelieve the power of human ingenuity and organisation that were required.

The Statute of Secrecy was only introduced in 1692, before that you have centuries of time where magicals lived and interacted openly with muggles and, if history is to be believed, not often peacefully. Who is to say, that there was not some well known, feared and a bit deranged wizard living alone in some remote part of the country, who came to be called by the title of "Death" by the non-magicals living in the area? Don't forget, that the story of the three brothers is set in a time, when non-magicals were not only a very superstitious lot but also conditioned to believe in God(s) and Faith through a strong community. Just like people in the Middle Ages saw the devil in everything they could not explain, centuries earlier there existed a true, if baser, spirituality in the common man.

Some wizard in ancient times has probably created a number of magical objects and for some reason that we're not privy to, he gave them to three brothers crossing his lands. Or maybe the brothers even stole the desirable objects from him and made the story up. That would not be a huge surprise, since the tale clearly doesn't paint the brothers in their best light. Whatever may have been the truth, how the story got out would be easy to explain, after the oldest brother started bragging about an unbeatable wand. There are many ways this could've gone down of course, but that is the likeliest explanation in my opinion. Mostly though I like this theory, because it allows for the cloak to be extraordinary without being perfect. It's not a foolproof method to become entirely undetectable after all, just perfectly invisible.
