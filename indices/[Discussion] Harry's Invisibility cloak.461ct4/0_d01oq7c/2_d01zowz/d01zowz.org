I just thought of a few more things, if it was Death (or some being like that) which gave them the hallows.

"But Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three brothers..." (TTotTB). I see Death here as acting truly cunning, like a djinn. Granting gifts (wishes) in such a way that satisfies the request, but not the intent /of/ the request.

1) Elder Wand: "...a wand more powerful than any in existence...that must always win /duels/ for its /owner/...worthy of a wizard /who had conquered Death/!" (TTotTB).

There are so many possible loopholes in this request. "Must always win /duels/", so if Dumbledore didn't formally challenge Grindelwald to a duel, or if their fight was during a battle of many wizards, it still holds true. "For its /owner/", perhaps the only true owner was the eldest peverell brother, so once he was murdered and the wand stolen, no other wizard was ever the owner, and while it was still a powerful wand it didn't guarantee wins for anyone anymore. "Worthy of a wizard /who had conquered Death/", surviving a river crossing that most die doing probably isn't conquering Death (though it might be defying Death), so perhaps the only one who would be guaranteed wins, the true "owner" of the wand, would be one who was immortal (like flamel and the stone, or voldemort with his horcruxes), or the one who had united all the hallows (harry, eventually).

2) The Resurrection Stone: "...asked for the power to /recall others from Death/." (TTotTB)

We already know the trickery of Death in this case, he gave the power to recall the dead in spirit form for a limited time, not true resurrection like the second brother intended. A clear case of Death cunningly avoiding the intent of the request.

3) Cloak of Invisibility: "The youngest brother...did not trust Death. So he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from /that place/ without being /followed/ by Death." (TTotTB)

Here is where its a bit more muddled. Later we see the line, "But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never able to find him." (TTotTB) To paraphrase the end, when the third brother took off the cloak he greeted Death as an old friend and departed this life.

Obviously while the cloak allowed the brother to leave without being followed, it also prevented death from finding him later. There are 2 options i see. First, Death was cunning and the cloak lost its power over Death after the third brother left /that place/, but since the third brother was "the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers" (TTotTB), he took other precautions to ensure Death didn't find him later like his brothers. To add to his ruse, the brother made a show of taking off his cloak when he was ready to die, in order to add to the mystery of his heirloom cloak. Second, Death was unable to work around the restrictions of the request to his advantage, due to Death's powers. There was no item other than Death's own cloak that would enable someone to leave a place "without being /followed/ by Death." So "Death, most /unwillingly/, handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility." (TTotTB)
