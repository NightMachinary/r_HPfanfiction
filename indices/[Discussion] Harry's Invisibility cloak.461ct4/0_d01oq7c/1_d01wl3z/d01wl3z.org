I'm of the opinion that so many fairy tales have true roots (particularly in the wizarding world), that the peverell story needs to be more accurate than "the 3 brothers had these items".

Now, this could go many ways. They may have hidden themselves while designing them, and decided the item's power was too strong and more shouldn't be made, so they made up a story where they were given them by "death"

It could be they were able to make a deal with death itself while journeying. Or perhaps it was a demon of some sort, that they had never seen or heard of before and so they dubbed it death, due to its fearsome visage.

Regardless, i don't think it is /obvious/ that it just a story and the peverell brothers made the items. Its hidden in the mists of time, and without being given more information we cant separate fact from fiction
