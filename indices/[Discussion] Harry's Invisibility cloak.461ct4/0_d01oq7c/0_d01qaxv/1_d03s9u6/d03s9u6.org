The Priori Incantatem effect on Tom's wand managed to recreate, or pull back from behind the veil, souls of the people it killed or at least convincing enough facsimiles of them. This would tell us that a part of a person killed by the killing curse lives with them, and yet this doesn't make sense and drawing a spirit back is much more likely.

The Resurrection Stone might be doing just that, only it is more aimed than the effect on wands because it's a tool made specifically for this purpose.
