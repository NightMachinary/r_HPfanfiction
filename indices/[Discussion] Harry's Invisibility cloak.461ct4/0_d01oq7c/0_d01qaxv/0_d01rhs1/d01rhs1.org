Well, necromancy does exist in the HP world (e.g. Inferi), although no form of completely successful necromancy is known. Cadmus Peverell, who no doubt was a very talented wizard, may have studied necromancy deeply after the loss of his loved one (although that may have been a myth). And what he made (the Resurrection Stone) was an extremely powerful, groundbreaking discovery, like the other two Hollows. However, it too had limitations of necromancy, with the "shades" not having a full form and "suffering greatly" after prolonged existence in the living world.

As for whether the shades were actually their souls or not, I have no clue. Canon doesn't say, so it's up to your interpretation.
