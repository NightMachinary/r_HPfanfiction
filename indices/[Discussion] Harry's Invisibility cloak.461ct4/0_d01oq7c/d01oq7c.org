What you're forgetting is that the Tale of Three brothers is a fairy tale for children. It has some elements of truth in it, but much of it is exaggerated/mystified, just like most other fairy tales. For example, it obviously wasn't "Death" who gave the Hallows to the brothers; rather, it was that the Peverells were gifted wizards who created powerful artifacts, which then were passed down as legends.

This is proven by the fact that the elder wand does not guarantee victory for its owner (as the legend says), as evidenced by Dumbledore's victory over Grindelwald when the latter was in possession of the Death Stick. Similarly, while the cloak is special in that the invisibility does not fade, its power of escaping "Death" is obviously just an exaggeration.
