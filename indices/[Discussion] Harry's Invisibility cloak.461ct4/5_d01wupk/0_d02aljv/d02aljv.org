  Perhaps at some point dumbledore enlisted real moody's help to see what his fake eye made of the cloak, and being the paranoid guy he is, moody tagged the cloak with a subtle charm keyed to his eye so he would never be snuck up on by someone wearing it.

I prefer the idea of Moody's eye being a loophole. The cloak acts like a protective coat so anyone looking at it can't see the person behind it, but we know Moody's eye can see through things, so it bypasses the cloak's protection. So Moody's eye isn't stronger, it just hits straight onto the cloak's weakness.

I don't think a tracking charm (are those even mentioned in canon?) would work, since the cloak is immune to detection magic iirc. There's one scene I remember where someone tries to summon the cloak off Harry, and it's immune to it, and then when Harry talks about the Hallows later he mentions that his cloak doesn't just make him invisible, it /hides/ him, and although I can't remember the exact phrasing he definitely talks about how it can't be affected by locating magic.
