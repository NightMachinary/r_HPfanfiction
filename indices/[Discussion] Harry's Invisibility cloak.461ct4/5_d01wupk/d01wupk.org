I'm not sure what to do about moody, but it never bothered me that Dumbledore could see through the cloak. He had it in his possession for 11 quiet years, and he was obsessed with the hallows in his youth. I have no doubt that he would have spent the time to study it and determine how it hides the wearer and determine if there is any way to circumvent its invisibility. As dumbledore is brilliant, obsessed, and with a plethora of time, he succeded

Perhaps at some point dumbledore enlisted real moody's help to see what his fake eye made of the cloak, and being the paranoid guy he is, moody tagged the cloak with a subtle charm keyed to his eye so he would never be snuck up on by someone wearing it.
