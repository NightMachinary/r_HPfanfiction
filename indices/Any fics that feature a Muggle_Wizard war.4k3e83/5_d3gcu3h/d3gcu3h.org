I wonder, would a Muggle Wizard conflict really be a war. Sure, Muggles have nuclear bombs, but a wizard could just imperio the president/prime minister into surrendering and destroying all nuclear bombs. Disillusionment spells and imperio's could destroy the entire government and the leaders of the army(general, lieutenant general). You'd have to think wizard's would win really easily.
