More of a sci-fi exploration story, but the overarching plot and both beginning and end are Muggle/Wizard wars - linkffn(Voyage of the Starship Hedwig). It's complete and there's a sequel which I haven't read (it's an unfinished Star Wars/HP crossover, although the first story has no Star Wars in it whatsoever).

The story is very original, and I recommend trying it out, although it's at times rather brutal.
