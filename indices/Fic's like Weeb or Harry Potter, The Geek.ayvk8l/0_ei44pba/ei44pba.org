[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff][Harry the Hufflepuff]] might interest you.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] ? Not harry as MC.

Maybe try some SI's? They tend to be similar, like, there's this one where the MC makes a beam ala megaman by mixing Lumos and special glass. I'm not sure if this is the same one where the story goes to shit by making the MC power up his magic/weapons via butter, literally butter but that's not important.
