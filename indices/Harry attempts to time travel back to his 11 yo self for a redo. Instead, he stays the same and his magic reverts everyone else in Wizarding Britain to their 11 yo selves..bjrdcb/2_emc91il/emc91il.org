I'm pretty sure that would be more catastrophic than the Thanos snap.

All of society would crumble if suddenly everyone was replaced by a 11 year old who hasn't gone to Hogwarts yet.

Nobody would know any magic, except for little bits kids picked up from parents.

The food supply chain would be completely broken and the muggle world would experience a weird phenomenon of tens of thousands of hungry 11 year olds with no parents and weird delusions about magic appearing out of nowhere.

Maybe other magical countries would intervene and kidnap the majority of the people turned into children. Maybe letting their versions of the DoM try to find out what the hell happened in Britain and how to undo it.

If they don't, the statute of secrecy would pretty much get destroyed. 11 year olds aren't responsible enough to keep it secret, especially not if they are hungry and there's no food left in the Wizarding World.
