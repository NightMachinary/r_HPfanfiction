Voldemort is someone who totally loves destructive things. Never, ever assume that because the Dark Lord hates Muggles, he would not adopt their modern inventions he finds useful. If Bellatrix runs around with a knife as secondary weapon, what's to prevent Voldemort from using a [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minigun][minigun]] that is magically cooled, lightened, recoil free, and fed by a vastly expanded magazine?

I think the following scene should rather be funny:

  Harry and his guerrilla fighters have finally surprised the Dark Lord in the Forest of Dean. He strode forward and declared: “Tom, your evil ways end here today!”

  To his surprise, a minigun emerged from Voldemort's enchanted left sleeve. Firing at 3000 rounds per minute, it cut down Harry to several pieces before he could even scream. Harry's friends returned fire after the initial shock, but their bullets bounced off harmlessly against Voldemort's robe, charmed with Dark Lord's strongest Protego Maxima. It didn't take more than 60 seconds before they were all silenced by Voldemort's minigun and killing curses.

  Looking at the carnage, Voldemort madly cackled: “Muahahaha! Honestly Harry Potter, do you really believe I was that incompetent as not to make a few cool weapons of my own?”
