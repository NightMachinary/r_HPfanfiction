There's these two absolutely amazing ones.

[[https://my.w.tt/itrdEoYXkcb][Tightly Knit]] by kmbell92. It is a long fic but it is sooo worth it.

Description: Life started off complicated for young Eleanor Ross after being born to a muggle mother while showing her magical capabilities at an early age. Growing up in a household where her mother fears her, Eleanor mostly finds herself isolated from the outside world as her mother intends on keeping Eleanor's abilities a secret. However, Eleanor finds relief after she turns eleven years old when a letter arrives in the post and a woman comes knocking on her door to reveal that Eleanor is a witch. While things do not necessarily become easier for the mother and daughter, Eleanor finally finds a place where she can fit in at none other than Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. A few years later, Eleanor is caught up in the middle of the pranking chaos that is brought on by none other than Fred and George Weasley. No student or professor is deemed safe as the twins have dedicated their fifth year to pranking everyone in the castle. So far, it's been a piece of cake until they attempt to prank Eleanor, the unsuspecting Hufflepuff. At first, they are convinced that it was a simple miscalculation, but as prank, after prank fails, something is up. Fred finds his curiosity piqued when he witnesses one of the pranks literally bounce off the girl and becomes more than determined to figure out how Eleanor is dodging their mischievous ways. He wants to figure out her ways, but he and George have to get out of detention first.

Description: Lexi Hooper has been a Harry Potter fan since the very start. One day, Lexi and her friend decide to go to King's Cross Station for a memorable cosplay. But what started as a joke, turns out to be both Lexi's dream and her nightmare. Just for a laugh, Lexi starts to run towards the wall between platform 9 and 10, careful not to hit it too hard. But the shocking part is, the wall disappears and she passes the barrier, suddenly finding herself in platform 9 and Â¾. At first she thinks that she's just dreaming and goes with the flow. But when she figures out that everything is as real as it can get, Lexi realises that she has the power to change everything and save everyone; because she knows exactly what is going to happen next and just how to stop it, even though she is just a Muggle. (I know it doesn't mention F&G Weasley but trust me, they are main characters)
