I remember, there was one fic where Bellatrix broke out of Azkaban in third year instead of Sirius; she was a panther animagus, and crazy-crazy rather than monster-crazy. She confessed that she hadn't tortured Neville's parents into insanity, but rather placed a specific curse on them that gave that impression, but could be reversed.

Hmm...I haven't read it in years, though. I wonder which one it was?
