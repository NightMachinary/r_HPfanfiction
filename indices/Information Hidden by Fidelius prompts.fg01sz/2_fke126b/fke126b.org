I think the Fidelius can only protect locations, but this is a neat concept.

A lot of this also hinges on what happens to the secret, and to what lengths the universe goes to keep that secret. For example, could you fidelius the sun? If you could, it would become completely undetectable, and nobody would know what is going on anymore. If its gravity becomes undetectable, does that mean its gravity stops taking effect on the earth? If its light becomes undetectable, does that mean the earth will freeze over? What about light speed, could a being on Alpha Centauri still see the sun's light for four years, despite that secret having been protected for 4 years of "objective time"?
