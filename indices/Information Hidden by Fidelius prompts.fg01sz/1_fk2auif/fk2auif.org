--"Harry Potter is Weak"-- Instant coinflip, now you've got a OP Harry, or a decently powerful one. Although, does the Fidelius properly fuck with magic? Or is it just the fact that everyone will percieve Harry as powerful?

So you also have a bunch of hijinks to deal with that, Harry casts a simple incendio, and a gout of fiendfyre explodes the entire classroom, Harry casts Wingardium Leviosa and lifts the castle off of the ground. Etc etc.

--"Harry Potter is bad at Instruments"-- Once more, can a Fidelius /make/ you good at something, or will people just percieve you as good?

Another shitload of Hijinks, Ala Harry picking up a accordion and playing the STALKER theme instinctively, etc etc.

--"Albus Dumbledore Can Lie, and can Omit the Truth"-- And there goes everything pre fifth year, most likely destroying the timeline. I can't even go into detail with how much you could fuck with this.
