Yes! This is one thing that makes me abandon fics immediately, and more vengefully than any other trope. If anything, it would just turn HP into the next Voldemort, fighting and hating against /everything and everyone,/ for it was the Wizarding culture that threw him away, and left him on a doorstep like rubbish. Sure, the Dursleys were abusive, but they had nothing to do with Harry suddenly appearing at their house and ruining their lives.
