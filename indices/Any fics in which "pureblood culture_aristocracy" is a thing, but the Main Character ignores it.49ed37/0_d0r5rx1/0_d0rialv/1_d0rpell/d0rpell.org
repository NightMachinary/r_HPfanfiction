Well, abused children could have well turned out to be criminals or psychopaths.

It would not make a nice story, but it could be a very likely scenario.

Canon Dumbledore, imho, was an incompetent fool. Dumping Harry to the "worst sort of muggle" (according to his deputy) and not checking up on him was completely and utterly brain dead. The odds of an abused Harry Potter becoming the next Tom Riddle or joining Lord Voldemort were SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER than the selfless and all-loving Harry Potter in the books.
