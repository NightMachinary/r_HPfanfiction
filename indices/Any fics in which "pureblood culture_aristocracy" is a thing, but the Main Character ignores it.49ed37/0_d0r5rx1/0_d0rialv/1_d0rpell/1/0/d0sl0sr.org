1st book we find out HP lives in a cupboard.

2nd book Petunia tries to hit him on the head with a frying pan and they lock him in a room on starvation rations.

3rd book they invite round a relative that's been known to hit him and who sets her dog on him. They then let this relative insult his dead parents to his face.

5th book Vernon grabs him round the throat with both hands and tries to strangle him for listening to the news. And after the Patronus warning Vernon says that he hopes Harry gets the death penalty.

I think people either remember the Dursleys right or are sometimes even too kind. Short of beating and raping Harry they couldn't be much worse.
