I'm trying to plot out a Harry who doesn't think much of Dumbledore (left on doorstep? would you trust the guy who did that?), Hagrid (the dude kidnaps Harry, Hagrid's a nice guy but wth?), Fudge (no trials, summary executions?). A Harry who loves magic but not most magicals and for sure not their culture. Not bashing but a reasonable response to canon events.

I think it ends with a fuel/air bomb detonating over a small graveyard in Little Hangleton.
