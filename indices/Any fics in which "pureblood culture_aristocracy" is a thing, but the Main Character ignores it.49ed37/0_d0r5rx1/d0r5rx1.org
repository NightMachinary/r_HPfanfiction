That would be really cool to see actually. Usually when "pureblood culture" features very prominently in a fic it's a slytherin!Harry where he becomes some sort of grey!independent! rascist douchebag.

Having asshole wizards justifying there blood purism with "muh culture" does get pretty annoying.
