Considering that the "Marriage Law" trope was one started by Snape/Hermione 'shippers as a writing prompt for their own [and also as a method to shoehorn Snape and Hermione into a relationship], that someone took the idea and wrote a work of Hermione starting a revolution /against/ it is hilarious to me. Usually in these works of fanfiction, Hermione completely resigns herself to her fate, or even decides to /support/ a Law that, honestly, she would consider "barbaric" in the books. It's a breath of fresh air to see Hermione actually in-character in a work like "Revolution".
