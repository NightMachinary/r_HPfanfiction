The number of stories where Hermione of all people rolls over and accepts letting others tell her who to sleep with was what prompted me to write the story (and my first fanfiction story). To think that the same people who had to save the Ministry from Voldemort would let those cretins order them around is simply stupid - they have beaten one regime, they can beat a weaker one more easily.
