Kinda this in combination with Starfox5's reply below. Harry never struck me as a formal kinda guy. I'm somewhat vague in what I'd like to read. But I feel that the whole "Harry finds out he's a Lord of an Ancient and most noble bla bla and heir to supposedly extinct houses blabla" scenario has been done a massive amount of times. Yet in all those I've read, Harry responds by getting with the programme and entrenching himself in the accepted patterns of behaviour and speech. I would find the converse almost definitely more entertaining to read.

There's room for a lot of alternative routes those scanarios could go down, and I'd love to see a story with attention to an underdeveloped route.

Part of that could be an utter rejection of his position. An alternative would be to act somewhat similarly to your comment. Go for a cheeky Nandos with the lords.
