I hate it when I have to youtube a song to get what the author is trying to get at "Character is singing this obscure song but not the commonly known version but this specific version which changes the tone of the song and there for the meaning of this scene" and that youtube vid will of course not be available in my country....

A snipet at the beginning or end of a chapter or scene is fine anything more is completely over done
