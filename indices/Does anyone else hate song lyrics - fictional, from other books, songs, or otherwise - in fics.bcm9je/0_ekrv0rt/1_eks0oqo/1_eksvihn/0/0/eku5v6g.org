You don't have a full stop or comma at all in quite a few of them, and for being 'Australian English' you sure don't use single quotes for dialogue.

/these/ quotes:

#+begin_quote
  "I'm Olivia".

  "Nice to meet you Olivia".
#+end_quote

/(ch2, last two lines of scene 2)/

...should have the full stops on the inside. It's Australian English proper to have the full stop on the inside of the quote when what's inside the quote is a complete sentence.
