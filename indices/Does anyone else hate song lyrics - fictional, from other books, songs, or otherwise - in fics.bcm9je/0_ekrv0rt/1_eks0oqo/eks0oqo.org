I do this in the second chapter of my story: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13105802/1/Singing-Crying-Laughing-and-Fighting]] , as the main characters work at a music shop, and music is a pretty important part of their lives. Not sure if it's well executed though. I tried to avoid just listing the lyrics, but actually describing the song through the characters eyes, and the action of the characters as it plays.
