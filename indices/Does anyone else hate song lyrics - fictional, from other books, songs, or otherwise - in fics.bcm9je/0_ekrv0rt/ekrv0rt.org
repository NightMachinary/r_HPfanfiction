I don't mind a snippet at the beginning of a chapter, or a reference to 'what I was listening to while writing this' at the end.

So long as you don't interrupt the story with it, it can be rather flavorful and appropriate.

There are exceptions where interrupting the story can be done well, but I'd /generally/ advise against it unless you have a very good reason. I'd say only the best authors can do it well, and they'd be able to better categorize the exact exceptions of when it works.
