You see, you may say this as a joke, but in this kind of fic, I wouldn't mind lyrics. Its when they just come out of the blue that cringes the shit out of me.

The only time I can remember a fic using lyrics well is from a Were!Harry with the lyrics from both Monster and Demons from Imagine Dragons. It fit perfectly with both the mood, the setting and that particular interpretation of the lyrics. It also made me fall in love with Imagine Dragons.
