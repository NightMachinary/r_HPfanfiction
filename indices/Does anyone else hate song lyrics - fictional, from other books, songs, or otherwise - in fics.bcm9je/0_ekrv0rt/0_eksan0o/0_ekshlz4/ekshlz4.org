this inspired me to start a camp rock Hogwarts fanfic and it's all your fault...

/clap/ /clap/ your fault your fault!

/clap *clap/ my fault my fault?

What will happen during the summer holidays when Harry and his friends go to wizarding rock camp. Will Harry and Draco overcome their differences for the big concert at the end of camp? Will Hermione get to know the real Snape after she becomes the lead singer for his Heavy Metal Workshop?
