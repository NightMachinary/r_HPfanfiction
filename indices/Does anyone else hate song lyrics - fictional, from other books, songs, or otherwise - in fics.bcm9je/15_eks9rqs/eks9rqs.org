I usually loathe song fics. Ones that are stories inspired by a specific song (though I have done one myself and constantly debate one based on fort minor's kenji). But a single line or two that are relevant to the story/chapter don't bother me. Mostly because I can be pretentious with my lyrical references like Godspeed you black emperor or a LeonArd Cohen reference or Harry exploring punk and metal due to tonks in my fics.
