I read a fic where Mcgonnigal was telling Sirius not to give up and word for word quoted the song Stand by Rascal Flatts. After I laughed my ass off about a scottish woman quoting a country song i closed the fic. I hate song lyrics in songs especially when they have no purpose for the plot OR are songs that weren't around during the time period.
