Oh god yes. Tolkien and Tom Bombadil have a lot to answer for!

Fanfic authors need to realise that their favourite pop song is a load of insipid crap that most people don't like, many haven't heard of, which no-one will remember next week, and which says nothing of any value. It doesn't add anything to the story.

You should only even think about including it if a character is a musician, but even then it should be done sparingly and is really hard to do well.
