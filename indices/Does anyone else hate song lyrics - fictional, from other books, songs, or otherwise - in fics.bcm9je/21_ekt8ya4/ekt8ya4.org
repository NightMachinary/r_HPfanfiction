It kind of depends on how it's incorporated into the story, like I don't mind if it's a quote at the beginning, something in the author's note, or a title used, but when it disrupts story flow I hate it. If the author says that they listened to a song, which inspired them to write the story, that's fine, but when the story flow is interrupted by lyrics from the song in italics or whatever, that's where I draw the line.

Songfics have been around for who knows how long, and I swear that I don't see them as often as I used to. I've never really cared for them or really look for them in particular. When I see the lyrics in the fic itself in the middle of the goddamn story, I can't take it seriously, since that takes me so out of the moment that I can't help but laugh. The whole thing comes off as a bit amateur to me. It's like watching a character die on tv or a movie, and some asshole behind you starts blasting a random song on their phone. No matter how sad the song is, it's still disruptive.
