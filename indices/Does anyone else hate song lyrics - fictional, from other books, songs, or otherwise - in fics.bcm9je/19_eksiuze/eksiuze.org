I ignore any song lyrics that are more than 3-4 lines long. If I wanted song lyrics, I'd listen to Spotify.

I also skip over the Sorting Hat's song. I don't want to slog through the canon song yet again, and whenever the author tries to create something new it usually stinks.

Speaking of slogging through: The hours-long Diagon Alley shopping trip is fast-forwarded through like you wouldn't believe. I don't want to know how many and in which colours slacks or robes he bought. Throw in the stereotypical male dread/female glee and you go straight on my shit list.
