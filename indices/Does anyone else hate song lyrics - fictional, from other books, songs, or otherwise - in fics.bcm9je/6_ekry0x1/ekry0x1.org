Only time I tolerate it is when it's a character performing the song for story reasons. Given what the Harry Potter series is, this is pretty much never the case in this fandom. Like, in Life is Strange, Max (protag) actually knows how to play the guitar and you can do so in the game, so it's common to see her serenading her girlfriend in fics. Is it ideal? Usually no, hell it's often still annoying, but at least it makes sense and it's fluff or relationship progression. There have even been a couple of fics that really pull it off and make it very enjoyable, but well, it's pretty rare.
