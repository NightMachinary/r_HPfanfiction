I don't mind it if it's done in an organic way, sort of like Stephen King puts a lot of songs into his fiction.

Particularly I don't mind songs in the Marauders era to give it that '70's feel. I imagine the Gryffindors in those days sort of looked into Muggle culture as they were trying to be better than the Death Eaters who despised everything about Muggles. You see Sirius with his motorcycle and muggle posters of women in bikinis, if they listened to some records too, or even tried going to a concert or movie (Star Wars was big enough in '77 that I imagine all the muggleborns saw it that summer), it just all fits in.

For Harry's age it's a bit harder to fit in. Harry was always kept apart from getting to enjoy anything by the Dursleys, Hermione seems to prefer reading to any other form of entertainment, and Ron of course is completely clueless.
