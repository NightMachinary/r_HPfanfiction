#+begin_quote
  Harry has a long and difficult path to overcoming not only Lord Voldemort, but also his trauma from his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys. AU with the story starting at 4th year. Harry/Fleur. This story deals seriously with abuse, which can be difficult for some readers. On Hiatus. Note in ch. 34.
