One question: How angsty is it. I mean yes, hurt/comfort, there will be some. But is it melodramatic with Harry being an arse, or angst for its own sake, if you know what I mean?

One reason I don't like some fics is they make Harry an utter arse or do angst for its own sake. Y'know, "True Art is Angsty" or some other tropes.
