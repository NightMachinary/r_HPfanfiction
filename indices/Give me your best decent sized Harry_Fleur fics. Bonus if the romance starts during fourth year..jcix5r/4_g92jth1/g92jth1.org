Most of the really good complete ones are here, so here are a few that are either incomplete or multi or both: linkffn(his angel; ingenio ab artifex; price of being noble; apex)

Also, I just realized linkffn(Cadmean victory) isn't already here. It's pretty divisive on this sub, but it and His Angel are the origin of a lot of the Harry/Fleur tropes
