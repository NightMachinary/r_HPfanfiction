/Wastelands of Time/ (linkffn(4068153)) is pretty much my go-to recommendation and it is H/F, but it doesn't exactly meet your specific requirements (nor is it a romance-centered fic).

/The Lie I've Lived/ (linkffn(3384712)) is another great fic which has the pairing but is not exactly romance-focused.

I think you might like /Euphoria/ (linkffn(11534019)) or /Letters/ (linkffn(6535391)).
