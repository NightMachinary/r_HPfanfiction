Or that there is some sort of spell residue left behind that can be detected eg magical forensics.

From canon we are told that AK victims look perfectly healthy showing no signs for why they are dead. Of course unless the AK was the only curse thrown there is a good chance that the victim would have other curse injuries. So we are back to the idea of detectable spell signatures.

Also we know that the ministry of magic can detect spells. Is it possible that they are able to detect AK's and that's how Dumbledore knows. Or if Dumbledore helped with the protective charms on Godrics Hollow did one of those charms record those battle spells? And then by checking Lily and James wand could they eliminate the spells they threw?

That's my best guess for how Dumbledore could know what happened.
