Given what we are told of the killing curse (it leaves no mark, other than people dying), it is simple to figure out that James got hit with it. Also the fact that he's downstairs means he most likely got hit 1st. Then there's Lily, dead in front of Harry's crib. That's two curses. Harry has a scar, and possibly magical residue on him. He also has that protection from Lily, Dumbledore had an entire day to figure out what it was, and how it is triggered. How Dumbledore knows the bodies' placements? Hagrid.
