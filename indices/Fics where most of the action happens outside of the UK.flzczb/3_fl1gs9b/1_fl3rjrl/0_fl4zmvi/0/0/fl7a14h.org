So with both I recommend, there's a very very /very/ small window of time (like a few paragraphs) where's he's bitter and nasty but once he sees that Harry needs "help", he turns into a decent guy. So yeah. Snape is a bit out of character. There isn't really any transformation from Snape in cannon to good parental figure Snape.

Both stories more focus more on Harry and Snape's relationship as having a father-son type bond. Less so on character development.

I'll take a look at The Wise One once I've gotten through all the fics I've saved up (I've got sooooo much to finish (≧▽≦) ) it sounds quite good!
