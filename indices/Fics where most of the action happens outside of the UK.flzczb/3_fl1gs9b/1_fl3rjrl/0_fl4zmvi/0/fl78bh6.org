Those were genuine questions - I'm curious about the answers. I'm not really anti-anything specific in this fandom myself, I'll read whatever when its done well and in an interesting/fun way.

And probably, but that's more my preference coming in to play. I'm a person of ridiculously broad tastes and interests in everything and I try to get everyone else on the same wavelength whenever possible. More breadth in searches = more stuff to read.

I'd highly recommend The Wise One that I linked in my description post at the top of the thread. It's such a good fic with such good travelling and such a good relationship between him and Sirius (and the OCs they meet), that I can't help but fangirl over it. :)
