Heh. I'm assuming you got downvoted for Snappy's involvement in those fics. Is his transition from bitter twat to parental figure dealt with at all, or is it one of those "Snape was a nice guy all along and a perfectly suitable parent that Lily totally would've made Godfather" fics with no growth toward that point?

No criticism and thanks for both recs either way, I'd just like to know which end of things I'm dealing with. :)
