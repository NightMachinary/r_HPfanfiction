Hmm... So You Want A Long Fic...

linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) is quite a long series, book 5 is in progress. Sirius escapes five years early and takes Harry away from the Dursleys. I like it because it's focused on the characters, who have both strengths and weaknesses, not on any secret Black family magic or just fixing everything from canon.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) sounded a bit ordinary/pedestrian when I first saw the premise, but it's actually a very rich and deep AU, lots of excellent world building and exploration of magic (especially potions and mind magic). Tom Riddle launched a political party instead of a war, and now Harriett Potter has both her parents alive, along with "uncles" Sirius and Remus, but as a half-blood, she isn't allowed at Hogwarts. And worse restrictions are coming.

And for a laugh, I recommend linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions). Lots of one-liners, great Snape redemption arc.
