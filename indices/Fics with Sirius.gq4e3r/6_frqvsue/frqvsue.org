I've just started reading The eighth Weasley, it's still being updated but it's pretty regular updates and I love the OC! it's kind of dark but also really sweet! It's an AU if that's your thing, but it's not too out there! I'm loving it. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24214726/chapters/58333537]]
