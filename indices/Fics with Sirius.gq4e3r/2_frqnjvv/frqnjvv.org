/A Bad Week at the Wizengamot/ a crack-fic, or at least a comedy, but the second chapter centers around Sirius Black.

/A Marauder's Plan/ involves Sirius, rather than going on the run to hide somewhere tropical, remaining in Britain to stay in

/Promises Unbroken/ is a story based on the idea that Sirius and Peter never switched as secret keepers, and it all goes from there.

Also, someone just posted this request yesterday so there are some more suggestions [[https://redd.it/gp0xnd][*here*]].
