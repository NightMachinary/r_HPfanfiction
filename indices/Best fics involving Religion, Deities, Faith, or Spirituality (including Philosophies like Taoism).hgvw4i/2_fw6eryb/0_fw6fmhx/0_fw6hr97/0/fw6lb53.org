Daoist is the romanised version so, assuming your translation is European, that makes sense from a linguistics standpoint. Not sure why they'd list it as Dao de Jing, given that's a book title, not the philosophy, but assuming the translation originated sometime in the Imperialist Europe period, it'd make sense. We weren't the most... culturally sensitive people, at the time. :D
