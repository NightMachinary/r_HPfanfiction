I mean, he definitely fits the slightly embittered, self-flagellating perspective of some Catholics I know, so I can go with that. Interesting idea, that magic is integrated into things. And to be fair, accuracy is hard in Christianity, what with there being 10,000 denominations and each of them being made up of a spectrum of believers only leads to more distinction within each one proper.

Thanks for the rec!
