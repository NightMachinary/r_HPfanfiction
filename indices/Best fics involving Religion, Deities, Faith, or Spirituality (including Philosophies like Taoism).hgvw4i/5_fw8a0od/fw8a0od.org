Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

Magic gets revealed to muggles and obviously religious extremists clash with it. Al-Qaida and Westboro Christians somehow manage to join forces to attack wizards by crashing plane. A ghost so old he sees Jesus as a relatively recent event becomes a public figure and struggles with the concept of three different Abrahamistic religions. Voldemort gives Al-Qaida nukes. Atlantean documents reveal that Noah's flood was apparently the result of an asteroid impact in the ocean causing a tsunami, and middle eastern wizards did a massive project to build several giant boats. Judgement Day comes and goes. The cult of the Black God causes some trouble too.
