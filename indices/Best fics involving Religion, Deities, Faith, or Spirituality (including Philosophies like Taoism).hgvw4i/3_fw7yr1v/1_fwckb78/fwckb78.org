Huh. That's quite interesting. I've seen the obvious hyper-Christians integrated into HP (everything from "homosexuality causes Squibs" to "we're all secretly Catholics!"), but never anything from the Jewish faith. Especially interesting, given Jewish views on magic being quite situationally complex and Christianity's views on Jewish magic commonly causing tension and rising to persecution.

Thanks for the rec!
