Do you remember the chapter where they had a kiss? I checked the Yule Ball and First Challenge scenes and the furthest Viktor goes with Hermione is asking her to dance and inviting her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer.

  "He asked me right after he'd pulled me out of the lake," Hermione muttered. "After he'd got rid of his shark's head. Madam Pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they wouldn't hear, and he said, if I wasn't doing anything over the summer, would I like to---"

  "And he did say he'd never felt the same way about anyone else," Hermione went on, going so red now that Harry could almost feel the heat coming from her.

If there's off-screen kissing, then I doubt that it would have happened during GoF, considering Hermione at that point in the books couldn't even discuss her feelings about Viktor without being overwhelmed with embarrassment.
