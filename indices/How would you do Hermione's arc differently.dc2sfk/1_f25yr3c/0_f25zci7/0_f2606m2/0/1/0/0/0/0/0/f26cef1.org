I just checked my books, and there's an unaccounted for gap of about a month in OotP, when Ron and Hermione are ignoring Harry's mail. Harry goes from Hogwarts at the end of GoF to Privet Drive, and stays there out of communication with everyone else until he gets his Ministry warning letter, which sets the hearing date at 12 August.

Ron and Hermione couldn't have been at Grimmauld Place for long, since by the time Harry arrives, they're still cleaning the house and making it livable. For all we know, Hermione /could/ have visited Krum during that time, since we never got a definitive confirmation that she had accepted his invitation.
