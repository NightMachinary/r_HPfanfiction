I may be wrong but I'm pretty sure that Hermione is accounted for during most if not all of the holidays after GoF and before the wedding, it obviously didn't happen during the school year so it really only could have been during that year (and if it did I'm pretty sure it was never mentioned in the books).

But I also happen to agree with you that Hermione in GoF really couldn't have "snogged" Krum, maybe there was a small peck on the lips at the end of the night but not much more than that.

My theory/headcanon regarding that quote from HBP is that Ginny is simply trying to get on Ron's nerves (and maybe getting him to hurry up and admit he's attracted to Hermione), something that I feel would be totally in character for her. Maybe Hermione told her about the small kiss that I believe could have happened and she exaggerated it for effect or she heard it from a rumour and everyone just took it as a fact that they snogged.
