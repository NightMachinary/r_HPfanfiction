  Ron looked round at her so fast he appeared to crick his neck. Rubbing it, he said, "Yeah? What did Vicky say? You're not still in contact with him, are you?"

  "And Hermione snogged Viktor Krum, it's only you who acts like it's something disgusting, Ron, and that's because you've got about as much experience as a twelve-year-old!"

So Hermione was 16/17 while he was 19/20. So it's not /that/ disgusting considering they must have been long-distance dating for 2 years at that point.
