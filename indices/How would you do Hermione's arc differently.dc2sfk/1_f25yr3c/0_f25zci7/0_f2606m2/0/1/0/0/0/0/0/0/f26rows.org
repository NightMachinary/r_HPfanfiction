We never get to see much Hermione's parents, but I find it very unlikely that the parents of a 14/15 year old girl would let her travel (alone or not) from the UK to Bulgaria to spend time with an 18 year old international sports star, especially when they already only have less than 4 months a year to spend with her. I doubt she even asked her parents about it, I know I wouldn't. Regarding the quote of her telling Harry about the invitation, the way I read it, all the blushing is because she is pretty excited that a hot guy just asked her to visit him abroad during the holidays and basically says that he loves her (even though they seem to have few interactions and at one point which I'm pretty sure was after the Yule Ball and maybe before the 2nd Task Hermione says that most of the time they spend together is just him staring at her in the library, that might be cute for established couples but for two people who barely know each other?). I'm pretty sure that after her hormones started calming down she realized that the trip really wouldn't work, maybe if they started by being pen pals and they still felt the same in a few years they could give it a try, but while she is still in school and highly dependent of her parents? No way.

If by some miracle she did manage to go to Bulgaria Hermione doesn't seem the kind of person to just spend a month snogging someone and then go back to her life like nothing happened. So in that scenario I see one of two things happening, either they decide to give a long distance relationship a try (because Krum "has never felt this way about anyone else", which as an aside is something I would expect to hear from a 14/15 year old definitely not Krum but moving on), this clearly didn't happen, or they decided to stay friends and pen pals... and you get the idea same thing as if she realized this really wouldn't work before even trying to go to Bulgaria. Then again maybe I think that Hermione is more level headed than most other people do.

I understand that some people like this idea of a romance between the two of them and I find no issue with it if developed differently in fanfiction (although my personal opinion of him in canon is that he is really creepy, in case it wasn't obvious, and as such I tend to steer clear of fanfics that pair the two of them).

Bringing it back to the original point of adding to Hermione's arc I always found that maybe if Cedric and Harry had a closer friendship during GoF, he or more likely one of his friends could have filled the role of Hermione's first romantic interest/crush much better. If I remember correctly Cedric was actually a 6th year who had his 17th birthday before the selection of champions and as such Hermione and this imaginary friend of Cedric could take their time with their relationship (because he has one more year at Hogwarts), since he's from the UK they might even be able to meet during the holidays.

Now when it comes to endgame pairings I'll be upfront and say I prefer Harry/Hermione over pretty any other, a small part of it being because if we have to pick from the major characters that interact with Hermione, seeing as really aside from Harry the only others that have a half decent relationship with her are Ron and Krum (and I don't like either of their relationships with her, if others do good for them but I don't) or maybe one of the Weasley twins which could actually be fun, but while they seem free spirited I always got the impression that from GoF forward they were both pretty steady with Angelina and Alicia so why ruin a good thing?

I'm not going to say the endgame pairing should be HHr simply because it is my personal favorite, so if we stick to canon and say it will be Romione we might have some conflict there during OoP because of it (Ron being jealous as usual). Maybe the parents of Cedric's friend work for the ministry or something and he doesn't quite believe Harry about Voldemort, or believes but doesn't want to get involved and tries to get Hermione to stay away from Harry during that year, which spells doom for their relationship. This in my opinion would have allowed us to see a different side of Hermione (her being a normal teenager with a crush that actually goes somewhere) and her choosing to stick with her friends because not only is her relationship with them more important to her but what they are doing (the DA in OoP) and fighting Voldemort in the future is worth the price of letting go of this guy.

God, I can't believe I just spent this long thinking about this when I find it to be a pretty unintersting subplot of the story. I'll just end by saying this is my opinion of Hermione's character and circumstances in the story, I definitely accept that things could be totally different to someone else simply because they think the decisions made by the characters in the background were different (since almost none of this is ever stated explicitly). I just wrote all of this to explain where I'm coming from and not to say you're wrong to have your opinion.
