Also, and correct me if I'm wrong, I don't believe that Lupin ever expresses any legitimate interest in Tonks. He agrees to the relationship (and to marriage, like, a month later) because she badgers him until he does (and is that ever a situation that would look even more unwholesome were their ages and/or genders reversed), but he never really seems to enjoy her company or have any particular interest in her as a person.
