  It's not just Remus for caving in. You need 2 people for a relationship and Tonks provided the impetus.

Yes, but unless both sides want the relationship, it will not happen. Believe me when I say that just wanting a relationship will not magically make the other person want the same. So no matter how hard, for some reason, Tonks wanted Lupin's ass, he was the one making the call.
