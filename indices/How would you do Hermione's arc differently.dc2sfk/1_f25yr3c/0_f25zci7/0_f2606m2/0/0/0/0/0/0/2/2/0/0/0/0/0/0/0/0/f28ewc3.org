Knock her up and do a runner?

That would be somewhat more understandable from an 18-year old man than from someone aged 37. Still a massive dick move, but I have more sympathy for the guy who just turned 18.

Kept annoying her about dates and possibly more?

Depends on how annoying he is, but I doubt that Hermione wouldn't find a way to get the message across as she has a vicious side (eg everlasting howlers, or worse if he gets physically annoying/threatening).

Also, she does not have the benefit of being able to avoid McLaggen as they sleep a few yards from each other and generally have to spend a lot of time together. Lupin could simply put his flat under the Fidelius (seems to be a smart choice either way) and avoid Tonks entirely if things really was that bad.
