Tonks, in OotP, was probably the coolest background character because she was the only adult in high spirits despite Voldemort's return. Then Rowling completly ruined that by reducing her to a lovesick idiot and a pawn in the Molly/Fleur feud. Yet she was very sympathetic in OotP. Lupin doesn't even has that.

The last two books have atrocious characterisations all across the board save maybe Snape and Dumbledore due to narrator bias.
