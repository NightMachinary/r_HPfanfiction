That's why I hated Krum's appearance (and character assassination) at the wedding scene in the books. Viktor is 18 and Hermione is 15 in GoF, and both were students at the time, which is unusual but not unheard of in the real world between high school students. Based on what little we saw of the relationship, it was fairly innocent stuff, going to the library, a date to the Yule Ball, penpals over the summer.

Krum at the wedding is a full-grown adult man with a career, acting like an arrogant, entitled whinger. No thank you.

It's funny that the DH Part 1 movie kept [[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0b/c2/fc/0bc2fca571a556671da28aeaab073c9b.jpg][Krum as a gentleman]] in the wedding scene, but his appearance didn't make the final cut.
