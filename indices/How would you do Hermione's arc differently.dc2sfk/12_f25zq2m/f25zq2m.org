I would change Hermione becoming friends with Harry and Ron after the troll incident. Like the teachers instead of awarding points given them detention for not following the instructions, Hermione decides to stay away from Ron and Harry, becomes bit humble and hangs out with the other girls in her form or Neville. She is still smart, stands up with Neville when Ron and Harry go to face Quirellmort because she doesn't want Gryffindor to lose more points.

In second year, she gets petrified but still she figured out about the basilisk all by herself. Lavender and Parvati find the crumpled note in her hand sooner and show it to Madam Pomfrey, who notifies McGonagall. The chamber entrance is sealed and Ginny is never captured. Mrs Weasley suspects something wrong with Ginny over the holidays and Diary Horcrux is discovered.

Third year- Her cat still "eats" scabbers, she doesn't care about the firebolt because she doesn't know that Sirius is after Harry who is anyway not her friend. She figures out Lupin is a werewolf and tells her friends making him resign earlier and Pettigrew never escapes.

Fourth year- would be AU because no Peter - no Bertha jorkins- no creepy babymort - no rescuing Barty crouch Jr- Harry not part of Triwizard and cheers Cedric along with everyone else- Cedric doesn't die. Would be interesting how Voldie makes a comeback.
