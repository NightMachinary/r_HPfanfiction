  I believe OP is trying to make Hermione into a better person

Lol i mean in a way yes. I guess its more that 2 out of 3 of the major characters got growth through an actual character arc and Hermione didn't and that feels unfair.

Im not opposed to making her become more dark and harsh for a period but i dont think shes a cruel character over all like the Remus suggestion...doesnt seem in character. I do think that making her maybe a friend but not best friend after the troll thing could work though. Have her feel like a third wheel until maybe fouth year and then she finally feels equal in friendship.
