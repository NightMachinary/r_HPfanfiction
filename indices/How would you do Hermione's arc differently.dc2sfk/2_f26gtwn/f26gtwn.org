I'd put more emphasis on her ruthlessness later on. The fifth book sets this up perfectly, first with the cursed list and later where she tries to get Umbridge squashed by a giant. But in HBP, you see none of that. Remember what happened when they suspected that Malfoy might know something in CoS? HBP means veritaserum time.

I'd also put more emphasis on Umbridge in DH, so you have Hermione do more in that regard because she found the Holocaust parallels more obvious than the other two.

Maybe even an arc where she struggles with morality as difficult times require harsh measures to ensure success.

As for romances, you'd get the most character growth out of Hermione/Lavender because she'd have to own up to her past mistakes.
