If you want to write it, then I would argue quite strongly against “retelling whole canon with some changes of mine”. I am just not able to read yet-another ninety-plus chapters of the same stuff while carefully looking for minuscule changes author made. It is just too boring. Make a new story. Not completely AU universe, just write something we don't know about. JKR left so much unexplained and empty, so write just that part which you want to make different or which is missing. E.g., when reading linkao3(17777138) or linkffn(9566537) there are just parts authors wanted to have different, and it is interesting. Or go post-War or pre-Hogwart. Just make your own original story. Most readers of fanfiction know JKR stories by heart (mostly), we may not want to read it again from somebody who is not Ms. Rowling.

Specifically Hermione, it is difficult. Her character was so beaten to death, there is not much to explore. I would specifically warn against Harmony. Story where the major part of originality is that she is with Harry and not with Ron are really difficult, because they tend to end with Mary Sue/Marty Sue two perfect flawless characters which are just happily cooing together and my eyes go automatically to sleep.

The only sensible thing to do (if you are keeping yourself in the canonical timeframe) is to find something which Ms. Rowling didn't write well in the books. And there is really little about Hermione generally which is wrong (oh, yes, I forgot, sending parents to Australia, right).

So, yes, romantic relationships (because Ms. Rowling [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][cannot write a romantic relationship to get herself out of a wet paper bag]], and see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HarryandGinny/comments/ceiyfj/the_character_development_of_ginny_weasley/exg9nzn/][the linked thread here on the Reddit]]) are probably the only major story-worthy things to change about Hermione. If you want to keep Romione than what about making them more sensible and starting dating earlier? Some kind of Ron/Lavender-like disaster around the Yule Ball (yes, we all did some really stupid mistakes in love, which hurt somebody and us), and then coming to their senses and getting together in OotP time-frame? Or get out of the Gryffindor common room (that's always a good strategy in my opinion) and make Hermione find her intellectual equal somewhere among Ravenclaws (I am always rooting for the secular-Jewish Hermione, so what about her with Anthony Goldstein, he is as blank page in canon as Daphne Greengrass?). Or how many good Dramione pre-War and even pre-HBP stories there are? Or if she was (and why she wouldn't be?) one of many many girls at Hogwarts making puppy eyes after Cedric Diggory (I love linkao3(The Dream Diary by MandyinKC)), why not to make lovely tragic story out of it? Or even make him survive? Non-Romione pairing allow happy Ron/Lavender couple, which is another thing I would love to read more about (they could fit together very well, if they stop snogging and start talking, and how many of us did the same mistake?).
