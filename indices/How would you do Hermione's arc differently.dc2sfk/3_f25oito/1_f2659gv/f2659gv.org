I don't think she needs an academic rival, but she needs someone other than Harry to be the best at a subject. For example, Harry wins DADA, Neville is probably top in Herbology, not that anyone cares, and Hermione is top in every other subject. That feels inauthentic, and honestly pretty sad for the Ravenclaws. Hermione having to deliberately sacrifice more of her academic goals for her friends would have been a good moment for her.

But also yes Hermione just needs friends. Ron has his family, and he interacts with the other boys in the dorm. We really don't see Hermione interact with all that many people. A friendship with Ginny, a study partner who likes studying, actual romance with Krum -- all would have helped.
