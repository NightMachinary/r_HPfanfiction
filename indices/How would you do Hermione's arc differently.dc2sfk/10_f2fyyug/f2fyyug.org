Hermione would believe Harry when he says that Draco "I hate mudbloods" Malfoy is a up to something in HBP!

She would also be much closer to Harry (make him study more, point out Ron's flaws etc.) and she would (in time) learn to have fun (yes, she likes studying, but it isn't exactly fun or relaxing!)

There would be no snitching to the teachers about brooms either and not ignoring that her beast of a cat tries to eat Ron's rat (note: Why didn't the monster try it earlier? Did she only get the beast that year? Damned, I forgot!)

Hermione would also realize that Harry was abused, something I doubt she ever realized in canon (at least she doesn't act like it! Hell, she's Dumbledore's mouthpiece a lot of times, when in reality she should despise the old meddler for what he did to Harry!)
