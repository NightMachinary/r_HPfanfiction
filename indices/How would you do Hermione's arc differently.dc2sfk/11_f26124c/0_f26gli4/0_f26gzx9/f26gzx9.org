Well that is completely true. It is very unfair and kinda sends a bad message across, especially granted that Draco Malfoy's point of view was never deeply explored and there are too many fanciful conjectures that try to justify him. There are very few scenarios where I can see even a littlest of scopes for a redemption arc. But it doesn't change the fact that it would interesting if someone managed to pull off an arc, where if not romantically involved with each other, they at least move a something closer to a cordial friendship, after of course a harsh and painful reconcilation.
