Do you mean the tent thing in DH?

Ron left because he had a family to go back to. Hermione can't do that because she burned her own bridges, mind-wiping her family and sending them to Australia.

It would be more realistic if Hermione had an idea that she believed was good during the Horcrux Hunt, argued the boys down when they disagreed with her, pointing to her track record of "Look how many times I was right". Then she turns out to be disastrously wrong in a way that she can't blame anyone else but herself for it.

It has to be a legitimate mistake on Hermione's part, and not contrived nonsense like the Taboo that no one conveniently told them about until it was too late.
