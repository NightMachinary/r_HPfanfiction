Huh i mean i have been seeing more of it. I guess if i had to guess the reason is that Hermione being depicted as having little flaws and being badass is more common and people want to see her being occasionally more flaws issues things to overcome that come from internal rather than external flaws.

And maybe people feel the narrative might be too nice to her at times. Which is to say her issues suffer fewer consequences in comparison to others like Ron and Harry over similar issues at times too. Even if she doesnt grow that is kinda unfair.

But i guess Social issues specifically is a easier target so its emphasized more.

Im curious if its not social issues and you wanted a arc based on working on her flaws and improving them what would you do?
