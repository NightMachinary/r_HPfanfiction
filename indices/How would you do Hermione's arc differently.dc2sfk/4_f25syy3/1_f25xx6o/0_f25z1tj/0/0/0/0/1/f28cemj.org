Mmh i guess its not so much I want her to be nicer( not sure for anyone else only speaking for myself). What I do want for her is character change and growth that comes from conequences related to her struggles and flaws. So you have an aspect of her personality that caused problems for her in relationships but not explored well and had little in the way of consequence. So there is room for growth there and room for an arc which she doesnt really get in the books beyond the first. Which is unfair cuz Ron and Harry do.
