True. The thing here is that Hermione as a character is effectively perfect except for the single flaw of lacking niceness. And for a character to have a growth arc, they need to face challenges to their flaws and overcome them. So it's really the only place for her to grow.

If there's a character who is not nice but also not trusting, for example, they can stay not nice through their whole arc while still growing in handling their trust issues. That's still a satisfying arc. (Wolverine in Marvel comes to mind as someone who goes through multiple arcs like this, and being nice is never really touched on because he has so many other issues to explore.)

The alternative is to give her other failings and make arcs out of them. Like her inability to think under pressure that was in the books and not the movies. She could recognize her weak point and train to think laterally instead of literally and to think on her feet. That would be less satisfying than a character issue like empathy (which is worthy of a secondary character), but it would at least be an arc worthy of a tertiary character.
