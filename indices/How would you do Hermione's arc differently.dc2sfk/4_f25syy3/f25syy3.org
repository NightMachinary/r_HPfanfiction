The problem with Hermione is that her entire character revolves around being the deliverer of exposition. She has to be right in order to move the plot along and help Harry solve the mystery of the year. For her character to learn humility and empathy, Hermione would have to make a huge and destructive mistake, because just being /told/ that she's rude and pushy wouldn't teach her anything. And a plot-derailing mistake would never happen because JKR had that "All Was Well" ending planned from the start, and Hermione was always her self-insert, wish-fulfillment character.

So what we're left with is a Hermione who is only willing to learn something from other people if she's aware of what she lacks, and since she's not a self-reflective character, there's not much that she actually thinks she lacks. With school and books, she pays attention because she wants knowledge. With letting Harry teach DADA with Dumbledore's Army, it's because Harry has the hands on experience.

  "Harry," she said timidly, "don't you see? This... this is exactly why we need you... we need to know what it's r-really like... facing him... facing V-Voldemort."

Things that she actually lacks, eg. Divinating abilities, femininity, likeability, and open-mindedness, are traits she rationalizes as unimportant. And her lack of them are only ever tangentially important to the main plot of the books, like the completely irrelevant SPEW subplot.

*TL;DR* - Hermione's arc depends on her making a major mistake. She fucks up hugely, and there are plot-relevant /consequences/ for it, not just brushed aside like Hermione taking Harry's Firebolt in PoA, and it was okay, because it was never jinxed in the first place. Harry learned consequences when he ran to the DoM trying to rescue Sirius, while everyone kept telling him it was a trap. Hermione needs a "come to Jesus" moment on a similar scale of importance.
