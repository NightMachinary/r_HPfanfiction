I would have a few things happen

1) make it very clear that Hermione is perfect in her non wanded classes, but in classes that require Magic, she takes a bit to get the spells, yes she still beats most people to cast the spell but over all she isn't a 1 in a life time magical talent because "Books"

2) She clear and visibly loses her trust in most authority figures. In other words no correcting Harry on calling Snape Professor Snape after he insults her teeth. Or she ignores the instinct to trust that Dumbledore knows what he's doing in year 6 and listens to Harry.

3) Hermione actually dating people and perhaps even Harry at some time. They don't need to get together but, the characters are done a disservice by having such chemistry and love and yet it's quickly relegated to a sibling relationship. Hermione is also the most outspoken about rights and what is and isn't correct You would expect her to be someone who isn't afraid of Molly Weasley's "Scarlet Woman" title

4) I would have Hermione kill the Minister of Magic during the final battle or another character of high standing title wise like a Teacher or the Head of a Major Department of the Ministry. Complete the turn from teachers pet to girl over throwing the System. Yes she will likely eventually take over that position in a few years but in that moment she isn't thinking about laws and proper rules, she sees a Monster and she Kills it.
