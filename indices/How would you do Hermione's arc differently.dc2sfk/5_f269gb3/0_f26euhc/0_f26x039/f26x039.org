Unless your dying for Ron to be out of the picture ehh I'm thinking more something that will weigh on her

She could be the one that allows for Peter to escape like they were about to stun him and a few other curses and spells and Hermione begged them to calm down as they were acting like a bunch of rabid dogs. This leads to Peter escaping like in canon but this time it falls on Hermiones head. Now every time she sees Sirius or Harry and Sirius together she has to remember the reason they both can't be happy is because she had sympathy for the man that got Harry's Parents killed. She would also see herself responsible for all of Book 4 aka Cedric
