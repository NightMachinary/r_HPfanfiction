But seriously, most the posts---and the fics---seem to want her to be nicer, better adjusted, more restrained, and there seems to be this preoccupation with teaching her a lesson to be more considerate of other people (i.e., put the b!$# in her place). To be a more stereotypical part of a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoGuysAndAGirl][Two Guys and a Girl Trope]], in other words.

And that's boring.

I'd play up what makes Hermione an interesting character in the first place: make her the full-on Anti-Hero of the group. Pile consequences of her actions on her bushy-haired head, sure; but rather than having her decide to be more restrained next time, have her decide to be sneakier instead. What Harry and Ron don't know can't hurt them. You're only in trouble if you get caught. Memory Chars, Legilimency, Confundus, and Occlumency are the best spells for avoiding that. The ends justify the means. Dark Arts... are probably still too dangerous to practice without an expert to supervise you, but it's important to know the theory, just in case.

I want Harry to be worried about sharing Half-Blood Prince's Potions book with Hermione, because of how she might use the knowledge in it. I want Harry and Ron to learn that Dolohov and Throwle have both died of a mysterious illness or just committed suicide a few months after Hermione obliviated them at the diner---and have a debate about whether or not to talk to Hermione about it.
