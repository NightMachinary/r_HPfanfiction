I think part of it is that due to her position (the booksmart of the trio), she has to be right on a lot of things to act as exposition. But I'm not sure I agree with you on her never making stupid mistakes or being wrong.

For example, she's got a much stronger regard for authority than the other two - that's much of what happens with the reports to McGonagall. She tends to believe what's in books - like with Lockhart, and believing him to be an amazing figure. She can't handle being surpassed/being disappointing - it's why she struggles with the Boggart in PoA and part of why she dislikes the Half-Blood Prince's book.

But you're right that she doesn't tend to be too wrong - and that's because she tends to play that role of convincing exposition. To an extent, the more wrong she gets, the less the reader will believe her words moving forward - so Rowling didn't want to make her wrong too often on that sort of exposition, particularly since most everything is supposed to be solved by the trio. Personally I'm not sure that I agree with you on her getting less comeuppance/growth than Ron, but that's just my impression of their characters - and the back half of the series is not always as clear to me in my memory.

I think the way someone could change her arc with the trio is to focus on a few changes. First, her relationship with authority. Yes, she does have some times she goes against it, but I'd like to see more situations where her going to the professors is actually a problem. I'd also want to see SPEW actually examined /reasonably/ and to have it more fleshed out than just played for laughs/annoying/happy slave trope. That could play well with the authority angle - all the authority figures seem happy/content with the enslaved house elves and push back against her efforts for greater representation (her initial goal was /very/ minor with the house elves, as a reminder).

The second change I'd slot in is to change the nature of her knowledge/role as exposition. She can be a bookworm of course, and able to dig up obscure aspects and spells and history and whatnot. But a way to make her /less/ always perfect is to have someone else fill that role for modern wizarding society - eg, if keeping the trio together, having /Ron/ be the one to be a window into the modern wizarding world, its mores, its laws, its celebrities, etc.
