I think the main flaw in Hermione's arc in the books is that she doesn't ever really have a moment of growth in the way Harry or Ron do. The boys both, over the course of the series, make stupid mistakes and hurt other people, and then either realize their misdeed or get called on it by another character, and then grow. Not so with Hermione, who, even when she is wrong, is right.

As a quick example of this, consider PoA. There are two events in particular I have in mind. The first is when Harry receives the Firebolt and Hermione reports it to McGonagall because she expects it's probably from Sirius Black. The three have a tiff over this and Harry and Ron refuse to talk to Hermione until Hagrid tells them what bad friends they're being and they forgive her. The second is when Scabbers is missing, assumed dead, in that same book, and she and Ron are fighting because she doesn't really care about how it affects him. In both of these circumstances, Hermione was /right/ -- the firebolt *was* sent by Sirius Black, and Crookshanks was *right* to chase Scabbers. However, the ways in which she mishandled these situations, and was wrong in them -- namely, by not understanding or caring about the emotions of others -- are never addressed, she never grows, and her techinical correctness about both events feels like the narrative pardoning her her faults.

So, if I were to change her arc at all, it would be to give her some sort of comeuppance followed by growth into a more empathetic character. Since it doesn't seem likely she would realize this about herself, it would probably have to be in the form of being called out by Harry or Ron, or perhaps her parents. Prime places to insert such a scene would be with regards to her treatment of Luna, who she always disdains (this was an arc Harry underwent in OotP, from thinking Luna was nuts to understanding that she can be odd and awkward and still the only person you want to talk to after your godfather dies), or perhaps her treatment of Lavender and Ron in HBP (violence and verbal cruelty as an expression of jealousy is not a good look, even if Ron and Lavender were not a wonderful match), or her memory-wiping of her parents in DH.

I don't really have a preference of which of these to have it happen about, but obviously doing one earlier would effect later events. I just wish she had had a chance to show character growth in the same way the other main characters did. The fact that by the end of DH she didn't kinda makes her feel less complete, or less central to the books than Harry and Ron, which is a bit of a snub imo, and makes me wish for more.

So that'd be my thought! What about you, OP?
