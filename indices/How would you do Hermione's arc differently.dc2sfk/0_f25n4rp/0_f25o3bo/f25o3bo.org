Honestly I have the same exact problem. And what really frustrates me is it sounds like a very interesting narrative. For her to struggle with relationships and learn to become better at understanding others, expressing herself and interpersonal relationships would be a great arc thats not the most common. I wish it was in canon or at least more fanfic. I'd love to hear what specific changes you'd make. Personnally id start with Hermione not instantly becoming friends after the troll incident.
