Yeah, it's nothing magical. It's centuries of conditioning and more or less breeding that's left the house elves with deeply ingrained instincts and culture to serve. Dobby is an oddity in that he doesn't feel beholden to that culture, but rather to heroes (and himself, to a slight extent) instead. Even Dobby still suffers from the ingrained instincts though - once he's free he wants to keep working, he just wants it on his terms. He even haggled for less pay and less time off.

As far as S.P.E.W goes it's something that would take generations itself to achieve true success. If Hermione were to make a true empathic attempt at achieving anything with it, it'd start off with treatment of house elves instead of freeing them. Once house elves actually accept that abuse by their owners isn't acceptable, then the issue of paying them can come around. After that freedom could be considered, but the elves would more or less become contracted servants at that point rather than truly free. It's a good stepping point for slowly making them equal members of society, though.
