Oh I agree with that. I think we were on different pages here, sorry, my bad (I blame posting late without properly reading). Trying to free the elves like she did was unattainable and counterproductive in canon, which was the point Rowling was trying to make at the time. Her heart was in the right place.

The issue is even with it being only psychological after the elves are freed, having the elves decide to drink themselves to death is not an ideal solution. It's not just the stigma, but something has them bound to obey until they're freed. Then it's just conditioning.

But her trying to give elves she didn't own clothes was detrimental to her entire campaign and frankly was disgustingly naive and short-sighted.
