Actually, house elves aren't a good example, because they are so thoroughly controlled by their owners that their expressed wishes have little to no moral weight. They have to do and say whatever they are ordered to do and say.

The fact that Hogwarts elves are probably treated better than average only mildly alters that. Winky makes it clear that their enslavement has permeated and infected their entire culture, and Dobby demonstrated that even after a year of freedom from masters he hated, his conditioning was still in effect, causing him to punish himself for criticising them.

"House elves don't want to be free" is a very weak and suspect argument.
