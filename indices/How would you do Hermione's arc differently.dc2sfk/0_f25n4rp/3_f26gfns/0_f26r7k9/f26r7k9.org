The first book was one where she showed definitive growth I think and you get a monent in the last one with Ron the " are you a wizard or not?" In reference to are you a witch or not. But it is more moments than a fully fledged arc like what Harry and Ron had and its kinda unfair she is the only one of the main 3 who didn't have it.
