I would have given her a different ending in PoA. No one really talks about how a 14 yr old third year manages to convince their head of house and headmaster to willingly give them a Time Turner JUST for the ability to take divination and muggle studies along with her other 3 core classes.

That right there tells me how much that thought wasn't thought totally through. She needed some kind of punishment. Who the hell didn't notice her all year attending all classes and didn't ask any questions or notice her carry it around, or use it, or see her in one hallway or in another 10s later. I just don't buy it.

She needs to invoke some kind of punishment. Either a mishap with the device that affects her negativity. (Loss of classes, official minister punishment, suspension for x years, a huge fine her parents have to pay but can't and it forces them to move away and become not super rich dentists who live in a nice house and take vacations every year and who manages to completely forget to call her best friend or visit him every year((give me a break)). I would also be ok with something terrible happening to harry or sirius when they do go back in time. Maybe he dies, maybe harry gets his soul sucked out.. I mean he does have two. Maybe one of them get a mortal wound and they never forgive her.
