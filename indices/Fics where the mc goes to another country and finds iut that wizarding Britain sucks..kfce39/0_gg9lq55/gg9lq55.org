I'd say Rowling for one thing. She paints Britain -horribly-. :)

But other than that, Power of the Press by Bobmin for one. Other countries have magical universities while Britain only has apprenticeships with all the negatives that entails. And some other stuff. Bobmin's X-Men Crossover also has that, as I recall.
