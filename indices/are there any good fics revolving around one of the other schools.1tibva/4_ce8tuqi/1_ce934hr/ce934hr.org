I started reading "A Second Chance at Life" (got through maybe ~3 chapters) and couldn't continue because there was just not enough detail for me, and it made Harry into a genius extremely fast (like around one chapter?). It might be that it's just my personal taste, but would you say the style of writing changes as the fic goes on?
