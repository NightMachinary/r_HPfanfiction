It's a weird fic, to be honest, and definitely not to everyone's tastes. The author is undisciplined, introducing new magical systems at the drop of a hat (blood magic, thread magic, feather magic, multiple schools of necromancy, vampires Ã¼ber alles, etc.) and while the story gets technically better (and abandons most stereotypes several chapters in, taking many creative turns), it is still very polarizing and pretty much isn't even "Harry in name only" anymore once he takes on the moniker Rakhesh Asmodeus.
