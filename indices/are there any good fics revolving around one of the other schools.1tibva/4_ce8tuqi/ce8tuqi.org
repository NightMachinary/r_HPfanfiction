It's a bit infamous, but Miranda Flairgold's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][A Second Chance at Life]] and sequels have Harry training at a Canadian school of assassins.

The Mad Mad Reviewer's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool]] makes frequent allusions to Arkham Academy, a school Harry attended in his previous life.

Darth Marrs's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son][Firebird Trilogy]] has reference to several other magical schools.

It's an old story (2005) and hasn't aged well, but Naia's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2400483/1/Anarkia][Anarkia]] was among of the first of this type.
