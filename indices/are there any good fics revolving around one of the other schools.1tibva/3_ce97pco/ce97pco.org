Miranda Flairgold's series, which has already been mentioned, is by far my favourite stories in this direction. Others that come to mind are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1779719/1/][Harry Potter and the Marcello School of Magic]] Complete. Harry goes to a warrior school after 5th year, he discovers an array of new powers, makes new friends and enemies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3771102/1/][Harry Potter and the Irish Choice]] A relatively short (60K) story where Harry goes to another school instead of Hogwarts at the start of his education. Spans 4 years and is complete

Another one of my favorite stories is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5238750/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Antiquity-Link][Harry Potter and the Antiquity Link]], This is set Post Hogwarts and Post Voldemort, and not really focussed around him going to an alternate school. But he does attend a school in japan for a while and the story expands a lot of differences between the british and japanese magical world and what implications this has in the school environment.
