fair warning for the last one he doesn't actually travel to japan until midway into the story, so if the start of the isn't what you had in mind, sorry. But it really is a fantastic fanfic in my opinion. It explores the japanese magic culture in way that is not only interesting but makes sense in the context of japanese society in the real world.
