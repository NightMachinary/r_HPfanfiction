I'm not sure, it probably progresses to over a half year of Dieter's first year? I don't remember since it's been a while since I last read it. What I really liked about the story was the juxtaposition of Dieter's Nazi-instilled prejudices and the anti-muggle prejudices of a lot of the wizards around him (Dieter is a muggle-born, which makes it even more interesting to me).
