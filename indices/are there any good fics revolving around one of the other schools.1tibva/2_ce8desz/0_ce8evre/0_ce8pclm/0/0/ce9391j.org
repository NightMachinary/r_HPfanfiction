I agree, I love that kind of detail! Though it isn't a fic about another wizarding school, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] does have some pretty original ideas about WWII/Grindelwald/pureblood ideology, etc. The author even threw some mention/analysis of the London bombings in too, I believe. It's an amazing fic (though depending on your tastes, it'll take 'til around chapter 3 to really get into it). It is AU - 7th year and possibly 6th year don't occur as they did in the books, Harry loses to Voldemort, he goes back in time to the Marauder era (I /love/ this part!), and the main pairing is HarryxBellatrix. So I recommend that fic too, even though it's not exactly what you're looking for.

Another person also mentioned the Alexandra Quick series, so I second that. That series is amazing.
