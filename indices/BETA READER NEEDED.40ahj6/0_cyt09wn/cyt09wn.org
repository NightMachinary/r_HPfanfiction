If I were you, I'd post a couple of chapters somewhere so people can see if your story will suit them. I've been asked to beta stories before, only to discover I don't like the characters, think the story is directionless drivel, and that I wouldn't trust the author to write stuff for the back of breakfast cereal packets.

On the other hand, if there's a story I like, I've come close to begging to be allowed to beta it (ask Starfox5!) if I think I can help make it even slightly better.

Your story doesn't sound like one for me; I think Harry Potter stories should be about Harry Potter - at least to a large extent. But posting a couple of chapters may get you someone who thinks differently.
