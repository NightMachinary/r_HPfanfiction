Can't say I can recommend [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2560219/Dethryl][Dethryl's]] fics as I've never read them (the author has come off as an arrogant toerag in one of the forums I used to haunt), but Bulwersator's recommendation is probably the classic one of this type.

One I do recommend is Mede's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4810036/1/On-a-Train-Switching-Tracks][On a Train, Switching Tracks]], one of the more surreal stories out there. 21k words, a series of self-contained snippets.

  First year: "Celebrities," Harry said. "Fame makes them mad. I take it the wizarding world doesn't really have them, then?" Draco and Ron exchanged glances. "No, not really." AU, assorted oneshots and snippets.

Another good one is Lulu42's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4438449/5/Path-of-Decision][Path of Decision]]. 250k words, complete. You don't really need to know Gaiman's /Sandman/ to enjoy it, but a quick peek at the wiki might help give a sense of things. I don't know why, but I just really enjoy the writing style.

  Voldemort is in power, but the Wizarding World fights back. Harry Potter, Master of Death, is faced with a choice, move forward or change everything? Sandman Crossover
