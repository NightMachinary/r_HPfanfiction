This one has an eventual Harry/Draco first year friendship, though they're not besties. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3736151/1/Better-Be-Slytherin]]

Harry/Draco first year friendship; they're close-ish but not besties. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The_Best_Revenge]]

Link to the Switchverse, where Fred & George Confund the Sorting Hat in Harry's year with very interesting results. The one-shot sequels in the series span books 1-3. Features Hufflepuff!Harry and Draco as best buds, a Ravenclaw!Ron (who is my favourite thing ever), and multiple other interesting Sortings. [[http://corvidae9.livejournal.com/344634.html]]
