Well, it isn't the main focus, it doesn't have that exact start (he doesn't get sorted into Slytherin...sort of), and it isn't a sappy friendship or romance fic, but [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][Methods of Rationality]] does have them as uneasy friends and allies. That also happens really early on in the first year. It is a really, really huge fic though.

How anyone on the planet hasn't read that fic by now is beyond me, so that might not help you or anyone else much. But there is always a chance someone has managed to not read it by now.
