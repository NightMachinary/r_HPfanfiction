I guess it depends entirely on the execution. What annoys me about that brand of Hermione fics is that her dominance isn't limited to the relationship but she restructures Harry's entire life and significantly changes him. And that's the kind of fic which gets the beta complaints.

However, if you have a woman ask a guy out because she's interested and then decides to move things along, the common reaction to the guy would be something along the lines of "what a lucky bastard". And honestly, I can't think of a single fic where Harry is the pursued throughout the romance arc.
