Words change, especially words that only exist on the internet, like Simp. It went from referring to parasocial guys who give female streamers absurd amounts of money to be noticed to being used as a word for anyone who is vaguely nice or deferential to a woman.

It may have originally been a nuanced word, but by now it's just a tool to demean guys who aren't as sexist as the guy saying it.
