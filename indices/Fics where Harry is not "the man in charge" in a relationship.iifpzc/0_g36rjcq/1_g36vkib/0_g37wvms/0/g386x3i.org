That is... not what a simp is. The word is generally used to refer to men who have a parasocial relationship with a female content creator (YouTube/Twitch/etc). It is typified not by niceness but by entitlement, stalkerish behaviour, obsession, etc. Just watch what happens when simps turn on their favoured content creator because e.g. she won't post nudes - they are definitely /not/ nice people, but much more like a variety of incel.
