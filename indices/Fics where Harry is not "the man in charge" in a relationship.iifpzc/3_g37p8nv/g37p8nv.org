In my Haphne stories, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7037925/1/Living-Dangerously][Living Dangerously]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13341726/1/Living-in-Secret][Living in Secret]] , Harry ends up accidentially filling a more submissive role than usual. Daphne is simply more dominant than him, and he gets a shameful amount of satisfaction from her unexpectedly putting him in his place. And then likewise, there's a similar dynamic when he finally puts his foot down and takes charge of her instead. I write their relationship with an underlying competition of who is the rightful dominant one, which (I feel, anyway) gives a much higher feeling of justification in their feelings for each other than I typically read in other fics.

Behind every King is a Queen who has him wrapped around her little finger - there arent many guys out there, even the domonant ones, who won't do anything their woman asks of them. Admitting this and portraying it in fictional relationships gives adds a more realistic aspect than what we typically see in fantasy relationships.
