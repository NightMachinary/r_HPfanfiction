By saying that a guy not being "in charge" makes him into a wimp. While yes, you may not have said that the other way is natural, it still came across as such, which is why you were downvoted and I made my comment. Let me explain.

Yes, both parties should be equal in power. However, "in power" refers to agency, not mindset. A relationship can have a dominant and a submissive member and yet still both sides can be equal in power. They both still have agency over their lives.

What you did in your original comment was assume that "in charge" meant agency (which is deductible from your response to my comment) and then specified that a guy not being "in charge" meant that he was a wimp. In so doing and neglecting to take into account the non-agency based power structure that is always 100% voluntary (as agency enables exit), you implicitly said that a guy who doesn't want to be dominant is a wimp, thereby enabling the facet of toxic masculinity that says the man always has to be on top, or he is weak and pathetic.
