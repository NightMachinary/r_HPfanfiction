As mentioned in another comment, if a guy is chased by a woman who is a bit pushy and initiates things, the common reaction (at least amongst guys) would be along the lines of "look at that lucky bastard". Even if the woman is dominant outside the bedroom, in most cases you'd only get a bit of ribbing about who wears the pants in the relationship or about being whipped.

The wimp bit only applies if the guy let's himself be changed as a person by said woman.
