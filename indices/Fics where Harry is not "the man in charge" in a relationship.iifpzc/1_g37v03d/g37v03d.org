It always confuses me when in fanfiction, Harry is the confident and dominant person in the relationship. The boy was mentally, emotionally and (possibly) physically abused his whole childhood, told repeatedly that he was worthless and that nobody would love him, and had someone try to kill him once a year every year while at Hogwarts.

Where the fuck did all this confidence come from? Realistically, Harry would be so clueless about anything even close to love and affection, that those who didn't understand his childhood would probably assume he was emotionally cold or just purposefully ignoring what they believe to be obvious signals.
