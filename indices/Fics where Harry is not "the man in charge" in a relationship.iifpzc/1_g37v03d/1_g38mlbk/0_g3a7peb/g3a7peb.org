I never said that Harry would be submissive, merely that he would have trouble with showing affection and expressing himself romantically. He does show affection in his own way, but I've read many fics (yes, not a great argument, but stick with me for a second) where people outside of his friend group believe Harry to be distant, cold and not very outgoing towards his other housemates and classmates.

eternal_boredoom below stated that they believed that Harry would be very cautious to love and relationships, due to a fear of rejection and abandonment. That is probably very possible.

However, I don't believe that Harry would be the domineering sort in the relationship, at least not at first. My annoyance comes from the fact that in the fanfictions where Harry is the dominant partner in the relationship, he's usually depicted as the dom from the very beginning. In my mind, he would be a cautious and nervous partner at the beginning, but slowly grow into a dominant partner if that is what their core personality is like.

Imagine the cautiousness to be like a series of walls around the very center of his personalities. He has to work his way through those walls before he can be his true self with someone he trusts, like a romantic partner. Having Harry be a dominant, confident partner from the very beginning is absurd and honestly is pretty much the author hand-waving the psychological effects of being mistreated as a child whenever it suits them.

Please feel free to bring up any points you think are prudent. I'm actually enjoying this discussion.
