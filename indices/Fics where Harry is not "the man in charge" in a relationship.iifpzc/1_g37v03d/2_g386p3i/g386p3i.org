While I agree I think that can be different from his sexual motivations and displays of affection.

I'd think he would be more cautious showing affection since he'd always have the fear of people leaving though.

But sexually I think he'd be more sure and dominant since it's something you have a layout to follow, even when you are inexperienced. I do think it would be the only moment where he could be domineering without guilt, sure and steady BC he could act out and ignore all those inner forcer for a bit.

It's just my op though.
