"Jakob," his mother looked down her nose disdainfully at the boy who stood beside him in Madame Malkin's. "What are you doing associating with this mudblood filth?"

"How dare you speak to me like that, Juden! I belong to the master race!" The young boy retorted.

Jakob rolled his eyes and considered introducing the pathetic little worm, who'd said his name was something Schicklgruber, but he knew his mother wouldn't care. And frankly, Jakob had grown weary of the misguided boy's diatribe.

"Perhaps we should go to Twilfitt and Tattings, mother," Jakob put his hand in hers. "It seems that Madame Malkin's has relaxed their standards, and now mudblood filth like this one are allowed to openly disparage Noble Purebloods like us."

Jakob's mother nodded her assent and as they left Madame Malkin's, Jakob shot one last glance at the fuming, dark-haired boy. He'd been polite enough at the beginning, but the longer he had opened his mouth the more Jakob had disliked him.

Is it all started shortly after Jacob told the boy his name and the boy had shown instant disdain for his Jewish heritage. He tried to explain how none of that mattered in The Wizarding World and that the Rothsteins were a prominent pure-blooded family, but the irate boy would have none of it.

As Jakob and his mother made their way way down the alley to Twilfitt and Tattings, Jakob smiled to himself. He looked forward to seeing the boy at Hogwarts, bent over crying in the hallways, the victim of some hex or another from the Slytherins and the other pure-bloods in the school who would be more than eager to show the young mudblood his place.
