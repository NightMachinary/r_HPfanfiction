I'm going to assume you're asking this in good faith.

in canon and in a lot of fanon, purebloods are the ones with all the money. purebloods run Hogwarts. if you suddenly make them jewish, it mirrors the existing real-world narrative that some people have that "Jews control the world/banks/society/whatever".

I can see the appeal of trying to reverse roles for the sake of a story, but not when it reinforces harmful stereotypes.
