Canonically JKR said that students have the same religions as the muggles, it just isn't featured with as much importance. So it's really not much of a stretch to think some Pureblood are Jewish, some Catholic, some Atheists, some neo-pagans... really, having a pureblood Jew isn't really going along with conspiracy theory's or being offensive, statistically if we consider the fact that those who descend from muggleborn Jews may eventually become purebloods then it makes sense that at least some would keep to their grand-grandparents religion, to say nothing of the possibility of a member of the family finding out about the religion, identifying with it, deciding to convert and bringing family members along (maybe only the generations post-convention became pureblood supremacists).

Of course, this is said with the knowledge I have of the matter, if anyone reading it works with statistics or is Jew and find anything I said wrong then please, feel free to correct me.
