To be fair though in no moment the OP said or even implied that Jews would be particularly inclined to blood-supremacy, the post talked about a particular pureblood-supremacist that so happens to be Jew meeting a muggleborn that just happens to be Nazi. Even the arguments about stereotypes don't really last, seeing as the closer OP came of implying that this Jew family in particular was rich was the mention of that other clothing store, which doesn't really counts seeing that even someone of mid-class could reasonably buy in a higher-end store, though probably not as frequently as someone of upper-class would (even more so as in most cases there wouldn't be a difference as big in price for an uniform), in no moment was there any other mention that even came close to implying that this was a “Malfoy Familly 2.0: The reboot”. Arguing that they must have been from upper-class because they were pureblood-supremacists would be similar as saying that only rich people are racists. Being (or not) a bigoted asshole is not something exclusive to any financial-class in particular.
