blood supremacy is literally in the title, though?

I'm not trying to say people can't write stuff. I'm not the purity police. what I am trying to say, possibly poorly, is words have power, and if you want to write about something that might reinforce negative stereotypes about a group of people, be aware of that. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
