...Except you're the one bringing up this stereotype in the first place? Also the Gaunts and the Weasleys are not rich from what I remember? I'm not going to do a role reversal if I write the story: the Nazi and the Pureblood will both be horrible peoples and will do everything to bring the other down.

If you're triggered by this stereotype does that mean the existence of the Rothschilds trigger you? Because as much you seems to deny this they are Jews. I'm not racist/antisemite or whatever but I begin to get extremely tired of PC.
