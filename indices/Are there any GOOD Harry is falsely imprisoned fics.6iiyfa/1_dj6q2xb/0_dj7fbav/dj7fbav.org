This entire comment is a spoiler so don't read if you haven't already read the story.

[[/spoiler][I hated in so much when his wife died though, it didn't seem to add anything but pain to the story, and I feel like the end would have been far more emotionally rewarding has she not. I really don't see why he did it and it rankles a little as there seemed to be no explanation or reason for it from a narrative perspective. She just died pointlessly and it sucked a whole lot. It actually still hurts a little to think about, the story drew me in emotionally and just left that grief there without dealing with it either.]]
