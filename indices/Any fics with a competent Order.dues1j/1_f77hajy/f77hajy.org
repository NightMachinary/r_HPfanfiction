Linkffn(The Serpent and the Phoenix) has a competent but underdog Order fighting an actual war against Voldemort for most of Harry's sixth year (year five is AU and doesn't match OoTP, but is just mentioned in passing, story starts in year 6). Some cool battle and strategy scenes and interesting fleshing out of Order members who are only mentioned by name in canon.
