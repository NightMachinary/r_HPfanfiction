Have you tried Alexandra Quick? A very different world from canon, more classical writing than nonjon but still good. A completely-OC story in an original American wizarding setting. linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle)

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) is a complete AU inspired by Alanna the Lioness, less tight but very engaging.

There are also some big classics like linkffn(Forging the Sword), linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived), linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). The first two are incomplete, the third in progress. Anything by enembee or joe6991 is also a classic AU tale, and most of their fics are complete.
