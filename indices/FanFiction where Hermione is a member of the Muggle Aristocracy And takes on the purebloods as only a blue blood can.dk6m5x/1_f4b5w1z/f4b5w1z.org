Closest I know of is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9552519/1/][Reboot]], Where Hermione is actually Hermione Graynge, a member of some noble muggle house, she hides it at Dumbledore's suggestion the first time through, this being a timetravel story, she doesn't hide it the second time. However this plot thread doesn't really go anywhere unfortunately.

Now for two that only are related to your request because they have Hermione as royalty in them.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13228631/1/][A Whole New World]] Hadn't gone far, Hermione is a princess for some mystical kingdom.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13130897/1/][Incomplete]] an okay angsty H/Hr fic, Hermione is actually royalty for some foreign country.
