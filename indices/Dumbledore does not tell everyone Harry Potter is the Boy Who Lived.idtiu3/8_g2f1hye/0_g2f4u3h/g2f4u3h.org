I'm not saying that he should tell everyone the truth about what happened. My idea would have been telling everyone that James and Lily with the help of Dumbledore created a trap for Voldemort in case he should ever attack the Potter Cottage. Lily and James gave their lives in the fight against Voldemort to ensure that the trap works, and Voldemort is defeated. To protect Harry (not necessarily in an evil Dumbledore way) Dumbledore claims most of the credit for the vanquishing to prevent Death Eater from searching revenge on Harry.
