Well, there'd need to be some explanation for the scar, but that's not so hard to manage.

I'm surprised Dumbledore didn't try to put all the credit on Lily. Publicly, I mean, not just to Harry. Not only does it shields Harry from scrutiny and celebrity, but its a nice bit of counter-propaganda to Pure Blood prejudice (a "lowly Muggleborn" defeated Voldemort).

The only reason I can think is he didn't want the actual nature of Harry's protection to become common knowledge, and crediting Lily might have helped people guess the truth, so he used "The Boy Who Lived" as a cover story. Or (for a more ruthless Dumbledore) he wanted to ensure that Voldemort would focus on Harry to fulfill the prophecy.
