We don't really know how people know Harry survived. It's not in the books and JK never mentioned it as far as I know. If I were to guess Lily and James neighbors spread the news. Once the Fidelius was down anyone could see what Voldemort did to the house and the fact that he didn't come out. They may have even saw Hagrid or Sirius leave with baby Harry, and spread the story from there.
