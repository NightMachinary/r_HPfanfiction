If the secret is worded as "The Potter family lives in Godric Hollows", as soon as Lily and James are dead the secret is no longer true (Harry alone being alive does not count as "the Potter family", he's just one person). If the secret is no longer true then the Fidelius Charm collapses. This is just my headcanon, but it explains why Snape and Hagrid, who presumably haven't been told the secret, can see and enter the house (Sirius wasn't the secret keeper but he was probably told the secret). If I'm not mistaken in the books when the secret keeper dies every person who knows the secret becomes the secret keeper, so Pettegrew dying wouldn't break the charm. In the sixth book, with Dumbledore's death (the secret keeper) the Fidelius doesn't collapse probably because the secret (the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix is in Grimmauld Place) is still believed to be true by some of the secret keepers. What I mean is that the adults in the order probably meet in some other place (so new headquarters) but for Harry/Ron/Hermione Grimmauld place is still considered Headquarters, at least until it becomes even more compromised and they abandon it.
