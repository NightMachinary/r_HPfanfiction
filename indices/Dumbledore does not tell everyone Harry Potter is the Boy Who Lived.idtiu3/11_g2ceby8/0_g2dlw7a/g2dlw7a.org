But the Fidelius wasn't down, Voldemort simply knew the secret.

Which opens up another problem. Why was anyone who did not know the secret from Pettigrew able to find the Cottage? I mean we know that only the Secret Keeper can tell the secret to others and that the Death of the Caster (either Lily of James) does not completely end the Fidelius. The only thing that should somehow end it would be the Death of the Secret Keeper who did not die.
