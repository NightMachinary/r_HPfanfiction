i meant that they wouldn't believe the rumors so they'd have found some way to confirm it with their magic. which is why they know the specific details. they probably didn't know about james and lily fighting for the order. people did know about the fidileus and people where prejudiced enough against sirius to not treat him fairly. so they must have had more facts than the context to put them in. so they probably had some magical means to find out what happened.
