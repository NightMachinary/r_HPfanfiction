Forget-Me-Not by Lomonaaeren was honestly the first I thought of (I just started getting back into the HP fandom) but my gosh it is so great. Lomonaaeren is an amazing writer and I have followed their work for at least a decade.

Further details I had forgotten (pun unintended): Dumbledore casts a protection spell on number 4 so strong that HP is utterly forgotten.

Updated to add that the forgetting of HP continued in Hogwarts.
