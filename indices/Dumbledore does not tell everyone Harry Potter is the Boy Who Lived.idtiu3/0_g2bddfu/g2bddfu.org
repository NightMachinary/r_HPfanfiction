I wondered this same thing yesterday. How did the legend of the Boy Who Lived come to be? Let's think about what happened. (I don't have the book at hand right now, correct me if I'm mistaken.)

1. Voldemort attacks the Potters in Godric's Hollow and disappears.
2. Dumbledore learns of what has happened without visiting the house and sends Hagrid to fetch Harry.
3. Hagrid fetches Harry, meets Sirius, takes his flying motorcycle, and begins to fly to Little Whinging.
4. Vernon Dursley overhears several wizards talking about Harry defeating Voldemort.
5. Dumbledore and McGonagall meet in Little Whinging, then Hagrid arrives, and Harry is left with the Dursleys. Only four people at this point have seen Harry's scar or even know for sure that he has survived.
6. Without Harry ever showing his face in the wizarding world, everyone knows he has a lightning-shaped scar because he survived Voldemort's attack.

So, how did all the wizards learn about this? The only explanation I can think of is that Hagrid stopped in every wizarding pub on the way from Godric's Hollow to Little Whinging, and showed the baby Harry to everyone. That would also explain why it took so long for Hagrid to fly such quite a short distance. (It's just over 100 miles from West Country to Surrey.)

Harry never wanted attention. His legend caused much misery to him and to those close to him. Sadly, he never learned that he had to go through it because of his good friend, Rubeus Hagrid.
