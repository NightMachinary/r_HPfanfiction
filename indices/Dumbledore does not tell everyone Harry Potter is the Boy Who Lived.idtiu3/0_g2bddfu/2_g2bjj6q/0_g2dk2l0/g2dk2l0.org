I'm definitely laying the blame on Hagrid. Eleven year olds got him to spill secrets about a very precious artifact he was helping the headmaster guard. He /also/ gave away secrets about it to a mysterious rando in a bar because he was distracted by the illegal dragon egg. Rubeus Hagrid is not good at keeping secrets.
