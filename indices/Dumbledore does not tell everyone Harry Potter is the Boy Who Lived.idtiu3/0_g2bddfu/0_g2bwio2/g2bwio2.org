We have to be cautious about the timeline, so here's what we know:

1. Voldemort kills the Potter late on Oct 31st.
2. Vernon goes to work, so it has to be a work day --> Monday Nov 2nd
3. Harry gets dropped off that very evening --> it's been approximately 48 hours since his parents died

I know most of this is probably irrelevant because JKR never consulted a calendar but still. I don't believe Dumbledore would get a child out of a collapsed house after an attempt on their life and never get them checked out. Also what did Hagrid do during the daytime? Keep flying Harry from wherever Godric's Hollow is to Surrey? That wouldn't take 24 hours.
