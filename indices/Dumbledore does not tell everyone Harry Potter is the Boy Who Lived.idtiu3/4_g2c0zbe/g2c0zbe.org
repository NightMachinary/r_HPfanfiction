I imagine there are spells that can be used to recreate a crime scene/what happened akin to what Newt did in FB2. It's quite possible that Aurors watched Voldemort try to kill Harry and then the recollection gets foggy due to the powerful nature of the Magic. So everyone just assumed that Harry had something to do with it as well.
