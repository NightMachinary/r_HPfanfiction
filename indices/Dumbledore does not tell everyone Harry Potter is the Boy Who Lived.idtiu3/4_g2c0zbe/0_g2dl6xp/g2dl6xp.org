If such magic exists (I did not watch FB2) it would create a lot of plot holes in the story.

Here are two examples from the top of my mind:

The whole chamber of Secrets Plot could be avoided by simply recreating a crime scene where someone got petrified.

You could find out who put Harrys name in the Goblet of Fire

To be honest nearly every advanced form of Magic creates some form of Plot Hole in the story so this might still be the case
