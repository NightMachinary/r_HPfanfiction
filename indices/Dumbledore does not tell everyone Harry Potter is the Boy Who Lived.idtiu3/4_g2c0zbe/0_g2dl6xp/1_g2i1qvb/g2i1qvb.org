  The whole chamber of Secrets Plot could be avoided by simply recreating a crime scene where someone got petrified.

  You could find out who put Harrys name in the Goblet of Fire

Well, I'm assuming you need trace evidence to recreate it. It's likely that the Basilisk just straight up killed Myrtle without leaving a mark along with Riddle covering up his tracks to begin with.

As for who put his name in the goblet of fire, the same thing probably applies. It's far too subtle and it's probably not a spell anyone other than an Auror or probably Dumbledore /would/ know (aside from Newt Scamander who demonstrated the spell as well).
