Harry/Lisa Turpin. I liked Call Me to the point where I decided to write my own fic with that pairing (albeit with a somewhat different characterisation)

Harry/Katie Bell: If you, like me, like the pairing but found "West of Here" too AU, there is a Western-free alternative.

Now for the really rare, there is exactly one good Harry/Cho fic.
