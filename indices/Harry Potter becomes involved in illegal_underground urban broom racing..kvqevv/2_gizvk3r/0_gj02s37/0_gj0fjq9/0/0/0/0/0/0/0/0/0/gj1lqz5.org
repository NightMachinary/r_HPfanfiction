I meant to say Dom, it was a gag in Furious 7 that Mr. Nobody kept trying to get Dom to drink this Belgian Ale. Basically the rule is it has to be a mainstream beer while a side character tries to get them to drink something nicer. You're right about the cider thing, it just doesn't fit the narrative with the Fast and the Furious references.
