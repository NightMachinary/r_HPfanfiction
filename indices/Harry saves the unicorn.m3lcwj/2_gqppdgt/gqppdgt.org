I know I've read several fics where it happens, but it's usually such a minor thing that I can't remember most of them. But there are a few I know about.

In linkffn(Knowing The Future by Danny-Shells) the unicorn is saved and it's even slightly relevant to the plot.

Animagus Mishap! by dragen/The Dark Dragen takes place in fourth year, so the scene with the unicorn happens as in canon, but it is later revealed that the unicorn survived, and she asks Harry for help. The story is also dead, I don't think it was great to begin with, and I'm not linking it due to rule 8.
