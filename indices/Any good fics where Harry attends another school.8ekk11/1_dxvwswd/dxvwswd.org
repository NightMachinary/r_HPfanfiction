I haven't got any for those schools, but have you read these linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi; The Magnate by Halt.CPM). Both are centred around Drumstrang and The Magnate has a few early similarities to HPatBWL due to the fact that it's one of the best fics in the fandom (imo), but quickly comes into its own. Unfortunately it looks like both are abandoned but still worth it anyway.
