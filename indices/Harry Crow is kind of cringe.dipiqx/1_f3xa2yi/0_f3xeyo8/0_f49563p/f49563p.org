It was popular at a time when tropes were new and HP fanfic was looking for /any/ long self-consistant fics of reasonable quality, people lapped it up at the time because its all there was.

These days it wouldn't have been nearly as popular. Its dry, repetitive, overly long, cringy and has a whole host of other problems which become apparent once you are no longer starved for good fanfics.

I unfortunately found it a bit late into my initial foray into HP fanfic, and /really/ couldnt get into it no matter how much I tried at the time.

Its just boring.
