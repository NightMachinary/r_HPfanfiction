I have kind of similar experience with “Different Halloween”. I actually really like the setup. Yes, it is sickly sweet and fluffy, but it was kind like having sweet pastry --- once in a while, it is good to eat it. However, he fixed all problems too soon (NO SPOILERS!), so suddenly he had no plot to follow, no dramatic conflict to resolve. I think it would be possible to finish whole story somewhere after the scene when Voldemort missed the fine print, and it would be just setup, but it would make some sense. Except he didn't and tried to continue with no plot whatsoever and the rest of the story is really bad. It's a pity.
