I liked the premise of Harry Crow, but not the execution. It was a variant on the Super!Harry type of fic and I really hated that he was all powerful and got everything he wanted. There was never any real conflict that Harry Crow couldn't overcome. The only major 'cringe' for me was the presentation on the steps of Gringotts and the singing of "Blowin' in the Wind". Yeek.
