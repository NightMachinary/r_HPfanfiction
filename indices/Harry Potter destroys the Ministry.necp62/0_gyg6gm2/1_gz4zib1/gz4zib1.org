Fair warning: There's a touch of weeaboo in this fic.

For those who are interested about the Ministry's Destruction as per OP's request, Chapter 34 is when Harry basically brings armageddon. 35 to 36 tells what happened to the survivors afterwards. 37 is a timeskip and is where I dropped it due to the magic samurai thing.
