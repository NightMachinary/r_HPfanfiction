Yeah, I tried to read it but it's so boring. Maybe it's good for someone just getting into fanfics but, honestly speaking, there are many stories that are written better than this. After reading them, I can't read fics like this one.

Maybe I should become a writer and try my hand at this, make it how I want it to be.
