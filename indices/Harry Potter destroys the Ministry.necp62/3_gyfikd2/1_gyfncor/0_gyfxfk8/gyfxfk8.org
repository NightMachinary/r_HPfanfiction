It says no prior knowledge is needed but there are paragraphs and paragraphs and huge chunks of chapters that are just the author giving you the warcraft story. I like the idea but the most recent chapter I just scrolled through until I got to relevant action.

I wanted to read a story about the dragon friends in HP world. Not a story about HP in Warcraft world.
