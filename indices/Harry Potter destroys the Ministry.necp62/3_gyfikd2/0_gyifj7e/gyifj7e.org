This is currently my favorite HP crossover. It's really great, Even a person like myself with limited knowledge on WoW understands this fic easily. I love the progression harry an co is going through power wise, instead of not gaining power or it being instant, it's a good pace. My only problem personally not with the story is that I'm too impatient lol. The build up for taking down the ministry is still on going at a decent pace and the future setups but uggghhhhhh I just want harry to curb stomp the ministry with badass magic and dragons ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
