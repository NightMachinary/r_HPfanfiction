Harry is a Dragon and that's OK has quite the hilarious Dumbledore.

I.e. after a trip to ministry with Harry he offers to take him to a restaurant of 'famous Scottish chef'... and they end up in McDonald's.

In general a great story, with explicit premise of Harry being a Dragon and a hidden premise of 'what if everyone behaved like a reasonable human being' Quite treat, and it updates few times a week with chapters of ~1k words.
