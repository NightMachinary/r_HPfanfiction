My favorite from canon is the movie portrayal of the "Alax, earwax," moment.

One of my favorite fanon moments is this quote, although I gave up on the fic after the third time H was raped (and will therefore not be identifying or linking it):

  “As with recent years, the Dark Forest is to be considered out-of-bounds. I understand there has been some confusion as to what this might mean. By the ‘Dark Forest', I mean the place nearest to our game-keeper's home where the trees are thickest. By ‘out-of-bounds' I mean that you are politely requested to refrain. I don't see how I can make this more plain, but if you need further clarification, please see me tomorrow, and I will try,” he added, smiling in Harry's direction.
