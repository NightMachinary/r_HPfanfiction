Favourite fanfiction Dumbledore is the one from "Itachi, is that a baby?" Hands down. some choice quotes.

"In addition to the forbidden objects, the Forbidden Forest is, shockingly enough, forbidden. This, too, is not a negotiable point. Any student stupid enough to go into the Forest will not be punished, we simply won't go look for you. Considering the nature of the dwellers in the Forest, I will remind the students that they should avoid it unless they are facing their Potions final."

"I have one further announcement to make. This year, the rooms on the east side of the third floor are forbidden to anyone who does not wish to die a truly remarkable death. I realize that in a school of young people, some of you are certain to go exploring because of this warning, but by giving it, I am now covered as far as the board of directors is concerned. I reiterate that the rooms on the east side of the third floor are forbidden and that any student who dies as a result of ignoring this warning will be buried in the usual mass grave in back of the castle reserved for those who have thankfully removed themselves from our society before their idiocy can do too much damage. Thank you. Now, time for bed. Sleep well." Dumbledore bowed and turned, walking out the staff entrance to the hall."

Dumbledore flung a burning hex into the bacon on the head table, causing food to launch into the air and rain festive bits of scorched pork-product on everyone.

"So, it is time to end a year of studying and learning new things. I realize most of you did so with members of the opposite gender instead." He gave a half-glare around the hall. "I have no doubt that most of you are eager to leave this institution of intellectual pursuits so that you may sooner empty your heads of all thought and focus on things more important to the short-sighted minds of the very young and innocently stupid."

"The House Elves have packed your things and loaded them onto the Express. As such, you are all free to go. A word of warning: after several incidents in which students were left behind by the train, we are instituting a new policy. Namely: alerting you to the fact that the train leaves promptly in one hour, at which time it will be your problem to return home." Several students rose and were nearly at the door when Dumbledore spoke again. "I probably should award the House Cup, but if you people missed the red and gold papering the walls, then I see no reason to bother your overtaxed brains now. But with that in mind, I need to make a few announcements. Please return to your seats. Thank you."
