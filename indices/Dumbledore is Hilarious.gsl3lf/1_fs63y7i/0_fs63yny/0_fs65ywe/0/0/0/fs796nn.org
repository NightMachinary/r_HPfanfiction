I like the concept too, just feel that this fic aims for "charming" but lands more at "alienating".

I would like someone to create a fic where Harry (or an original character) really gets immersed in magical experimentation and discovery, without coming off as an unlikeable, outlandish psychopath who does not or cannot form friendships...
