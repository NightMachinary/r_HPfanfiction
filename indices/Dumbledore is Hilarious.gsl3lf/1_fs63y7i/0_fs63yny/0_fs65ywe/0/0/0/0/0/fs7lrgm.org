Eish, I think I started that once, and just found Harry insufferable. If it's the fic I'm thinking of, that is.

I'd like a character who's inquisitive and eager without being inexplicably better educated than every adult around them, and still actually fascinated and engaged with the magical world.

Because, let's face it, most of us at the age of 11 if introduced to the world of magic would be desperate to learn and understand more about it, but we wouldn't have godlike levels of experimental or theoretical understanding of science.
