One of the best one off gags, really just a side note about Dumbledore is from Harry Potter, Geek of Magic linkffn(12703694)

One chapter is a series of letter from Hermione to her parents:

/Dear Mum and Dad,/

/.../

/I told you that our Potions Professor is a little scary and Neville is a nervous wreck around him. I'm trying to help him prepare for the class, but it's not going very well. Harry has decided that we should get him used to Professor Snape, so, to help Neville, he's made a Professor Snape mask. It's very lifelike, and Ronald is a good mimic. I'm a little afraid of how Professor Snape will respond when he finds out about it./

/Love, Hermione/

/#/

/Dear Mum and Dad,/

/Professor Snape has found out about the Professor Snape mask. He told Harry to hand it in, so Harry wore it to class. Professor Snape usually arrives just when class is about to start, and when he got there, Harry was standing at the front, lecturing about how potions is the best subject. Harry got five detentions./

/A lot of people asked him about it, so Harry's made more masks and he's started selling them. I told him not to. The Headmaster bought one./

/Professor Snape ignores Neville now. He's too busy with Harry...../
