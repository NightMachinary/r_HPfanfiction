Less 'slightly insane' and more 'completely off his rocker' Dumbledore is in Core Threads, in that story one of the things he did was wear a pumpkin costume for Hallowern, and the explanation for why Dumbledore had the Invisibility Cloak was that he kept 'borrowing' it to sneak past Mcgonagall and eat his candy(I think that's he did with it), and James got so frustrated he just threw the cloak at him.

A slightly more sane Dumbledore isnin Itachi, is that a baby?, he was crazy and does crazy things, and he gets away with it because it's a crack fic(sorta), some of my favorite parts was him being serious and snarky while everyone else is crazy, that and the food fights where he animates his chicken to defend him.\\
Edit: actually he is less crazy and more of a troll that is waiting for everyone to call him on his bullshit and is disappointed no one did that yet.
