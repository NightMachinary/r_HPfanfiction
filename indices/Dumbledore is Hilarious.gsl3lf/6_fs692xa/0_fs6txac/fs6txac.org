There was a fic in which Harry says "I did not know you were into Muggle baiting, Headmaster" in this scene once the cups started bouncing against the Dursley's heads. Ever since then I could not see this scene as anything but bullying by the Dumbledore. Even though Dursley's deserve way worse for how they treated Harry, Dumbledore's actions right then was not going to make things better for anybody involved. And only makes it seem to be unnecessary bullying. In a way, Dumbledore was proving to the Dursley's that they were right to be wary of any wizard if his own actions can be this petty.
