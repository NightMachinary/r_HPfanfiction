I would and I see no shame in it, malfoy is a racist and a bully. But I'm just tired of either putting Dumbledore in a pedestal as if he could do no wrong or making him the most evil person who ever eviled. Dumbledore is a flawed man and at the end of the day he is not perfect, I just wish he was given the same courtesy of being human as people like Draco and Snape get from the fandom. People will roll over backwards to explain their actions and make them seem noble but ron and Dumbledore don't have leeway. I guess one mistake from their part is all that can be tolerated.
