Fair enough but what about when Draco is turned into a ferret (now you could make an argument that Malfoy is magical but he is still a child being tormented by an adult) or when fred and george are feefing their experimental sweets to the first year. Now you could make an argument that they are still kids and the firsties gave consent (they are young and don't know better, so Fred and George should be more responsible ) but then how would you characterise adults I don't remember of the top of my head but fred and george where very close to their majority (it might have been their OWL years). I could forgive Harry's past actions (in the fanfic) if before trying to lecture Dumbledore he could and should have a had moment of introspection that when he had laughed on those occasion he was wrong rather than immediately be a sanctimonious prick.
