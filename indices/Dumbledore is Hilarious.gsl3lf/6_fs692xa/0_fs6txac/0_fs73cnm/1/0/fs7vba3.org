I know it happens in that particular fanfic and that's what I'm commenting on . If i remember correctly harry wants to distance himself from Dumbledore and the author decided to use that scene to give us an ugly portrayal of him (how Dumbledore despite being an advocate for muggleborns/muggle was harassing a family of muggles). Now I don't mind harry breaking off from Dumbledore's shadow nor do I have a problem with Dumbledore being manipulative but doing it in a way without commenting on Harry's past action makes him look like a hypocrite and hence my comment. If you want to show an established character in negative light try not to take cheap shots. In that fic Harry smugly says that Dumbledore was muggle baiting despite the fact that he was fine with similar action before (until that point in the fic the actions I've said before were of canon harry).

Look inside before you look outside, people rarely see their fault in real life and that's fine too, but if you want show that your Harry is right and has a moral high ground than i can't let his dismissal of his own action pass.
