In that fic, in that particular scene, Harry was concerned about getting Dumbledore to leave. He was not that concerned about the Dursleys, but was using that to get to Dumbledore. Atleast that was the impression I got. He was less being an hypocrite and more being manipulative. That's what I thought atleast. I would have to reread the fic to be sure.

Also, the tail happened 5 years ago and the toffee 2 years ago. People change. Besides, do you really expect fanfic authors to address the minor details that happened couple of books ago. I had to reread to remember exactly how that scene panned out.

And if you think Harry is wrong to expect better of Dumbledore than of himself, I will say only one thing. Dumbledore is about 100 years older than Harry.
