About that fanfic author bit I know from personal experience that addressing the outcome of the change you as a writer make can be daunting and I don't have a clue on how to do it correctly but I try to do so even when I fail at adressing everything but it still isn't an excuse. Correct research and atleast trying to address everything whether explicitly or implicitly (atleast when it comes to results of your own change to canon) is what makes a good fic great and why some fanfic writers are held in greater esteem than others.

It might be that harry was trying to be manipulative and not at all concerned about the dursleys i dont remember quite well but the first reply made it sound that what Dumbledore was doing was such a huge issue, so that's why I commented.

And about Dumbledore being 100 yrs older than harry and being more responsible sadly it does matter in real world I guess but really it shouldn't. If age being an argument was valid than there would be no reason to not listen to your elders but old people do make mistakes and their actions because they carry so much weight make those mistakes look far worse than they really are. The scene in canon was set up to be comedic in contrast to the dark times ahead but because it's dumbledore (who we perceive as someone who failed Harry and should have done more) sound far worse. You commented how you can never read the same scene again in a positive light then you should also be unable to read every other scene with fred and george or hagrid again in a positive light. Imagine subjecting Dudley who wasn't correctly taught right from wrong and was a kid to have a pig's tail and having to go to surgery for it or nearly choking to death with his own tongue. How horrifying it would be to not able to breathe. Fred and george or hagrid didn't target the adults ie vernon or petunia but a kid but we still laugh at that incident.
