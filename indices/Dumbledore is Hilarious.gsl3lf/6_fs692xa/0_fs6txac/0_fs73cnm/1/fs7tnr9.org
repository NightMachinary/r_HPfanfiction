You do realise that this happens in a fanfiction, right? In canon, Harry was not particularly concerned for the Dursley's in that scene. And of course, he might enjoy seeing his tormentors being bullied for once. He is a teenager. I am an adult and even I think I would not be that forgiving. It doesn't make him an hypocrite at least not for this.
