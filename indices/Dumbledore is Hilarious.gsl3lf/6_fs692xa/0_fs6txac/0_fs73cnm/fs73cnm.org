I remember reading that Muggle baiting bit and found Harry being a hipocrite because when Fred and George gave Dudley that tongue toffee in canon he found it hilarious or when Hagrid gave him a tail. It's as if the headmaster is the only one who could do wrong and not our beloved saintly characters like Fred and George or Hagrid even though Dumbledore's act was the only one which was harmless. Harry is not a saint as portrayed in the movies he is imperfect and finds pleasure in Dudley's suffering (when its not life threatening) but whatever evil Dumbledore is evil.
