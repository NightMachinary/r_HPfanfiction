  It's the sequel to "Broken Chains and a SG crossover. It could be that author's best work ever, as long as he doesn't mess up the remaining third of the story.

Can you sell me on The Stars Alone without spoiling it? I've read Broken Chains and liked it well enough, but the new story just sounds way too over the top and leaving pretty much the Harry Potter universe behind. Is it basically just a SG1 fic (I liked SG1... not sure about reading a whole fanfic about it though)?
