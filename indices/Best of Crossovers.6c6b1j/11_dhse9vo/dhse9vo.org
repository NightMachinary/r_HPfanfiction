linkffn(Broken Chains by Darth Marrs): My favorite SW crossover, I like it way better than his latest "Katarn Side".

linkffn(The Stars Alone by Darth Marrs): It's the sequel to "Broken Chains and a SG crossover. It could be that author's best work ever, as long as he doesn't mess up the remaining third of the story.
