One of the best Harry Potter crossovers is linkffn(3473224), The Denarian Renegade. Shezza did a great job with this; Dresden Files/Harry Potter crossover.

Another good one, though more of a comedy, is linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5030443/chapters/11562568]]). It's the only good Harry Potter crossover with a manga I've come across.
