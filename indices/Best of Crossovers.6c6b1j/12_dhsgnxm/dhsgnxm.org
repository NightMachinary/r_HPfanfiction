linkfffn(5353683) and it's sequel are two of my faves. They're HP/Sailor Moon/ Ranma 1/2 crossovers and they're essentially crack. It with enough plot and seriousness to not quite be crack. Also has the best outlandishly evil Snape I've ever seen as well as senile as fuck Dumbledore. Voldemort's fate is also A+.
