I actually tried to read this fic because I really like Buffy... It's so terrible! Just a few chaptes in Xander becomes an expert in wandless magic, is the king of the goblins because he defeated their leader or something and teaches everyone how to fly without a broom.

What even is the point of any of this? I have read crack!fics that were less of a joke. Dumbledore researching the perfect lemon drop as a secret weapon against a diabetic Voldemort ist more reasonable than anything that happens in the first few chapters of this story.
