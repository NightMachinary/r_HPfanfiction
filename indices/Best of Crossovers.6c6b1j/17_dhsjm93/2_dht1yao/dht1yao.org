Buffy crossover with... Xander? Why?! I like the dude as much as the next guy, but he's probably the most vanilla of all the characters from Buffy. Is it interesting?

Edit: Whoa, I just noticed how Xander is basically the same archetype character (kinda average, funny, ...) as Ron, except better in every regard.
