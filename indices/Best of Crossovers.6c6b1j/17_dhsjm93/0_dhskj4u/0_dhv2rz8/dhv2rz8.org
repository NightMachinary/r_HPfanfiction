Well, I'm not sure about that one since I've not read it as of yet, but “Harry Potter: Geth”, which is one of the author's other stories, has Harry being fairly powerful and game-changing to the point where it would by itself become boring, but also has him be the butt of many a situation and he occasionally grumbles that they can take the power he has because he doesn't want it and it is kind of hilarious.

That said, I have no idea how well that translates into enjoyability of other works of theirs, as “Harry Potter: Geth” is tagged as “humor” and this one isn't.
