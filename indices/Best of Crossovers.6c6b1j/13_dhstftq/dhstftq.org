Child Of The Storm is my favorite crossover, personally.

It's an HP/Avengers crossover, and X-Men stuff makes an appearance later, not sure if they're actually part of the Avengers and I'm not aware or if it's a triple cross. It's finished, but the sequel is still going. The sequel, linkffn(Ghosts Of The Past, by Nimbus Llewelyn) is also good. As fair warning, it's /monstrously/ long.

I will admit that I rarely see it mentioned in these crossover posts, though I'm not honestly sure why. Nobody ever says that it's bad, but I've also not gotten good comments either? 0 idea.
