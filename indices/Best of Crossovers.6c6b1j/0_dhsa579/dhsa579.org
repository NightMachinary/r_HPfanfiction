linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger): When Harry is King's Cross Station after being hit with the Killing Curse by Voldemort, he is called to Middle Earth by the Witch-King of Angmar a thousand years before the events seen in The Lord of the Rings. At the time of this comment, has the most favorites and follows of *any* LotR crossover. WiP.

linkffn(Cursebreaking Hamunaptra by Zenzao): A fusion of Harry Potter with The Mummy (1999 remake). Features Bill Weasley as the main character. Beautifully written with great worldbuilding hidden throughout, and outstanding magic. WiP with very infrequent updates.
