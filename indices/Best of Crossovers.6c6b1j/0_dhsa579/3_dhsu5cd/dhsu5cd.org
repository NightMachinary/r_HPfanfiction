  She walked into his office with a map and a plea for help, out of options to turn to and desperately short on knowledge. How could he say no? A Bill Weasley versus the Mummy challenge fic in progress. AU - canon divergence and fusion, some humor. Rating may change with future updates.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
