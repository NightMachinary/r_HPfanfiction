linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon) is an excellent Firefly crossover. Harry Potter wakes up after sleeping for hundreds of years to find that humans have left Earth and magic has apparently disappeared. He eventually joins up with the crew of Serenity to figure out what happened.

I really enjoyed this fic, and it has plenty of nonjon's trademark humor that fits right in with the characters from Firefly. Harry and River especially have some great interactions. It's not a perfect fic and has some pacing issues, but still definitely worth the read.
