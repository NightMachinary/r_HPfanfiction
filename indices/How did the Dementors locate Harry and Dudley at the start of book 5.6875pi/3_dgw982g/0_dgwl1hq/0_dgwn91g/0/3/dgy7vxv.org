I thought we didn't have anything in canon to state that it was a 50/50 split each time? Split doesn't necessarily have to mean half, it can also mean along a grain/fissure. Murder causes damage to the soul, so it could use that damage/weak point to cause a breakage. It would explain why the Locket, for example, was plenty powerful, while the Cup doesn't seem to have been as powerful, both having been created in the same time period (They appear to be in good spirits, not looking any worse for wear, and the phrase "it was nothing" was used. To me that implies it wasn't nearly as difficult). It's also implied the cup was created first- Hepzibah had both the Locket and Cup, but Rowling stated that Hepzibah's murder was the one used to turn the cup into a Horcrux, and a muggle tramp for the locket. So by the 50/50 reasoning, the cup should have stronger/more powerful protections than the locket.

(I'm with you, I don't like the 50/50 hypothesis)
