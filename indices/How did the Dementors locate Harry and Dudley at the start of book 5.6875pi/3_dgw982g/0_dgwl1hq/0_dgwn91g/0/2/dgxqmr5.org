I agree with you, but we do see that Riddle's Diary is seemingly more powerful than the other Horcruxes, and it was the first to be made. The Locket was made either second or third IIRC, and that put up more of a fight than the others as well.

It could be linked to how important the object used is, or the significance of the murder, or any number of variables. Fanfiction that comes up with plausible and thought out mechanisms for this kind of thing is particularly enjoyable for me.
