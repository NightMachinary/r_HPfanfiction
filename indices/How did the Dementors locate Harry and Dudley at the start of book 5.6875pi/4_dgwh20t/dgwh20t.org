I always assumed that Dementors prefer magical targets. Therefore when they were sent on their assassination attempt they homed in on the only magical soul in the area.

But still, I mean even owls can find specific people in the magical world. Its not so out there that Dementors can know and identify Harry in some way and specifically target him. Maybe they got a personal vendetta against him for the uber-Patronus he sent against them when they finally captured Sirius.
