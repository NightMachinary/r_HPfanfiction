Dementors were all around Hogwarts after Siruis escaped and surprisingly enough, that is where he was. The Ministry of Magic didn't know where he was. Not only that, a Dementor specifically targeted Harry on the Hogwarts train and only attacked him.

Dementors seem to somehow know the general area of people and are also actual guards with shows they aren't just mindless beast. They don't go around kissing everyone and target specific people.

Actually, considering Voldemort himself or any of his lackies never tried to storm the house that may be part of the reason idk It seems odd someone Harry is a pretty famous person.
