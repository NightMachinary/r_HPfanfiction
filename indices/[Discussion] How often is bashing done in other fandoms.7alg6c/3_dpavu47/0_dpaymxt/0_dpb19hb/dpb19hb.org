The difficult question is where do you draw the line between bashing and being brutally honest about flaws?

Is every single adult in Hogwarts absolutely incompetent because they missed stuff like the Basilisk, Harry becoming an outcast (in GoF), Snape's behavior, the racially motivated terrorists within their school and so on? Is it bashing to call them out on their failures?

As for Asoiaf, most of the popular stories tend to end up on the opposite side of the spectrum as far as bashing goes. The "bad" characters, or at least Sansa and Dany often end up as Mary Sues, which is really annoying. Rhaegar Targaryen ends up being the hero in the Rebellion stories while there are very few fics where Robert is the good guy. I mean, we have thousands of "Voldemort/The Death Eaters did nothing wrong" fics so it is not too far fetched to expect a decent Robert/Lyanna, right?
