In twilight, pjato, and avengers ff bashing is a pretty common thing. It looks a bit different than hp bashing tho. In hp the biggest bashing is good old proper ron bashing, the extended form being/molly, and from there the rest of the Weasley family. This can take a few different forms, but the most common is the dumbleworship brigade, with rampant bribery and rape via love potion attempts. The-world's-most-idiotic-supergenius manipulative!dumbledore bashing is next, who is supposedly omniscient yet never fails to be surprised when Harry's inevitably discovers his machinations, the extended form being when he is literally an evil worse than voldemort (I recall a scene from a particularly out there fic I read years ago where Dumbledore has snape prepare him a magic bath that he soaks in to create a horcrux, with some very vivid imagery.) When you take hp bashing to its furthest logical conclusion, you get bashing of the entire magical society sans death eaters for betraying Harry and sentencing him unlawfully to Azkaban. WBWL!brother bashing gets an honorable mention, usually with the bashing apple not falling far from the tree.

In twilight, the bashing is usually just an extension of the bashing already in the books (read: every single human except Charlie and Bella), or a rebound effect of the total lack of bashing of any supernatural characters resulting in extreme bashing and character warping. In the first one, it's just a continuation of the script of perfection only achievable by the supernatural, that renders all humans the scum of the earth who have nothing better than to be jealous and petty. In the second one, 90% of the time it's ripping apart edward so bella can be with jasper/jacob/emmet/alice/rosalie, 9% of the time it's all of the vamps getting ripped apart so Bella can be with jacob/Paul/seth/etc. The remaining one percent is Bella saying fuck off to all the supernaturals and getting herself a normal boy.

Pjato really doesn't have a whole lot of bashing, but what is there is 50% Annabeth cheating on Percy so he can ask the gods to kill him, zeus denying it and instead ordering him to be the guardian/protector/caretaker/maid/living sex toy of the hunters of Artemis, falling in love with Thalia, Zoe, or Artemis herself(betrayal from the rest of the camp optional), and 50% is a Tyson complex 2.0 where a new camper shows up who may or may not be a sea spawn (aries is usually the godly parent when it's not poseidon), who proceeds to win over CHB and frame Percy of various crimes against grover/Thalia/stoll brothers/Katie Gardner that causes all his friends and his dad to leave him, then steal Annabeth, sometimes killing Sally and Paul for good measure, causing Percy to leave the camp and almost get himself killed, before being saved and recruited as the chosen leader of a universe defending team by Chaos, the primordial God of chaos. This team may include dead characters such as Zoe, Luke, Bianca, beck, and silena, and/or ancient heros such as Orion or theseus. The bashing in these fics tends to be more forgiving than hp or twilight, in that the bashed characters 'learn their lesson' and are forgiven by Percy, or were being mind controlled the whole time and so not at fault. There's also the occasional poseidon bashing fic where Sally dies when Percy is young, and he ends up on the streets where he is found by hestia/hades/apollo/artemis/etc and taken in by them as a child/champion, and poseidon is a huge dick who refuses to love him for whatever reason.

Incredibly surprising for such a massive and diverse fandom, the only type of bashing I've ever seen in avengers is post civil war fics bashing one side or the other, in defense of one specific character. e.g. Bashing Steve for "treating Tony terribly and betraying their friendship" and bashing Tony for "treating Steve/Bucky terribly and betraying their friendship."

This was probably not what you were looking for but whatever, I'll jump at any chance to rant about fanthropology.
