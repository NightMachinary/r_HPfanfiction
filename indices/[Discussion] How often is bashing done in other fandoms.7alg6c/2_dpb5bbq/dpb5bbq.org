I've read pretty heavy bashing in Naruto-fanfiction. It's mostly Sasuke, Sakura, Sandaime, Danzo, Kakashi, Minato, Kushina and the Konoha Council.

Bashing in Pokemon is often centered around those stories where Ash is betrayed or blamed for something.

Don't kwow about Twilight

Percy Jackson has many Zeus or Annabeth bashing storie. There are also Olympus as a whole bashing stories too.

I've read Lord of the Rings OC-Character or Tenth Walker stories where mostly only Boromir is bashed.

Star Wars has Obi-Wan and Yoda bashing when a story is Vader-centric.
