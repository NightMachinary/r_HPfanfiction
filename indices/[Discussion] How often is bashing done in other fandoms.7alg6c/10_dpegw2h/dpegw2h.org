From what I've read in other fandoms, the frequency of bashing increases as plot holes, personality flaws, and pairings that are mutually antagonistic with canon increase. At the same time, bashing decreases in general as age of fandom increases, and as size of fandom decreases. For something like the Worm fandom (which relative to Harry Potter), bashing is not quite rare, but uncommon, especially as the community at SpaceBattles and Sufficient Velocity greatly frown upon such excessive destruction of a character. On the other hand, something like Naruto will have much more bashing, but interestingly enough, not generally to as great of a degree as in Harry Potter.

I chalk up the degree of bashing to age and gender. Bashing people who are obstacles to the MC's harem is mostly done by guys. Bashing of only one character, someone like Ginny, for a Harmony ship, seems done perhaps more by girls. Bashing Ginny and the Weasleys, and perhaps Dumbledore is more by guys.
