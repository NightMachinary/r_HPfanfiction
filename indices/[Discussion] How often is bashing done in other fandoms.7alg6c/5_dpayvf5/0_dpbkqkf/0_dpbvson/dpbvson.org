Well, there aren't that many fanfictions of note except in French (see perhaps /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9727860/1/Della-s-Secret][Della's Secret]]/ and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6512139/1/The-Lost-Tomb-of-Pharaoh-Sedqaduck][The Lost Tomb of Pharaoh Sedqaduck]]/, for two extremely different approaches; both are at least goodish). The fandom is mostly centered around blogs and forums that discuss the official media, and debatably-legal scanlations.

Now for comics, there are of course the wonderful fancomics featuring Gladstone Gander and Magica De Spell created by Sarah Jolley, the amazing artist behind the webcomic /The Property of Hate/. They can be found [[http://modmad.tumblr.com/post/162014503130/duck-doodle-comics-masterpost][here]]. (Again, there's also some good comics in French and Italian but they're not translated.) I'll also drop [[https://elera.deviantart.com/art/Double-Standards-200470669][this]], [[https://elera.deviantart.com/art/Every-Week-With-This-174593272][this]] and [[https://scroogey.deviantart.com/art/A-Mysterious-Threat-Complete-608588245][that]] which are the comic equivalent of one-shots. Oh, and there's /Christmas for Two/ ([[https://dermitdemschnauzer.deviantart.com/art/Christmas-for-two-Page-1-425973813][page one]], [[https://dermitdemschnauzer.deviantart.com/art/Christmas-for-two-Page-2-425974338][page two]], [[https://dermitdemschnauzer.deviantart.com/art/Christmas-for-two-Page-3-425974559][page three]], [[https://dermitdemschnauzer.deviantart.com/art/Christmas-for-two-Page-4-425974749][page four]], [[https://dermitdemschnauzer.deviantart.com/art/Christmas-for-two-Page-5-425974967][page five]]), which I can't realy spoil but... /read it/.

DeviantArt and tumblr are filled with fan-art, but very little actual /plotting/. [[https://hyaroo.deviantart.com/art/Kazza-s-Disney-Meme-Fethry-Duck-633866933][Here's a nice Fethry thing.]], and all duckfans should check out the blog of [[https://mistermcdee.tumblr.com][mistermcdee]] and the [[https://tedjohansson.deviantart.com/gallery/43687465/Disney-ducks][DeviantArt profile of Ted Johansson]] at least once.

Again aside from things not in English, I think we have it about covered.
