Well, there's practicaly no bashing in the Disney comics fandom, but then it's not really constructed around written fanfiction quite as much... In the /Haunted Mansion/ fandom, there's "bashing" of the 2003 movie, but not of a specific character in it; and there's a neutral character called Leota who is often portrayed as evil in fanfics, but it's not really out of dislike for the character so much as a need for a villain combined with the fact that while not evil in canon, Leota is certainly more evil/ish/ than most other characters. The fans also don't like the character of Constance Hatchaway, but it rarely shows up as what we'd call bashing in fanfiction.
