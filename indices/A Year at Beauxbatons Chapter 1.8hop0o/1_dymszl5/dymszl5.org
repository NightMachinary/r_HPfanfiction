It flows quite a lot better than the first draft. The first six paragraphs could still be cut, though.

I would change the line:

#+begin_quote
  Of course, the woman's opinion was less that dirt to Harry
#+end_quote

to something like

*/Of course, Harry didn't care what she thought of him.../*

Because Harry very much cares when Marge starts shit-talking his mother.

And if they are traveling internationally, Portkey is the way to go. Otherwise, Gabriel can Apparate further than Voldemort can.
