I generally don't like fem!Harry, but this one I thought was good. That may have been because I understood a lot of the references about Myskatonic University, and things like the vorpal bunny (still makes me laugh!). Others may not have understood and didn't want to Google while reading, the Umbridge family being an offshoot of the whatever's for instance.

For me, my biggest problem was Harry calmly accepting his change in gender. For most people their sexuality plays a large part of their self identification. Even complete social outcasts have some sexual self-identity. I would have been much happier with a transparent & plot convenient line about how dimension hopping into Jamie magically altered Harry somehow, over the reason we did get, "I didn't have time to make social connections so I don't care."

Otherwise this is among my favorite stories.
