Basically, imagine if after the dementor's attack in book 5, Harry instead of waiting like a good boy, and the ministry sent 2 hit-wizards to arrest him, made him flee on his broom, causing a massive chase that ended up changing the future. Tonks is going to be his "sidekick/lover/sisterInArms" all in one, and Sirius, James and Lily have a darker past than canon, with a more proactive role in the war, following a impressive dude that doesn't bow to Dumbledore and is as scary as Voldemort to his enemies.

Not to mention a time-dilatation over Hogwarts that is making everything so bloody confusing.

that's Pretty much it without giving too many spoilers, and by that, i mean that the twists in this story are worth not reading any spoilers. At least IMO.
