Honestly, sounds pretty similar to Draco in my fic. A pureblood dies during CoS, which initiates his redemption arc. There is a riot at the World Cup, not by DEs, but by angry fans when Krum beats the muggleborn Irish seeker and wins Bulgaria the Cup.

Instead ot Hermione, Draco ends up with a halfblood girl that he'd picked on since they were kids (i just don't buy D/Hr; too fundamentally different, given that canon Draco likes wizarding culture and tradition, just not the violence and atrocities associated with defending it. Meanwhile, Hr wants to change a lot about the WW).
