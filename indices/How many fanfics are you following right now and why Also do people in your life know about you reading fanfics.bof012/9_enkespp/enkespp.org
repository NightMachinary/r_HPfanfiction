For a long time I was super weird about people knowing that i read fanfic cuz my mom caught me and I guess I was just inherently embarrassed I'm not sure why. This was middle school-high school. I didnt read much in college. Post college I've started up again and have been randomly casually mentioning it and I forgot why I was embarrassed.

Then I went home again for a weekend to visit my parents and as I just reading a fic on my phone in my bedroom and my mom came in and asked what I was doing. I said I was on reddit and then she like "oh I thought you might be reading fanfic" and I was like fuck, now I remember why I never told people.

She never said anything bad about it that i can specifically remember but i guess maybe her dismissiveness of it made me embarrassed to tell people.
