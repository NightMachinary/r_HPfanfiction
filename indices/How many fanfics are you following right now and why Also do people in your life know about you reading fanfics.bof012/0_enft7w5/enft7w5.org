I've got 87 stories on my ffnet story alerts list. 18 of those have updated in 2019. In addition there are a few active authors on my followed authors list.

Why? I think there are about 30 stories on that list that I consider at least good and that I want to read. There are a few that aren't great but I'm following because I picked them up early, gave early feedback and want to see how they turn out.

The rest are a mix of stories. Most were good once but aren't now but I still follow them because I've become invested in the story and want to see it through out of sheer bloody-mindedness.

I think most of my friends know about my fanfic habits. They probably all think I'm a bit strange because of it, but they probably all thought that anyway.
