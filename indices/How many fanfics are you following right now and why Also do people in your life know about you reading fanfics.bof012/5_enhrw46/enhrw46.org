I'm probably technically following far more fanfics than I think. If I really like an incomplete story and it's updated in the past few months, I'll have whatever site I'm on tell me when there's a new chapter.

Sometimes I'll get an e-mail about a new chapter for a story that doesn't even ring a bell. So probably anywhere from 20 to 200? Maybe even upwards of 500? I've been reading fanfic for a very long time.
