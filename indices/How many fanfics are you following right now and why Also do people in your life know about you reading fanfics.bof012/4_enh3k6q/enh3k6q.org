I am someone who is pretty much obsessed with stories, doesnt matter if its audiodrama (podcasts), books, series, you name it. I follow 3-4 ongoing HP fics and sometimes just reread one of my top ten. most of my close friends know about it but hey they still think regularly sitting together for more than 5 hours playing dungeons and dragons is weirder.
