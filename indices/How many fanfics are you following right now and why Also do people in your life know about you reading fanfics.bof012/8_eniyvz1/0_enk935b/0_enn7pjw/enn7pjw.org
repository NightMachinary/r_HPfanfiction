Sufficient Velocity and SpaceBattles forums (some of their authors crosspost to ffn, but many don't), Questionable Questing forum for NSFW or for people who think SV and SB's mods are tyrants because you can get away with a LOT on QQ, wattpad still has a little bit of a few people's older crap lying around (usually low-quality but not always), for some reason one author only uses tumblr, there's fimfiction for MLP stuff in general (only one or two things i follow there that actually update more often than once a year tho), one author only ever posts his stuff on PASTEBIN for god only knows what reason, and there was one fic that was only posted on deviantart but i stopped following that one a while ago after the grimderp got too severe

I'm positive I'm forgetting at least one other site.
