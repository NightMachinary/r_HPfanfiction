I'm pretty open about this stuff. All my friends know that I read and write Fanfiction, I even got one of my friends hooked by making him read HPMOR. Every once in a while I'll send the link of my latest fic for review and criticism, and to discuss about stuff.

I follow close to 20-30 fics at the moment, though I only have hopes of about 7-8 of them updating.

Why do you feel the need to be secretive about this?
