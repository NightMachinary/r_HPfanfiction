I don't have any marked down as 'follow' but I keep an eye on my (enormous) favorites list and organize it by last updated. That way I can keep easy track of any updates without random emails on my account popping up.

So in general there are six or seven actively updating that I follow and probably another six or seven that I hold out hopes of seeing update, someday.
