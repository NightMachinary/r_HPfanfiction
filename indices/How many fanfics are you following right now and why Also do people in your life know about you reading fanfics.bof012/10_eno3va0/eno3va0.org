No, I don't really tell people but honestly I don't care if they find out haha. It's just most of my friends and family aren't that into Harry Potter - my SIL is though! For me it's more that it's not going to somehow connect us, and I don't tell people about all the dumb shit I want on youtube either(plan with me's, Sims builds, etc) because there's no point? Unless they also watch it - I did connect with a colleague who mentioned the name of a Cleaning youtuber(clean with me's) and a teacher youtuber and that sparked an hour long conversation haha.
