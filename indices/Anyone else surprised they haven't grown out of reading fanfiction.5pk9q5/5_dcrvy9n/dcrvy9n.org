Little bit, but not shocked. I had a period of a couple years where I took a break, because I just got tired of it. These days I don't tend to read all that much FF, besides for what either fits my niche or is truly excellent.

I love reading, always have. It's been an escape in good times and bad. I also love the HP world, and there's a certain amount of nostalgia to coming back to it.

Doesn't hurt that I tend to only read fantasy/urban fantasy books written from a male perspective. I don't mind female POV in other genres, but reading urban fantasy as my main genre for a couple years has made me weirdly prejudiced towards them now. I was introduced to the genre by Anita Blake and Dresden Files, and very much enjoyed Dresden far more. When I went looking for more stuff like Dresden (from either male or female POV back then), I got burned out on the oh so common tropes in urban fantasy. I don't doubt that if UF had more male POV books, I'd have quit the genre entirely. Since it doesn't however, I haven't burned out completely yet.

My tastes /have/ changed as I've gotten older, it's just that those changes have pushed me more towards HP FF than away from it.
