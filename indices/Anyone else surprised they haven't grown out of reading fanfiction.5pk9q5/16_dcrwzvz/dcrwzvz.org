I'm kinda surprised that I'm still into fan fiction. My tastes have changed over the past ten years, and there is always new (somewhat good) content if you know where to look. Adding that with reread potential, I don't get tired of it.

However, there are times that I've gone months without reading anything, primarily because of RL obligations. Whenever I come back into reading fanfic after a hiatus, I like reading alternate endings and scenarios. HP is a universe with so much potential.

As long as authors keep doing what they do, I'll be reading and reviewing stories.
