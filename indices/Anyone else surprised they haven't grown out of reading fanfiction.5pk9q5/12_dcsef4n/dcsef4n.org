I'm definitely surprised. There's been a couple of times I've lightened up on the amount I read, and I burn out on fandoms on a cyclical basis (I'm just now going back into a HP phase after going through a largely Teen Wolf phase, and I suspect an Avengers binge in the future), but I don't think I've gone a full month without reading at least one fic since middle school.

The first two years I knew about fanfiction, I read sparingly, mostly because I only wanted to read Jacen/Tenel Ka fics. Then I found Animorphs fics, and Alanna fics, and I was hooked. Then HP came out, aaand that's about when I became a devotee. So it's been almost 20 years since I started reading fic, and 18 since it became a big part of my life. I'm 27, so it's not an exaggeration to say that two-thirds of my life have been spent with fanfiction as my main entertainment, which makes me wonder what I could've done with all that time. Especially because I have read a /lot/ of badfics in my time
