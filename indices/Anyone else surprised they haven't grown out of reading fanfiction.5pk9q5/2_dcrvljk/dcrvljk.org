I'm almost 29, but I've only been reading fanfiction seriously for about a year. I'd read a few stories from other fandoms in the past (alternative endings to the 1980's Beauty and the Beast TV series and spin-off fics about Rose and the human Doctor in the parallel universe from Doctor Who mostly), but I'd never gotten heavily invested in a fandom. And then Alan Rickman died, and I started really reading fanfiction. Now I read way too much, lol. I haven't read an actual book in months! I keep thinking that I'll run out of things to read eventually, but there's just /so much fanfiction/ I'll probably still be reading 10 years from now!
