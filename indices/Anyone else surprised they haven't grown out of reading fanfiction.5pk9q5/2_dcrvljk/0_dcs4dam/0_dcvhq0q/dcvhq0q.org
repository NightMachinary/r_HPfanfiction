Oh yes, that feeling when you realize that this seemingly endless ocean of fanfiction is actually dark brown from the shit, and you have to fish out a good fic.

I've been reading HP FF for what has to be 12-13 years now. Didn't realize what I was getting into when I first started, didn't even know what fanfiction was. Now I look at my list of fics I love, and while it is very long, I've already read them.

Finding new stuff that is actually good is a process of going through rec threads/searching on stuff like scryer, opening 50 tabs of potential fics, and then closing 49 of them (if I'm lucky) because only 1 wasn't terrible.
