28 here, and I really started getting into HP fanfiction at some point end of last year, when I stumbled over hpmor. Over the winter holidays I've absorbed thousands and thousands of pages on my trusty eBook reader. Two hours of public transport each day also helps, I guess. Quality is certainly fluctuating, and the amount of great, but incomplete and abandoned stories is quite sad - luckily, as you said, the sheer amount of stories certainly helps.
