I started reading Fanfic when I was around 15 and heavily into the Roswell fandom. I'm 30 now and still reading fanfic, but only HP fics at this point. I dunno, I would say if anything my tastes have changed in the sense I only bother with "really good" fics from writers who I think could publish quality original fiction. I do admittedly get a little embarrassed when my husband sees me reading fics.
