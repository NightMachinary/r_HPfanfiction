I agree and don't agree. I still love my fandoms and creating stories for them (not just HP either). Did I think I would stop entirely? Probably not, though I probably didn't think I'd still be completely obsessed with it.

You making this post made me realize that I've literally been reading fanficton for nigh on 22 years (yes you read that right 22 years). Literally since Windows 95 and a 24kbps dial-up modem (or was it 16kbps? It's been a while, and I was a kid :P ). I had to save text pages to /3.5" floppy disks/ so that I could read them offline.

Actually, I think some of those are still hanging around my mom's house if I can find a drive to read them.

Reading fanfiction involved out of a /very/ early love of reading in general. So I guess I thought I'd probably read /less/ but never stop entirely.
