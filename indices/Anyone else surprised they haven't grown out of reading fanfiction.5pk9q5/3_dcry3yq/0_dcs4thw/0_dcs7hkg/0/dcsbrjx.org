Fair enough. I started with Buffy fanfic after I was done with the show(same reason, super attached to the characters), and later Worm fanfic(again the same reason, plus setting). I spread out after that to Harry Potter(I like setting over characters here) and other fandoms because on spacebattles, quality fanfic is much easier to find.
