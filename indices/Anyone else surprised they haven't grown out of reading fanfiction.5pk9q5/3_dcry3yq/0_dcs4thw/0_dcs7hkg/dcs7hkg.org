I think the reason I latched on to Harry Potter is because you get so attached to the characters throughout the series. After reading it and loads of fanfiction, I find myself unenthusiastic to read new things because I feel like it's not worth it to try to get invested in new characters for one book and then done. Also, I think there is a lot more quality HP fanfiction just because of the number of fics compared to any other smaller fandom.
