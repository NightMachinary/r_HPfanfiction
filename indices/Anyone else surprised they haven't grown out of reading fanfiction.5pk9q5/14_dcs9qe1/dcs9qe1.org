I'm turning 40 in a couple years and I've been reading fanfiction of various types off and on since I was in my teens. Back then you didn't have such nice sites that compiled all the stories together like ff.net. We had to use newsgroups and email lists to get our story fix.

As long as people are still writing interesting stories people will read it. Fanfic, as we recognize it, has been around since at least the Original Star Trek tv show and "stories based on other people's works/worlds" has been around for centuries. Just look at how many people have written books about various supernatural creatures.
