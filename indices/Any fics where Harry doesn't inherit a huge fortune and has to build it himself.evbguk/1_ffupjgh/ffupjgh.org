It's very rare indeed. Even in 'revolutionary' fics such as "The Sums of Their Parts", Harry still relies heavily on inheritance to fight his wars.

[[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]] fics generally features a very rich Sirius Black who bankrolls good guys' political ambitions and war efforts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052), is perhaps the only fic I know that has Harry (and Sirius) building up their wealthy by themselves, albeit with illegal means. Basically, both end up in a new dimension. Potter wealth is off limit because the Potters are still alive, and Black wealth has all been squandered. Thus, they play esteemed Wizengamot members during the day, and rob their fellow rich Wizengamot members at night.
