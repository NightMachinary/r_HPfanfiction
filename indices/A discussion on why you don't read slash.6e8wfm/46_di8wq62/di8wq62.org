Yes I acknowledge that Draco does feel that way, but he's 12 is COS. How developed can his bigotry really be?

At that point, you can still realize you're wrong. I know people like this personally. Bigotry can be combated with knowledge, especially when your still at an impressionable age.

And shoot me for saying it. But that is an issue that's fundamental between Draco and Hermione. Harry should and of course does care. That's his friend. But he's angry on behalf of Hermione. Not because of anything Draco did to him personally.
