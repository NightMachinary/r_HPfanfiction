I feel like you've simplified the categories. I generally don't read slash since I'm not interested in male x male relationships, but if the story is not really focused on romance then I don't mind as much.

I avoid gay stuff because I like to imagine what's going on in stories in detail, but imagining the details of gay sex is not something I'm interested in. I also dislike lemons, even if they are heterosexual, so I may just dislike fics that heavily feature sex.
