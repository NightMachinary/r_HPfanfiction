I'm not one of those harem-seekers or slash-condemners, but I'd imagine that people generally tolerate more if the end result is something they find attractive, like the stereotypical fangirl loving pairings like Harry/Draco and Naruto/Sasuke or the average fanboy with dreams of harems and slave Leia.
