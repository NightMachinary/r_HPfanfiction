I'm fine with it being the main focus, but like you I don't like any "bad" characters being the romantic interest and I'm yet to find a Sirius/Remus that kept them in character and, well, not sappy. I haven't personally read any trans fics, but again that's due to my canon compliance thing. I would definitely be open to it if someone took a minor character that route.
