I think it's the angst potential, but then strangely they take all that angst, take the most moody, angst character ever (Sirius) and then turn him into a sugary, infantalised, melodramatic queen, pairing him with his long suffering, Cardigan wearing, chocolate obsessed Remus. Works on modern family, but not in angst fanfic tbh, and for me it seems to exaggerate their differences to the point where it wouldn't work? I tried reading Marauders of the Mind because I loved the concept, but the wolfstar in it was unbearable.

I've heard good things about the shoebox project but not yet got round to it. I'm on holiday soon so will add it to my list.
