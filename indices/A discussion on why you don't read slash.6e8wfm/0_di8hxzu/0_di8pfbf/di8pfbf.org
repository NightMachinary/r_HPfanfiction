agree. I'm totally fine with a slash minor character pairing, but just not the main focus. Also I find a lot of the men in HP slash pairings to be innately squicky. Snape, Riddle, Draco, Lucious, just make my skin crawl. Oddly I'm totally okay with Sirius/Remus mpreg. Unrelated but I guess sort of unrelated but on the LGBTQ topic: also totally okay with magic!trans, which is amazing that it is a Thing, though the 2-3 stories I've read with it have just been really well written.
