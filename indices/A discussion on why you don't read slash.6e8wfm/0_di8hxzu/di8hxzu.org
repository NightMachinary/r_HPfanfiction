I'm not really in either camp to be honest. I don't really like popular slash pairings (Harry/Draco, Remus/Sirius), but do like Dean/Seamus, Albus/Scorpius, and other minor character pairings, I just very rarely see anything recommended that I like the sound of and I don't read a lot of fanfic anyway, so I'm not going to go searching for it. I even wrote a femslash Padma/Astoria and have a vague Deamus plot idea in the back of my mind, but not sure it will ever come to anything. As I almost exclusively read and write canon compliant (or at least fics that /could/ be canon compliant), that sadly excludes much of slash.

Edit: I have to say I'm always mildly amused by the amount of people on the sub who will condemn slash for being ooc in one breath and ask for harem recs the next.
