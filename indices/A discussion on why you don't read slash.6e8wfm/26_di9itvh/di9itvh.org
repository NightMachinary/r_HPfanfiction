I'll bite. I read well-written fanfiction for good, believable plots and stories. The vast majority of what I read is "canon compliant" and extends the existing universe/story, like Northumbrian's stuff for example. I also sometimes read smut, because it's hot. Gay sex does not make me uncomfortable, but it doesn't turn me on or "do" anything for me, either. So with that in mind, slash is just not interesting to me as it generally doesn't fit in with canon at all, and doesn't give me the smut fix that I want when I do read smut.
