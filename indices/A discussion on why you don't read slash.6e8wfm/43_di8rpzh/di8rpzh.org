Only once have I come across a situation that seemed to be leading towards slash, or at least harry being romantically involved with a guy, and I was okay with it. It seemed like it was an appropriate extention to the relationship that existed between harry and the character. For those curious I'm talking about [[/spoiler][Harry and Orion Black in CÃ©st la vie]].

Other than that I've never read anything that has Slash since I imagine it caters to a need that I just don't feel comfortable with. I really wouldn't mind reading a story in which Harry gets romantically involved with a guy, but I just can't imagine it being anything but "fanservice" to something I'm a fan of. Most relationships Harry ends up in in the fics I do read, obviously with women, are like that, but they're straight (gheh) up my alley, so it works.

Other than general compatibility there's also simply the ickyness factor. To read something you have to (at least to some degree) Imagine yourself in that situation, and I kind of don't want to imagine being sensually assblasted by Draco Malfoy.
