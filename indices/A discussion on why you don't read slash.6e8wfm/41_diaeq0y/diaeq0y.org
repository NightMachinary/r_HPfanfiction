I'm not sure why but I cannot read het fics. When I read gen, and romance isn't main plot, but Harry still get a girl like Hermione for ex., I'm totally fine. I remember I liked their relashionship in one story so much, I tried top popular/best rated fics, but didn't get deep. Like, nope, not for me. Somehow just repulsive.
