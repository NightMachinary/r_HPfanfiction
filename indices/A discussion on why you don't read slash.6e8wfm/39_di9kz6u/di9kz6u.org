  The quality of writing with slash is often terrible, with extreme OOC-ness prominent.

Oh look, there's my problem. I actually read/lurk other fandoms and enjoy a variety of pairings, including m/m, which is why I bitch about slash in this fandom so much. It's not a hate borne of "ew, teh geys" but "ew, bad writing." /I've read better/ ... and my standards are high when it comes to any type of romance or smut, regardless of genders involved. How high? This linkao3(573857) high.

For me, it's a vortex of factors:

Inexperienced writers who lean too heavily on yaoi cliches; a deluge of pairings that are either extremely uncomfortable, implausible, or personally unappealing; being in love is suddenly the only thing that the main characters are about; men written as (crappily characterized) women; abuse = love; my parents hate my gayness; applying Muggle biases to wizarding society ... I could go on.

Also, like most pairing-focused fics, the plot is quickly lost in the relationship. Even romance genre stories need to have shit going on in it other than sex scenes. I want to read a story with a pairing in it, not a story all about the pairing -- just the same as I want characters who /happen/ to be LGBT, and not characters who are /only/ LGBT.

(Also, constantly fucking each other is not a personality trait -- it's goddamn boring, especially if the fic is /not/ categorized as a romance.)

I have similar problems with f/m (pick a popular pairing involving Hermione that doesn't involve Ron or Harry and you'll see what I mean). Less so with f/f, which has a tendency to be written by the target audience, for the target audience.

Finally, I write romance novels for a living. I do not like to read bad ones.

In the end, it's much, much easier (and less infuriating) for me to filter out romance altogether, and, by extension, slash, if I want to read a story with plot and semi-decent characterization. The only one that I've liked in this fandom has been linkffn(October by The Carnivorous Muffin) because it's so atypical.

Edit: Shoot, I linked that first fic wrongly.
