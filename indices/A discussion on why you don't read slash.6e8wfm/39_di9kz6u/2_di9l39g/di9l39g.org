  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux. AU, time travel, Death!Harry, slash

  Appalachian AU! In November 1973, Vietnam vet John Watson returns to his family's old home in Arthel County, West Virginia, deep in coal country. His low expectations include recuperation and boredom. Instead he finds a ruined landscape, a series of grisly murders, and one of the world's weirdest neighbors.Warnings/content: Some violence. Explicit sex. Tobacco-chewing. (Not all at the same time.)Huge thanks to beta reader bethbethbeth/Beth H! Best Original AU Winner of the 2014 Holmsies! Now featuring: The Bone Fiddle Fanmix! Music is the heart and the spine of this story, so here is over two hours of it. Traditional Appalachian music, period-appropriate rock, and atmospheric alt-country. All the murder ballads mentioned in the story are here.Beautiful cover art by songofthecuckoo. Thank you so much!
