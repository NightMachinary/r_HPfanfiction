Fanfiction is very much a fantasy game and both writers and readers like to put themselves in the place of their characters. In all honesty, I can't read any romance, slash or het, because not only can I not imagine myself being the character, I don't particularly want to be the character either. Having a harem sounds like an awful lot of work and stress, and the type of character who can manage it is the type of personality that I loathe anyways.

That aside, I honestly think that romance inspires silly tropes. Like Draco Malfoy. Why on Earth should we have slash with Harry and Malfoy, when they both hate each other with a burning passion, and Malfoy has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It is honestly a similar situation with the power trip fics, where Harry is royalty, richer than god himself, and can blow up the world by snapping his fingers. I really cannot identify with that, and I honestly believe that they are low quality and not indicative of reality.

However, I realize that my opinion is not universal. All the same, I am just going to avoid slash wherever I see it.
