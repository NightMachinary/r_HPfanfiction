I don't agree that there are just two camps. I don't really like slash but I will check out a slash fic if I find the premise interesting and I don't think that's too uncommon.

Although I rarely read them, I have found that almost every single one even if it does look interesting very quickly devolves into a mess, with OOC characters, a focus on bad smut and discussion on sexuality which I don't find at all interesting or something I want to read about. I just don't see Harry/Draco/Whatever as gay so reading their conclusion that they are gay seems extremely out of character and annoys me. Although even if the character is realistically gay, reading about it just doesn't interest me because it not relatable or fun to read. It's even worse when with no warning, two characters decide how hot the other person is and start making out for no reason. I don't like that plot line between hetero couples and definitely not the even more unrealistic slash version.

The only slash fics I tend to like usually have slash that is skippable or in the background. Slash fics tend to go massively OOC though and completely ruin their story. linkao3(The boy who died a lot) is a great example. It starts out with such a great premise, characters, good writing, its very fun to read and awesome, before the entire plot line gets derailed by slash that makes no sense, OOC characters and one of the worst pairings in the fandom.
