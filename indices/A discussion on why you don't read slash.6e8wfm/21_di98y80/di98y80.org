1) The feminization of the male character. It pisses me off how many times people write gay characters as flamboyant. I know gay and bisexual men who come off as "stereotypical male". Just because you bat for the other team doesn't mean the way the character speaks and walks and acts should pull a 180 and become an emotional mess.

2) Why does every plotline that involves a gay or lesbian character have to use the damn "you are special just the way you are and you shouldn't listen to what the bullies or what your relatives think" plot. I know this happens in real life but holy hell it's not the only story you can tell!

EVERYTIME THERES A GAY CHARACTER, THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO USE THIS PLOT!

Gay characters deal with the same shit as straight people.

3) Stop emphasizing that their gay or putting in dialogue that screams "WERE GAAAAYYY!". You don't see straight relationships doing that.
