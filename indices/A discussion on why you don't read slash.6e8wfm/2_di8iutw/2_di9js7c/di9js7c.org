This is pretty much me in a nutshell, except that I'm older than you. I fully support gay rights and being around gays doesn't make me uncomfortable at all. But when I read fanfics, the most important thing to me is to have a romance plot, and I want to see a hetero plot. It doesn't bother me to have a gay side character, but I want the main character to be hetero.

My wife (an English major) once told me that many female authors (including jk Rowling) used pseudonyms or initials to avoid showing that they were female, because while girls will read books about boys, the opposite is not always true. If that's true I feel guilty, but I wonder if that's going on here in a different way : gays will read straight fanfics, but straights don't do the reverse.
