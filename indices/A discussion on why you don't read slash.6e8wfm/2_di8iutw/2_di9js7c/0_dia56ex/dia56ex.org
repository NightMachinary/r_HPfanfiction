Another example of authors that do this is Robin Hobb. She used to write using her birthname Megan Lindholm and later switched to a pseudonym that was intentionally androgynous.

Another author, Krista D Ball, is very active on Reddit. She writes under her birthname, but comments a LOT on the challenges of being a female author, particularly in the fantasy genre, where people tend to assume anything written by a woman is romance/thinly veiled erotica. In addition, on [[/r/fantasy]], she makes lots of comments recommending different female authors, so if that is a part of literature you want to explore, definitely check out some of her posts.
