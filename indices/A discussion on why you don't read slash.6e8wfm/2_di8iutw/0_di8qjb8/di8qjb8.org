Gay relationships haven't been normalized in the public eye, it's not just you. When folks think of straight relationships, they're more likely to think of platonic touching, versus thinking of same sex relationships solely in terms of sexual touching. If you deliberately pay more attention to platonic touch between men and readjust your eye a bit, it may help normalize gay relationships for you a bit instead of your brain going 'two men kissing' =>naked dick riding.

Same sex relationships- it's not all about the sex. ;)
