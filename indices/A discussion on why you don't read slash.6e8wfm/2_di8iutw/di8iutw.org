I doubt that this is going to end well but here goes.

Romance is a very important part of fanfiction for me. I originally got into it because I was a fan of a particular pairing that never came to pass in the original work.

I'm a heterosexual male and I simply want to read stories about male heterosexual characters. I don't mind side characters being gay but i simply want the MC to be easily identifiable with and gender and sexual orientation are easy ways to do that.

I mostly read fics that feature romance (that's not to say that /only/ read romance but i like my stories to at least have romance in them) and therefore I generally stay away from slash.

But too be honest i think there's more to it.

I actually asked myself the very same question when i was in an introspective mood and i wondered why I was so averse to slash. Because that's what it is for me, an aversion. I don't just ignore slash but i actively avoid it, even if the plot sounds interesting to me.

As I said, I'm heterosexual and not even a little bi-curious but i'm also fairly young (21) and while I wouldn't consider myself sexually inexperienced, I'm also aware that there's a lot of things that I /do/ in fact know nothing or very little about.

So the first idea that came to me that i might be subconsciously repressing a sexual interest in my own gender. Suffice it to say that I've safely ruled this option out. I'm simply not attracted to men.

The conclusion i've come to is that I just don't like being confronted with it. I'm not a homophobe, I don't care what other people get up to in their bedrooms but I /do/ care if it affects me. I get uncomfortable if I see two guys engaging in PDA (and curiously enough i don't particularly care if it's anything other than two guys, be it a heterosexual couple or lesbians).

I've also been hit on by men before and i actually felt a little flattered. It's a very interesting situation for me personally, because I like to be aware of myself and my feelings and I just don't quite understand where they come from.

I think it might be because I oversexualize relationships in general and theerfore the idea of gay men makes me uncomfortable because the idea of gay men having sex does the same thing...

Anyway, i know this reads a little disjointed but this is something i've thought a lot about and I've never put it into word before so I apologize. I hope i haven't offended anyone and I'm genuinely curious if anyone has some input for me.
