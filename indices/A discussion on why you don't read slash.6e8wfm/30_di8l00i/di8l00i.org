Very true. I took a break from slash for a while, cause it felt like everything was trash. They can often ruin characters in an attempt to fit them into weird gender roles as well.

Someone recommend the Saving Conner series which has some of the best writing Ive ever seen. Thats is why I decided to explore that realm again. It's gotten a little better.
