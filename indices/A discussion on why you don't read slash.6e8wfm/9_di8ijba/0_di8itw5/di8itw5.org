Agreed. I can't really see Snape with anyone, tbh. Especially if it's not de-aged, time travel situation.

Draco/Harry? I've seen it done well. Alot of people see them as such a stretch, but are happy to see Harry with Bellatrix or Pansy.

I mean, I totally had a crush on someone I also simultaneously hated, so I think it's possible.
