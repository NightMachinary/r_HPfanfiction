I like it! I read a few time travel ones, and they kind of adorable, tbh. I like when you don't have to gank the characters in order to fit them into the relationship, which is every LV/Harry ever. I will read it, if its well written. (note: OOC doesn't always mean bad) But Tom just doesn't feel like Tom to me. Which is minus a lot of points.
