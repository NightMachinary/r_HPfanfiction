This is going to be quick as I really want to get to bed.

A lot of writers, whether good or bad, fall victim to the same things. All these things vary and each of them can ruin a fic in a split-second. I'll try and list them for you, but I am tired and I may just ramble on about things no one understands.

One -- *General Relationships*!

The major issue is that if the main character(s) is/are gay, everyone else seems to be as well. It's presented as an ‘Oh, you're gay? Well, so is everyone else' situation. It's unrealistic, but this is something a straight writer will not comprehend. I cannot speak for everyone, but I tended to question everything and everyone. I always debated whether people were gay and I'd prod at it. Most of the time I'd get weird looks and then I knew.

What I'm getting at -- although, rather badly -- is that there needs to be conflict or issues. Not everyone you meet is either gay or straight, but the probability of it is very slim. There are a lot of closeted people that will vehemently deny being gay because they're afraid. You can use this as a great character building example.

Nothing should, just like in real life, proceed perfectly.

Make the character go through 1 or 2 other people before finding out that their future partner is actually gay. Also, the HP worlds is mostly set in the 90's. People in my town were hunted and beaten for being gay. I'm not saying that it's not accepted, but I cannot see someone openly flaunting it.

The 1940's were worse.

Two -- *Sex*!

There's a lot of preparation that you never see. I understand no one, besides a select few, want to read about the ‘cleaning', but it needs to be thought about. Also, not all gay guys like anal. I know a few people that identify as ‘bottoms' and they would never participate as it hurts, even if the g-spot is hurt.

Not all bottoms are girls with dicks. They don't break into tears when their partner threatens them. Some gay relationships can turn into a full fist fight. Men can hit each other without being dubbed as abuse (well, it can, but y'know). The point is, stop making the bottoms act like girls whereas the tops are manly men. I have seen it reversed, not at all, and equal.

Three -- *Other*!

The relationship shouldn't be the focus if that's not the intention of your book. Don't change all the characters because of their sexuality. Sexuality does not define a person and you shouldn't act like it does.

Also, not all gay men pop a boner whenever they see another man naked. I cannot say how much I have seen, “And Harry walks into the locker room and omg erection! Dick! Ass!” Stop it.

Everyone is different and using their sexuality as a character trait is pathetic and cheap writing.
