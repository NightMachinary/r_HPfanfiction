Cause Draco is Draco. Okay I think this is the difference. It seems like you guys are searching for compatibility. Which is why Harmony seems to be a big thing for guys, it's like here's this person, we get along well, why not date.

If Harry dates Draco, they are on complete opposite sides of the fence. They hate each other. There is no way to ease them into anything, Draco probably won't ever be a "good" person in that sense, and the relationship would probably be layered with tension, arguments and drama.

For a teenage girl, that's more interesting/titillating, then reading Harry/Daphne which really doesn't come with any problems.
