Isn't there a girl!Draco? She's called Pansy. I mean, why hasn't the Het Fanfic community attached themselves to her and instead uses with a vast majority an almost OC (Daphne) for Slytherin pairings? Don't want to sound judgemental, but it makes me wonder. Blaise is available for example... yet instead most Slash writers seem to prefer horrible Draco.
