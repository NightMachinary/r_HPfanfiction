I disagree on that, Harry and Draco's differences go far beyond not liking each other. Draco, in the first books, is more a foil for Harry than a character in his own right. While Harry is humble, Draco is arrogant. While Harry has a genuine friendship with Ron and Hermione, Draco has Crabbe and Goyle as his goons, while Harry is unprejudiced Draco is a pureblood supremacist. There's just so much separating them that I could never imagine them together. A gay Harry wouldn't suddenly be attracted to an arrogant muggleborn-hating slimy git.

James and Lily were never that fundamentally apart. James just needed to grow up.
