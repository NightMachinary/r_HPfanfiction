Okay, this is my last thing in defense of Drarry, and them I'm just gonna let it go. But until 5th (really 6th) year, Harry and Draco don't even have a fundamental issue with each other. They just don't like each other. People who start off not liking each other date pretty often. I thought my first boyfriend was lame and a loser.

Lily Evans thought James Potter was arrogant and a jerk. I don't see how Harry/Draco requires the same suspension of disbelief that Snape/Harry would.

Okay, that's it. Gotta go down with my ship.
