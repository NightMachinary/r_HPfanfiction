I sail the good ship Harmony and always will, but I'll read anything that's well-written.

I love a good Haphne story, though, which can essentially be Harry/fem!Draco if done badly. But if fem!Draco had been an ass to Harry when they met I'd still find it unrealistic if they started fancying each other without something else happening to justify it.
