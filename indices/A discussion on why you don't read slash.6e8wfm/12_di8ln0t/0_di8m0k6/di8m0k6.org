Idk why Draco and Harry doesn't feel OOC to me. I realize I may be crazy, but to me they scream the whole rivals into lover trope.

If Draco was girl, would people feel this strongly?

Again, fully acknowledging that I'm may be mad/full of shit but those two sounds way more interesting than Harry/Ginny and their great life of boredom.
