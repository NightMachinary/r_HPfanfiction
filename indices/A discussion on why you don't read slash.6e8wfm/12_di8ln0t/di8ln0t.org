Because if you don't ask for no slash, then people start recommending terrible out of character Draco/Harry stuff to you. Just asking for no slash eliminates a big chunk of horrible fics since most of the main characters in HP are straight and writers often have to do a lot of mental gymnastics to explain it otherwise. Slash also tends to be pairings with characters who hate each other (and this is true in every fandom for some reason) in canon leading to even more OOCness.

I'd totally be down for a good slash Dumbledore story or a fic about someone else we don't know much about their sexuality like Charlie or something.
