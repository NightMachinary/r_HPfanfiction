I guess for me the main thing is that I can't really imagine the main characters as homosexual. I don't have anything against minor characters being in homosexual relationships, but when it's the main focus of the story I almost immediately lose interest. Probably because of my sexual orientation and the fact that I can't really relate to the relationship then.

Along with all this is the fact that if the story is slash then it is highly likely that it will be rubbish. I just immediately censor any requests I make to avoid all the trash, even with the chance of missing a gemstone.
