I think because I just find it kind of pointless? It's like if there was a whole genre of fic where everyone was Belgian. And it's like, no, the canon isn't Belgian, but it wouldn't be a big deal if it was. So it doesn't BOTHER me.

But the whole concept is generally just uninteresting to me, beyond some random background details in a story I actually find interesting.
