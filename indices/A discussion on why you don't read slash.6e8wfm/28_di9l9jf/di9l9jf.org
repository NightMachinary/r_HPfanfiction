As long as there is a well written story I'm perfectly fine with reading Slash. In fact some of my favourite fics do feature mild amounts of Slash.

Nevertheless, I won't search for Slash (for the same reasons I don't search for Draco/Hermione), read stories that are explicit or read unbelievable relationships (if it's not an AU or justified in some other form).
