I'm gong to keep this short as it's late for me, but, as a lesbian, I tend to avoid slash because it often leaves me feeling fetishizes.

Most slash doesn't have serious, emotionally grounded relationships. It's smut and not much more. And when it's being written by straight girls who think that gay relationships and 'isn't it so naughty?' To have Draco/Harry, I feel very icky about the whole thing.

There is good slash out there. And I have no problem reading the ones that don't leave me feeling icky. But I'll continue to avoid the ones that fetishize homosexual relationships.
