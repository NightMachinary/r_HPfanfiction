Its just my general experience with them. My refusal to read them is in the same vein as my refusal to read any more Lord Potter fics.

There is some slash out there that depicts gay sex in a way that /does/ make me feel uncomfortable. Because its horribly inaccurate. Then there is this weird section where gay men are depicted as these stereotypical pansy-queer types, which grinds my gears like crazy. Newsflash, being gay is a sexuality, not an entire character type. Same goes for the gay girls who seem to be allergic to any kind of femininity.

And finally, its the just awful, unexplained OOC-ness of so many characters in these fics, that it makes my skin crawl. +Tom Felton+ Draco is suddenly the hot and dark type with a tragic past in a family that wants him to be a blood supremacist be he sees the injustice yadda yadda yadda bla bla bla fuck off. Snape, Harry,... doesn't matter, the moment they become gay it seems their entire world circles around the fact that they're gay. If your sexuality is the only thing that defines you, you're a boring person, and if a character is primarily defined by sexuality, then its a godawful character.

Anyway. I think I've read /one/ slash fic that wasn't just awful for any of these reasons - but then had fucking magical cores in it to make me hate it.
