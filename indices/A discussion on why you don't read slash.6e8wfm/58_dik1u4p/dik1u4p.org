Before I start this I'll preface. I am a member of the LGBT community in my real life, far outside the internet. As an actual LGBT person, I hate slash fic.

For me it's half because too much of slash is as you said, terrible Quality writing. I have extremely high standards for what I read (guilty pleasure crackfics notwithstanding), and most slash simply doesn't hold up to those standards.

The other half is that I simply don't enjoy reading it; so I don't. It's just not my cup of tea. Same reason I don't read HarryxGinny, HermionexRon, and other pairings I don't like. If I don't enjoy reading something, then why would I read it.

In all, I feel like it's a personal preference thing that just like anyone else; I'm entitled to say "that's not my preference." Though admittedly I do feel a bit more entitled to say it's not my preference because as an LGBT person I'm out in the real world living through it as a part of my daily life.
