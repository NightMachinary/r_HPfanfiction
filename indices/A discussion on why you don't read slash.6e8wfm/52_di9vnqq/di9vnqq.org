I don't mind slash. There are so many other things to put me off that the slashy bits become insignificant. I'm fairly open-minded, so I have no problems with gay or bi. Harems are less believable.

Most of HP ff is rubbish, so naturally most of the slash fics are rubbish. The pairings are often even more unrealistic and unbelievable than the ordinary fics. Harry/Snape? Please. Harry//Voldemort?/ No no no. Harry/Dobby would be more believable, he's just about to hump Harry's leg in canon anyway. I'll never accept Harry/Snape, but write it well and I'll accept Harry/Firenze.

There seem to be more unrealistic pairings in slashfics than ordinary fics, perhaps because some imaginary moral line has been crossed. When you cross the gay line, why not go all out? Let's make /everyone/ gay! And perhaps a little MPREG?

Where are the believable pairings? Harry with Colin Creevey or Cedric Diggory, that I can believe. Especially Colin. I can see him sneaking into Harry's dorm at night and have his wicked ways with Harry, while documenting everything with his camera to show in the next fanclub meeting. Creevey is a bit Creepey.

Then there is the fact that few authors have any idea what gay sex is about. Or any sex, really. I can understand that the graphic depictions gloss over the sticky bits, but real life sex is nothing like porn movies. If you write it detailed, at least get it halfway believable. My own imagination is superior to whatever sordid details the frustrated teenage mind of an average author invents.

So, after ignoring the adolescent fantasies, the wildly improbable pairings, the ridiculous bits (like MPREG), we're left with a handful of fics. And I haven't found any of them yet, so for now I usually ignore anything slashy.
