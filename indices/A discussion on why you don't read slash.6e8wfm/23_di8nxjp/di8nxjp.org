If it's for narrative fiction, then I enjoy reading stories about people I can identify with in some way. As a heterosexual, heterosexual relationships are things I can identify with in ways that homosexual relationships aren't. If its just smut, then I'd be reading it for...science and man on man sex doesn't do it for me, scientifically speaking of course.
