Honestly when a fic has slash in the description, I'll avoid it because it's normally popular characters- Harry, Snape, Draco, etc. I can't see any of these characters together in the same way I can't see Harry/Pansy. On the other hand, I ship Dean/Seamus, Lavender/Parvati, and like Percy, Nott, Neville, Sirius and Charlie in gay relationships, so I don't know if this is the same as outright not liking slash.
