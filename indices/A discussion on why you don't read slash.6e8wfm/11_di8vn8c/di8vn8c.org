Generally speaking, I think I fall more towards the first type. As others have mentioned, there are a truly ridiculous number of terrible fics that feature slash. More importantly, perhaps, is that most of the more common slash pairings are absolute shit. Why would you pair Harry with Draco, someone who has ardently argued for the extermination of people like Harry's best friend? Or Harry with the ugly teacher -- Alan Rickman was too goddamn gorgeous to play Snape, as much as I loved his voice and acting -- who hates his guts and constantly acts like a petulant child? Or Harry and Lord Voldemort, the guy who literally killed his parents and tried on several occasions to kill him? And so on. The characters are almost always out-of-character to a truly heinous degree, and the relationships are far and away the most important part of a story for me. I'd argue it's like searching for a needle in a haystack, except it's shit instead of hay. That's not to say that I won't read slash solely on principle, but... well, it's a bit like finding a fic that features some terrible trope like indy!Harry. Occasionally it can be done well, but 99% of the time I will wind up hating it and regret wasting my time.

On another note, part of what I like about the romance is the cuteness. In romance fics, I generally find the actions and reactions of the girl(s) involved far cuter and more interesting than those of the guy(s) -- perhaps because I can relate too well to all the missteps committed by men that are usually featured in said fics, and perhaps because I am attracted to girls and therefore naturally find them cuter and more interesting. I can squee over Harry and Hermione getting together because I find Hermione to be a romantically appealing character, not so much because I like Harry.

Does that all make sense? To be honest, I've been reading fanfiction for so long (and yet read so few slash fics) that I honestly don't even think about it anymore.

EDIT: And the far-too-common mpreg makes a fic so unrelatable as to be completely bizarre. Men don't have the necessary equipment for carrying a child, nor do they have anything even remotely similar. It takes the little suspension of disbelief I muster and repeatedly smashes it with a hammer.
