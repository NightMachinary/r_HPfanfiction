Hmm. I have defended Drarry already, so enough of that. Het romance can really bore me for the reasons you described. It seems all surface level. I need some kind of strife, and not in the stupid rom com way.

But in the Harry is fighting for his life kinda way and he needs someone useful. There are definitely Het fics that do this. But I can only think of two off the top of my head

And you totally makes sense.
