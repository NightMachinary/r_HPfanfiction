I am a gay man. I started reading fanfic when I was 12 or so. I am now 29.

A lot of fanfiction is shit. Het, slash, gen...doesn't matter. A lot of the people writing fanfic are teenagers and a lot of them write adult characters from within the scope of their own experiences. They sound like teenagers. A lot of people writing gay male romances are women, and a lot of them also write from within their own experiences. They sound like girls. There are exceptions and I have read plenty of good fic by teenagers and plenty of believable male/male romances by women, but the bulk of it just doesn't work for me, especially when two guys act like teenage girls. I can think of some very popular fics that fall into this but are loved anyway because...I guess most of the people reading and raving about them are teenagers, girls, or both? I dunno. No judgement from me if they like it, but I'm gonna pass. Even stuff I read and loved as a teenager, desperate for characters I could identify with and explorations of relationships like the ones I wanted, I often go back to reread and think "wow this story is bad". As for the smut aspect...meh. If I want porn, there are better places to find it than Harry Potter fanfic. Bad sex scenes are worse than no sex scenes.

One of my favourite m/m stories ever, one that blew my mind as a teenager and made me start being a picky reader, was the Snape/Lupin story 'Third Time's the Charm' by Helenish. They acted like guys.

I will read any pairing and probably enjoy it if it's well written.
