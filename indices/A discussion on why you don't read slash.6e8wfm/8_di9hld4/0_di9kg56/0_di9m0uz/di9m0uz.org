My comment there made me sound kinda dismissive, but I genuinely do love fandom and fanfic and have read loads of amazing stuff. It's just that as you get older, you find yourself able to relate to adult characters more and when they are acting like kids, it really stands out.

The biggest instant "nope" for me is all the guys crying at the drop of a hat and calling each other loads of pet names. Remus Lupin is not going to call anyone "Siri" unless it's an AU where he lives to buy an iPhone.
