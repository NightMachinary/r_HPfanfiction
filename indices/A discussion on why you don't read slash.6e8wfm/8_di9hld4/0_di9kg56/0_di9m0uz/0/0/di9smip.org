Oh yeah, I know that adult hetero relationships aren't like this either - even though sometimes the insane sap is written by adults for god knows what reason. I can totally get behind the behaviour if it's in character or made believable in some way - and with the exception of "trans character au" or genderbendy type fics, I will read any pairing or AU or trope or whatever.

I also get creeped out when the author uses slash to mindlessly bash characters or canon pairings they don't like.
