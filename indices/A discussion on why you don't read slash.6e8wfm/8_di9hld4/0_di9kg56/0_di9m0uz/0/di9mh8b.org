I didn't think you sounded dismissive at all. What's interesting to me is that het relationships aren't overly like this either.

I don't know any relationships with crazy nicknames. Its just babe, or something. What I've just realized is that it's a teenage fantasy about a relationship in general het or slash. Ive rarely seen anything that resembles what I have with my boyfriend.
