It's not as if I don't read slash as a rule - I've written a Harry/Hermione/Ron story myself, and not in the "Hermione/Harry+Hermione/Ron" sense - but as others said, most often, Slash involves Draco or Snape, and those are not exactly my favorite characters, especially not when it comes to romance. And I'm not interested in reading about Marauders in school either, so that already cuts out most of the "Wolfstar" stuff.
