If it's side character slash I can read it when it's well written but if the main romance is slash I avoid it. Romance in general is something I am a bit iffy on because there are many times where it simply takes over the story If I'm reading romance and it's the main drive for the story I bail if there's romance it has to be a side thing for me. Slash tends to fall into the "Main drive for story" category so I steer away from it. A few things I can't read no matter are

Harry/Hermione

Harry/Ginny (50/50)

Harems (Crazy amount 2-3 are okayish depending on the story)

Slash

Also, slash most of the time is just highly unrealistic
