Because I'm completely homophobic of course ! ... no seriously, I dont want to read fanfiction for romance, but for the plot. I sometimes read fics with a good plot, that feature slash, but just as background in the story.

Most of slash fics just scream "Come and watch absolutely farfetched gay romance !" rather than "Come and read a good story, that may contain slash". That why I usually dont read slash.

On a side note, stop with Harry/Snape, or worst, Harry/Voldemort. It's called pedophilia, and it is disturbing, even in a fictional story.

Edit : In prevention to critics screaming freedom of speech, and freedom to read whatever the hell they want, I completely agree, I do have those too. You are interested in reading gay romance, it's your right. People can have different tastes, and refuse to read stories featuring gay relationships, but dont let anyone tell you that YOU shouldnt read what you want to read.
