I love slash, but agree with what a lot of the anti-slash people are saying in here about the popular HP slash pairings. I've dabbled occasionally in Harry/Draco just by virtue of the fact that there's /so much/ of it and it has extremely talented writers like astolat writing for it, but in general I have little to no interest in any Deatheater/Slytherin pairings, and they make up the majority of popular HP slash pairings.

Remus/Sirius, on the other hand, I adore. Along with Steve/Bucky in the MCU fandom, it's one of my favorite ships ever. I love the Friends to Lovers dynamic, and Remus/Sirius is a very diverse ship with a lot of variety in the fiction that appeals to me, because it was clearly /not/ a perfect friendship, even though it was a deep one, so you've got everything from the fluffiest fluff to the most soul-crushing angst and all gradients in between. There's cute MWPP-era pranks and fluffy falling in love, there's /The/ Prank, which probably laid the foundations of whatever lack of trust caused Remus to believe that Sirius could have been the one who betrayed James and Lily, and the subsequent tensions of the First War, there's Lost Years where Remus mourns the loss of his friends, there's Laying Low at Lupin's after PoA, there's Bring Back Black and other fix-it fics... Like I said, tons of variety, and across several different eras, too.
