I will agree with you on certain points, but how does sexuality make one vastly OOC? Someone's whole personality doesn't change cause they're gay/bi/pan. ..and another more general argument. We can do Lord Potter Black, We can do 10-girl Harems, hell, Harry can be raised by goblins and all of that is fine, but slash is the deal breaker of unrealisticness?

To me, I don't see someone being attracted to the same sex all that radical.

But, I can acknowledge my bias. As a bi/pan person, I don't know what its like to not feel attraction to certain sexes.
