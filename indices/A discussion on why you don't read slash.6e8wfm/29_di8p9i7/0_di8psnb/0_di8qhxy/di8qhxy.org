Lord Potter Black is dumb the vast majority of the time because again, Harry goes super OOC. Sometimes it can be done well, but you had damn well better rebuild the world from the ground up to have it make sense that all these magical lords are running around. Harem stories are SUPER dumb, because I don't know of any girls who would be even a little OK with that idea (or guys for that matter if they had to share a girl). The only reason to read haram stories is titiliation, not for the plot. I might be excited by a haram story, but I would never be titilated by a slash story.

Harry raised by goblins would actually be pretty cool, because at least then you have a reason for his character to be dramatically different. Heck, that might even be a story where slash would make sense if the goblins instill those values in Harry. Wait, never mind, I read Harry Crow, and that was pretty dumb too.

Sexuality is a core component of someone's character and it determines the lens by which they view relationships and the world. Changing that about someone is something that you have to have a damn good reason to do, and frankly the reason their sexuality changed is probably more interesting to explore than writing graphic slash scenes anyway.

The big problem with slash is that by their very nature most slash stories make the slash the core component and most interesting part of the story. If you're already not interested in reading a really OOC slash story, they often don't have much else interesting about that that isn't resting on the fact that the characters are gay.

This is why in my stories, I change something then spend the rest of the story exploring how this would affect Harry and his character and change the world around him. Harry raised by SAS operatives? Better not have a basilisk show up year two and start petrifying people because there is no way the timeline didn't have a major shift. Harry bitten by a werewolf at the age of 6? You'd best not have a troll showing up on halloween 1991 because things are different now? Harry with red hair? Alright, who gave me those drugs again and why am I still writing this crack fic?

Anyway, if you can list for me slash stories where there is a compelling reason for the characters sexuality to change, the universe is impacted in a major way so the stations of the canon no longer play out in the same tired old way, and people's personalities are still in line with canon will reflecting the growth and change this new timeline would have wrought, I would be willing to read them instead of yet anohter fic where Harry and Draco hate each other right up until they're riping their clothes off.
