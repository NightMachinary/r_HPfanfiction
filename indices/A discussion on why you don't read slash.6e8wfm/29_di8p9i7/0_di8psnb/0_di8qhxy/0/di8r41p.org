"Sexuality is a core component of someone's character and it determines the lens by which they view relationships and the world."

Disagree. I don't see how Harry has to go about his life any differently, because he may or may not be attracted to men. In fact this is the recipe for an awful story. Where the author makes Harry completely different, just cause he like boys.

He's still a Gryffindor, he still has to defeat LV, he still was abused by the Dursleys. Maybe in addition to all that he finds Cedric mildly attractive cause he a hormonal teenage boy, and it goes like that sometimes. Doesn't make him a different person.

I like girls, and although that may change how I react to particular situations, I'm not so different than when/if I was straight.

Why does there have to be a "compelling reason" for sexuality to change. It's not a light switch, dude.
