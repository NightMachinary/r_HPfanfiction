Hmm. Okay, thats an argument that we can't have, about whether something is fundamentally different about your Psyche if you're gay or not.

I'm in this school. Sexuality is a spectrum. You can be mildly attracted to someone or majorly. There doesn't HAVE to be any rhyme or reason to your attractions and they dont have to be serious, but they can be.

So I do think a story should be developed. You can't go from him and Draco hating each other to being fine and dandy. However I do think that when they are written as themselves without major alterations they complement each other.

We may have to agree to disagree
