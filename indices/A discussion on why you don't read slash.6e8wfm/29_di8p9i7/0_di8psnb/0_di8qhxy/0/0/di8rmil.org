No, it's not a light switch. That's why it takes something to change it. You can't flick someone's sexuality on and off, there is something deep within the psyche that changes. Why, if everything else about Harry is the same, is he suddenly gay? There is no reason given, no core part of his character that has subtly shifted. I agree that making Harry completely different just because he likes boys as dumb. Your'e working backwards. He should like boys because he is very different; his life experiences and psychology have changed and there needs to be a reason for it.

If your sexuality did change (which is an entirely different argument I have no desire to have as to if people's sexuality can change), then it is because you as a human being grew and developed in that direction. Something about your growth and development led you in that direction. If you are approaching this from the argument that sexuality is inherent, that's fine, but then why has Harry changed? Are his genes subtly different? If so, surely this has changed how he views the world and his relationships along the way.

If we are sexually attracted to someone, we perceive and react to them differently than if we find them uninteresting. If Harry is gay, you need to change how he reacts to the boys and girls, because there are going to be major changes to how he views and interacts with them. As you said, this is not a light switch, you cannot throw it and have just one aspect of Harry change. This is a core part of his psyche and it needs to have lasting impact on the character.

This is the problem with a lot of slash stories: they just flip the switch. They are then uninteresting for the same reason that stories that have "Harry starts sleeping with girl x because reasons" stories are uninteresting. Why is Harry suddenly very attracted to this new character? What about him has changed? Explore that and its consequences and then you have a good story.
