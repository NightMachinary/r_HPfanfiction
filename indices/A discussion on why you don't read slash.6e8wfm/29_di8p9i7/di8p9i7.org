There simply is no way to write the majority of the major canon characters in slash stories without making them really OOC, with the sole exception of Dumbledore (and that I would be fine with). This is especially bad since the vast majority of slash pairings feature Harry with either much older men, or with Draco. None of those scenarios make any sense. The same goes for any of the other kids Harry's age. I could see a Dumbledore/Tom Riddle story if you squint reaaaaly hard, but frankly Tom was portrayed as mostly A sexual so even that wouldn't make sense.

The simple fact is there are not an abundance of gay characters in HP canon, much like in real life where homosexuals make up a very low percentage of the overall population. If you want to write slash that's fine, but to me at that point it really stops being a Harry Potter story and is just author wish fulfillment that has people with the same names and sort of the same setting.

Plus, I generally find stories that feature a lot of underage sexuality to be very uncomfortable and stay away from them. Hand holding and kissing is fine, but anything more than that and you should really be waiting until they're of age for that level of relationship.
