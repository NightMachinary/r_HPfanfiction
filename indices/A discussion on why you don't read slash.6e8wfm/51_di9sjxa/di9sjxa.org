I'm ambivalent to slash. However, I'll drop a story if there is any form of mpreg. That concept makes no sense to me, even with magic.

Idk if this makes sense, but I like emotional slash. I don't care much for lemons so if there are any I just skip the scene. When looking at HBP in a different light, Harry's obsession with Malfoy can be construed as a crush he doesn't realize he has. He even tracks Draco's movements ffs. In CoS, Draco's rant about Harry to his father can also be hilariously interpreted as an unconscious crush. It's easy to twist stuff like this into a romantic premise.

With that being said, a lot of slash is very OOC, but there are decent slash fics that are IC, epilogue compliant, and don't have any bashing. They are just harder to find.

A lot of the responses here question why Harry/Ron isn't a popular slash pairing. When I read the books, Ron comes off as very het, especially during the Yule Ball scenes and his reactions to Hermione's perceived sexual activity in the books.
