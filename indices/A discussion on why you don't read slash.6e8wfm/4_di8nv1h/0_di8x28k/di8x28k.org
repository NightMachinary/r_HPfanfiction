You made most of the points I've thought on writing. As a writer who ships mostly slash pairings, but still reads and writes different ones, I can say this is what truly bothers me.

And I will add to the Dom/sub thing: many people who don't know about m/m real life relationships think that one must be the Man(TM) and the other will be the Boy who needs to be guided and patronized by his significant other because of their inherent femininity. I really hate this and it happens usually, mostly with the already mentioned Snape/Harry and Voldemort/Harry. It also happens in Remus/Sirius fics, along with the mate stuff, which is why I haven't been able to find good fics on werewolves involving Remus.
