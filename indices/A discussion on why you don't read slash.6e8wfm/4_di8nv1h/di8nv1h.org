My problem isn't with teh buttsecks.

My problems are more nuanced.

First, with the power imbalance inherent within 99% of slashfic. A good chunk of it involving Harry ships him with an adult male while Harry is younger, or with someone like Voldemort. That squicks me. Knowing that consent cannot legally occur when you hold power over someone makes these fics tantamount to rape in my eyes. This is before you even involve the adult/child aspect which is flat out worse. Why is Harry/Snape an acceptable pairing to the slash community yet Harry/Sprout is thought of as being absurd to the het?

When the terms Dom/Sub are involved, knowing that the author likely knows less about d/s relationships than the hack who wrote 50 shades, it is laughably bad. I am not wasting time there.

My next complaint is creaturefic or mpreg. It is just impossible for me to get into this knowing that it isn't supported by canon (the first), is nearly always bad writing (both) and is biologically impossible (mpreg). I am immediately out on both of these subsets, which tend to trend to slash.

Next, I hate "mate" stories (usually a sub-subset of creaturefic) for the same reason. I have stated my distaste of fics which remove free will as a trait of a character as lazy writing (also why I hate most marriage contract fics) so I just don't read it.

Finally, I have seen too many abuse!Harry stories where he is raped, then decides he is gay. I cannot even begin to tell you how wrong this is. Abuse is abuse and does not necessarily determine your preferences. Harry whoring himself for money because he is a runaway does NOT necessarily make him gay or prefer men.

Now that we have reduced it to people having consensual relationships with other people of their generation and/or consenting adults, my final objections are that most of the slash I have read simply isn't set up well. Harry wouldn't suddenly decide to be/realize he is gay (I have seen it presented both ways in fics). If he did, he wouldn't be a cartoonishly gay stereotype within a chapter or two. If the characterization is appropriate and logical, I have no problem with it. If he goes on a date with Cho then immediately wants to kiss a boy in the same chapter with zero lead in, I am out. Of course, I have the same response for womanizers in fanfic.

If you want slash to be worth reading, make the writing better. If your Harry is gay but your fic starts fourth year and is "canon compliant" then you'd better add some flashback scenes exploring the change/deviation from his canon personality, which is straight cis male as written.

Tl;dr: Most of the writing is shiatty, so I don't waste my time.
