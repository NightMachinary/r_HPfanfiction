If you want to try one, there's Luck in the Shadows by Lynn Flewelling. It's a six book series, but I kinda lost interest after the fourth - not that they're bad by any means, I just usually have to take breaks reading long series like that.

Another one is The Traitor Beru Cormorant (which [[/r/fantasy]] was obsessed with for like 6 months) which features a wlw romance and I personally really enjoyed.

There's also Song of Achilles which is basically the Illiad from the eyes of Patroclus. It's been hypothesized that the two were lovers but we have nothing explicit confirming that, and this book plays off of that. I personally thought it was probably 3/5 stars, but lots of people love it so you may too.

If you want more recommendations, this is an area of fantasy I'm (obviously) quite interested in and can give you more.
