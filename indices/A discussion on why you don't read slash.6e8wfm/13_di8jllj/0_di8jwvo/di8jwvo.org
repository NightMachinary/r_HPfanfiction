  or an actual fiction book

This is actually rather interesting to me. I've never consciously avoided fiction that features gay couples but I also couldn't name a single book i've read that has main characters in a homosexual relationship.

I mostly read fantasy and sci-fi and there's a ton of background, almost token, gay characters but it seems to me that most main characters are heterosexual, especially the men...
