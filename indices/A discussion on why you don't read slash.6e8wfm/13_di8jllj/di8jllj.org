I guess mainly it's because I'm just not used to it, per se. I've never read anything of the sort, being FanFiction or an actual fiction book. And I don't really have any interest in doing so. Whenever I see slash on FanFiction, I ignore it (I look at the pairing if it's provided) but nothing in me tells me to click on the story to see what it contains - I just move on. It's just not my cup of tea (though, again, I never really tried reading a slash fic before).
