Like a few people have mentioned already, I don't really out right /hate/ slash, but all of the major pairings for it tend to make me really uncomfortable when I read them. I mean the thought of Draco, Snape, Voldemort, Lucius, etc. getting it on with harry in any context, kinda just feels offputting to me. I've tried reading a few slash story's, or rather as you said good story's with slash, but I've yet to find a story like that, that I can enjoy.
