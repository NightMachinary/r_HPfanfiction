For me, it's just really hard to associate myself with anything other than a straight male MC. I just don't have the interest in any form of slash, whether gay or lesbian. I can't form a emotional connection to the MC if I can't mostly identify with them. I lose interest really quickly in a fic once it gets tracked off the MC so a fic with a MC I have a hard time relating too is almost an impossibility to get into.
