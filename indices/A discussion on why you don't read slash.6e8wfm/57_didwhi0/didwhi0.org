This is a great thread! I've thought a lot about it myself, as I actively avoid slash stories but don't have a problem with depictions of gay sex (I was a Queer as Folk fangirl at age 13, and still watch it at age 29!). Like so many other commenters have said so eloquently, it just doesn't appeal to me. If the characters aren't gay in canon it's really difficult for me to get into. Maybe once or twice I've found a decent slash fic that didn't make me cringe with how OOC everyone and everything was. Meh.
