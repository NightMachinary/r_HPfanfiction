I don't read slash because I'm not interested in it. First of all, I'm hetero, so I have little interest in the details of homosexual sex. I can stand to read slash if it isn't shoved in my face very thirty seconds and has an interesting plot.

Thus, my major problem is this : the vast majority of HPslash is not, in fact, story. Just an excuse for two men to have sex. I can count on one hand the number of slash fics I have found that I believe to be worthy of reading. I should note, however, that I refuse to read a great many heterosexual stories that are often recommended here for the same reason. I don't read stories for the sex; I would go watch porn if I wanted that. It's just that slashfics tend to have a disproportionately high number of fics that have no plot beyond sex. Lots and lots of sex.

Moreover, from what I've been told by friends of a different sexual orientation, slash writing /isn't how it works in the real world/. The relationships aren't realistic, nor is the sex (still wouldn't read it if it was). The vast majority of it is written by teenage girls with little or no idea of how such a relationship would actually work.
