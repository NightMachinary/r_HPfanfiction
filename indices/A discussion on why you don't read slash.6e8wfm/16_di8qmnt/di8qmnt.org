I'm neutral to slash as an idea. But I've never encountered a good slash fic. Most I reject on the description phase, they are usually random shipfics with "some convenient plot device forces characters together", I hate this in hetero fics, and I hate this in homo fics.

Then there are things I've read. Sacrifices Arc had abyssmal pacing and annoying angst so I've dropped it. Leo Inter Serpentes was a canon rehash, dropped. Butterfly Wings was much better than what "Snape is Harry's father" would imply. But the pairings were a part of the terribly boring second part and contributed to its boringness. So while the fic was decent, it actually would be better without slash (or anything romance related at all).

Maybe I will encounter a good one someday.
