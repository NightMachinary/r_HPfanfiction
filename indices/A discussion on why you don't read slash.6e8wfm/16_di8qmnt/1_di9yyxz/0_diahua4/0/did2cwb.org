Let Perpetual Light is very good. There are others with the same pairing - [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7101118][Thirty-five Owls]], [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9042050][82 years]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/76683][As Human as to Breathe]]. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2428940/chapters/5375627][L'optimisme]] has some great florishes in the writing that appeals to me, but it is also generally overwritten and the characters are off.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]] is set in the Voldemort ruled seventh year, features the ministry six plus Draco. I quite enjoyed the character dynamics, minus Hermione being nails-on-a-chalkboard levels of irritating occasionally. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6435092/1/Turn][Turn]] is really high quality writing, a wonderful portrayal of family dynamics and themes that resonated with me, even if I didn't particularly care for the actual romance. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6177703][House Proud]] and other fics by Astolat are also very good, from what I remember.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/241474/chapters/371479][Reservoirs]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12078322/1/love-and-lycanthropy-and-other-institutions][love and lycanthropy and other institutions]] are good Remus/Sirius fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7985679/1/To-the-Waters-and-the-Wild][To the Waters and the Wild]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6996054/1/Dreams-and-Darkness-Collide][Dreams and Darkness Collide]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10311215/1/October][October]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10241474/1/In-Wonderland][In Wonderland]] are all relatively unusual Harry/Tom Riddle fics. They're all three star fics and flawed in various ways, but I enjoyed reading them nonetheless.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/users/mad_martha/pseuds/mad_martha/works?fandom_id=136512][Mad Martha]] has a bunch of Harry/Ron fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5519225/1/The-Abysmal-Dating-Life-of-Harry-Potter][The Abysmal Dating Life of Harry Potter]] is hilarious, but I would only recommend it if you don't mind Hurt/Comfort stuff. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/979182/chapters/1927380][Cartographer's Craft]] is Harry/Sirius with time travel which has been generally well received and is on my reading list.

I don't care for any of the sexual stuff in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10370211/1/Elegy-for-a-Goat][Elegy for a Goat]], but all the other character stuff is fascinating. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/94150][Three of Cups]] is something similar.
