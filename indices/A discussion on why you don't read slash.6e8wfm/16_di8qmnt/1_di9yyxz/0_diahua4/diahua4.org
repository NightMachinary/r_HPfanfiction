See the post for what I actually tried to read. I regularly scour recently updated fics on FFN for new stuff to read, and basically everything is rejected on summary alone. I also have Let Perpetual Light in plan to read.

Ah, I forgot about Where Loyalties Lie, which I assume ends with Cedric/Harry, dropped this one because of overwriting everything and bad grasp of characters. Oh, and there was Man-eaters of Kumaon. Now that was overwritten, with whole chapter about Remus' current house being poor, dirty and ugly.

You can recommend me some, seeing as you seem to know some good ones.
