I suppose it depends on /why/ you refuse to read hetero romances. It's pretty much the same question that OP asked so feel free to give us your opinion.

I am curious though. Does this only apply to fanfiction or do you limit all your reading choices that way? If so, i'd be interested in a few recommendations on fantasy and science fiction with gay main characters. I likely won't read them but i am rather interested in how many there are and how people they are.
