I only apply it to fanfiction, because I tend to read fanfiction for comfort and familiarity. Romance that I can relate to is a very big part of that. I'm gay, and I'm generally happy with both slash and femslash because it's enough for me that they are same-sex dynamics.

It's not as important to me when I read other things, because if it's something of literary fiction, then I'm up for an emotional challenge, if I read fantasy I'd probably be in an "exploring" mode enjoying a new world. Pairings that match my preference aren't a priority then and of course I'd have a very hard time finding them anyway.
