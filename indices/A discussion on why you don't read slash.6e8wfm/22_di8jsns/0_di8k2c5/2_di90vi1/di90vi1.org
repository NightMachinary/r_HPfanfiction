Because I have yet to find a gay pairing that makes sense. I guess the closest one I can think of is Harry/Neville but I started disliking Neville because he's always the substitute friend for Harry and tends to be rather boringly written.

There are far more femslash pairings that are believable. Luna/Ginny or Luna/Hermione can be built on friendship. Hermione /Fleur can be fun if you either go with Fleur sees Hermione for the awesome person she is or by the kindred spirit approach where Fleur has few true friends and they simply get along once they start a conversation in private. Luna/Fleur can work in the same way. And there's always Tonks if you want someone cheery.

But let's take a look at the male side characters in Harry Potter.

There's Ron but for me the only good Weasley is Charlie and the twins to some extent. But I don't see either pairing working. Therefore the Weasleys are out.

We have a couple of relatively unimportant side characters that could maybe work with some good writing but I don't fancy playing smut roulette where 99/100 stories are just bad.

And then there are the Death Eaters. A bunch of racist scum that should be simply tossed through the veil, hanged or executed in an even more painful way. They started a magical SS. They should be purged without remorse because they showed none. A nice NÃ¼rnberg style trial before their imminent death. There isn't one of the lot that makes a believable parter for Harry and I'm not interested in reading stories with terrorists in any role but the opposition. I include both Draco and Snape in this category because I see them as bigoted idiots who supported a racist ideology. They are simply scum. I don't care about bullshitting exuses for them. Both were bigots before they joined.

There's Remus, who completely ignored Harry for most of his life. Who tried to run after he fathered a child. Who wallows in self pity. He's certainly not a suitable match.

There's Sirius but besides his questionable mental state he's better suited for a father role and not for a lover. I mean, Harry/Lily is a thing too, just not a plausible or well written thing.

Based on Rowling's work I can see the following pairings. Harry/Hermione, Harry/Luna, Harry/Fleur, Harry/Alicia, Angelina or Katie and Harry/Tonks. Everything else feels too OOC. Harry/Daphne is a thing this fandom loves but I've only read one good story with this pairing.
