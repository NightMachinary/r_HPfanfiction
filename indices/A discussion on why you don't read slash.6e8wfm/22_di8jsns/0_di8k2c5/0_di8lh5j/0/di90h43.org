I also don't read explicit het. I recced someone a 100+ chapter gen fic that met all the requirements of their request--only to have them come back and berate me a week later when they got to chapter 76 and it was revealed that one of the MCs had had an FWB thing going on with another male character /fifteen years before the story started/. Some people are really serious about their no slash.

I don't rec things to people anymore unless I know they're alright with slash.
