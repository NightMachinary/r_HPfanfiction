I've tried a few slash stories and still read the odd one here and there but it's definitely not my favourite. The first reason is that the pairings are almost always unbelievable. Harry/Draco for instance or Harry /Snape. Harry/Ron might make some sense but there ain't much of that.

The next thing is that in canon the main characters demonstrate absolutely nothing but hetero tendencies so you have to start from scratch to show their gay character develop - and as recently discussed in another thread, I'm not that interested in reading full redo fics.

But the main thing is that slash fics tend to be written as fantasies by people with no sexual experience, especially since it seems women write more slash and men more femslash (I'm quite happy to be proven wrong there - that's just my impression.) I prefer stories where the smut is realistic.
