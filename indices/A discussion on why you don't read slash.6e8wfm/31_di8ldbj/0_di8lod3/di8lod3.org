Interesting observation. I agree that gay smut is the most unrealistic thing Ive ever read. It's Honestly, hilarious.

I will say this, as a bisexual person. Sexuality for the LGBTQ community isn't always(or even often) so cut and dry. You don't have to build yourself up to being attracted to a person, sometimes you just are.

I had my first female crush when I was 14. Had never even looked at another girl that way. I sat down next to her in class is and had a total "woah" moment. Then I proceeded to freak the fuck out.

Just saying it's not as unrealistic as you might think for someone to spontaneous develop attraction.
