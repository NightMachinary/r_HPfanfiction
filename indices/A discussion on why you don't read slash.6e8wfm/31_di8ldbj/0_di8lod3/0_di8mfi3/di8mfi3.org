Fair point. I've had a couple of male crushes. One was an apparently obvious one on the captain of the school rugby team who ended up as Head Boy (please don't bother with the obvious jokes there). The other was just after I went to University with a guy who seemed incredibly world-wise and turned me on with his brain.

So I get that attractions can appear out of the blue, but that's also something that most slash simply skips over. When it happened to me I was aware enough to question my feelings : was it genuine or was it a substitute for a woman (mine was an all-boy school). Rarely happens in fics.

If there's a list of good slash or femslash then I'd be happy to read it.
