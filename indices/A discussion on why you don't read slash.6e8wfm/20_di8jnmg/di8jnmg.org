I am a heterosexual male. I have a close friend who is gay, and another close friend who was raised by 2 gay dads (and a close lesbian friend too). I have no problem with people being gay (or lesbian), but I also know that its not my thing and I have zero interest in reading about it, seeing movies about it, or to be honest... thinking excessively about it. As such, reading it is simply not interesting to me, and yes... at times... uncomfortable (sexual scenes mainly). I do like romance in the stories I read so that plays a big factor.

I would simply say that when I read, I liked to get sucked into the stories and at times put myself in the place of the main character. So because of my lack of interest on the subject, and the aspects mentioned before, I generally wont read slash focused fics. Note I mentioned slash FOCUSED. I don't have the same sort of aversion to fics where slash relationships do play a roll, just as long as the main character or main focus of the story is NOT slash.

And I think that's a key distinction in my case.

Edit: Id just like to add on that just like most heterosexual males, the idea of bisexual women or lesbians is definitely more intriguing than gay/bisexual men when it comes to reading (fantasy) material. I'm not going to pretend that its all that fair to look at things that way, but it is what it is. And if you are being sucked into the story or putting yourself in a main characters position, well... your views, feelings, and interests transfer.
