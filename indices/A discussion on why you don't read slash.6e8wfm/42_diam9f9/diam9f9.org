Ah, discussions like this tend to turn very ugly very quickly. But here is the crux of the matter, as someone who writes slash, reads slash, and mods a slash fic subreddit for Harry Potter. People are uncomfortable with homosexuality. The excuse of 'it makes me uncomfortable' is because homosexual relationships have not been normalized in society the way that heterosexual relationships have been. You look at every TV show, movie, book, comic, etc, and they are rife with romantic subplot and they are always hetero. It has been this way only until recently (like the last four-ish years) that homosexual relationships have really started being represented in mainstream media. People who are "uncomfortable" (Read: yes, this is a form of homophobia albeit not a malicious one...simply a result of a world that has not yet come to terms with homosexuality being an actual prominent 'thing') don't like seeing their supposed hetero favs being "turned gay".

The excuse of slash not being written realistically is just that, an excuse. There's about as much crappy slash as there is crappy het and I think what happens is it's easy to say that all slash is cliche and cringey mush and then avoid it like the plague as opposed to acknowledging that slash has some great fics and it has some shitty fics, just like any other genre does. Saying that all slash is written by virgin teens who have no idea how homosexual sex works is ridiculous because you will find the same to be true in the het side of things. I'd say a significant chunk of romance het fics are written by either A.) virgins or B.) virgin teens and are just as, if not more at times, unrealistic in their depictions of sex, romance, and relationships. Invalid argument is invalid. And also, this is fanFICTION about wizards so I'd say arguments about realism are pretty much null in this case.

I ship characters because I think their personalities compliment each other or the possibilities for a relationship together seems interesting. Yes, this does involve slash pairings for me (namely Drarry in the HP fandom) but it also involves a fair amount of het and femslash pairings. People are still too hung up on gender and sexuality as it applies to traditional gender roles and society. That is what the real problem here is.

And then of course there are just your run of the mill assholes who are homophobic and make no attempt at hiding it and think "gay sex is gross!!!!".
