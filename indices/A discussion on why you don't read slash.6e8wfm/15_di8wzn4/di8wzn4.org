I don't like slash much but won't hate it so much to avoid it at all costs.

The reason why I don't like it is that it's usually not well written. Instead of reasonable plot they make the whole story based on gayness, which just isn't that interesting. I also don't envision Harry as gay, so it ruins the immersion for me. I don't mind so much when it's a believable character, like Dumbledore.

I'mâ€‹ not a huge fan of romance anyway, as quite a few hetro stories do similar things where the whole story is about a girl, those are also shit.
