I don't actually care to read the graphic depictions of het sex either.

As far as slash pairings themselves, I can read them if they're not the main focus of the story. If the story involves two characters who do stuff and happen to be in a slash ship that's fine. I don't like reading twoo wuv in slash or het. I can also read if the pairing doesn't diverge from my head canon too much. I can buy Draco/Theo or Sirius/Remus, but I find Drarry to be entirely too implausible.
