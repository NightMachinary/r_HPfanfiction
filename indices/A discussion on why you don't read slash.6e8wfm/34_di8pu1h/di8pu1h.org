Oftentimes when I'm finding a new fic to read, I fall into a bad habit of only reading the summary and ignoring the tags. This has led to me reading a few slash fics which I found alright, but those never actually involved any slash at all and were abandoned before the story got to it. However, there are times when I'm enjoying the fic and out of nowhere Harry becomes pregnant with Voldemort's or Snape's kid after getting forced into having sex with them or after turning into an insatiable cum guzzling machine.

The kicker here is, those weren't actually tagged as a slash fic so I shudder to think what's ACTUALLY included in a real, finished slash fic.
