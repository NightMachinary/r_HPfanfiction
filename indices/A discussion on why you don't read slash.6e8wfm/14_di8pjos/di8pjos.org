To me it depends on what the core element of the fic is. As a heterosexual male, I have no interest in reading a fic (or book in general) where a significant portion of the plot is a gay love story. Likewise, gay sex scenes are a big no.

That said, if the main character happens to be gay or it doesn't dovert the plot too much I have no issue with it. Again and Again is a good example. I got into it because I was interested in Harry and the premise of the fic.

I read the first few sex scenes and Harry's romance with Voldemort because the fic had other things going for me (until it didn't and just became a romance fic so I dropped it).

This extends to non-slash fics too. I generally don't like it when a non-romance fic devotes a huge portion of its pacing/scenes to romance. For example, I thoroughly enjoyed The Lie I've Lived, because the romance is integrated to the point where it doesn't feel like it's taking away from the story.

That was a super long winded way to say (1) I don't like romance in non-romance-fics and (2) I only like reading straight romance fics. If a fic that I'm super into involved gay romance but it didn't detract from the story (like if say Harry and Blaise became a thing in Prince of Slytherin and it was handeled well) I wouldn't have a problem.
