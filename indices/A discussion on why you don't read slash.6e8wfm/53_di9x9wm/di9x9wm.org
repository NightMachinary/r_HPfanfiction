I've read a few fics with slash pairings in the background and I have to admit it always turns me off a little bit, kind of a visceral reaction even though intellectually I have no problem with it. So yeah I just don't seek them out intentionally.

Also those stories often feature teenage sexual identity angst, and while that is probably great for young teenagers getting in touch with their queerness it does absolutely nothing for me and I find it annoying.
