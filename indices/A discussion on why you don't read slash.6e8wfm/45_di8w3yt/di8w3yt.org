As a rule I don't read fics that focus only on romance. This is most prevalent in the slash fic community, I'm sorry to say. There are a few slash fictions I enjoy like Midnight Sun by Herald-MageAnuli along with it's sequel Darkest Before Dawn, mainly due to the romance having been worked into the superb plot.

Also, I happen to be into sprawling epics and long series of extended stories. Unfinished slash fics from the 00's abandoned by they're maturing, usually female writers turn me off slash immensely.

My gender and sexuality have nothing to do with it. I am a lesbian trans woman. I lived in the wonderfully gay streets of San Francisco for 5 years before returning to grey old Blighty. During those 5 years I saw all manner of homosexual interaction. I walked in on a friend and his boyfriend and couldn't care less. My reasons are based on the general quality slash writings.
