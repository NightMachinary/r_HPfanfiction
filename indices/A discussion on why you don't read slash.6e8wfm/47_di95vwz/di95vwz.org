So when I first started reading fanfiction as a 14-15 yr old sexually confused het guy any pairing I read was for the purpose of 'turning me on' so I never went looking for slash pairings at all... My only exposure was the really obviously badly written drarry and severitus... However given the amount of ff I've read I inevitably came upon slash fics that didn't immediately come out and say it...I remember distinctly a very graphic one that was a hp/ Stargate Atlantis cross over. The story was good enough that I kept reading... But I still avoided slash in general because I never saw any good pairings(the only ones I ever considered were crossover characters. Every other male hp character is not very compelling)... But with more exposure I slowly became acclimated to slash stories... One big example I can think of is the show sense8... The character lito gets up to some pretty graphic stuff and though it isn't a plus to me, it's not a negative either... Then I got a girlfriend who is really into slash though not in the hp genre... After that I read some of her slash to edit it, and even dabbled in writing some for her curiosity. Now when I come across a hidden slash story I don't immediately dismiss it. But I also don't go actively looking either mainly because I'm lazy and going to look for the good stuff is time consuming.

On an aside, I really don't like drarry fics. And it doesn't have anything to do slash...I read a femharry/Draco fic and though it was realistic given Canon Harry and Draco, it had all the makings of a slightly abusive relationship, which is the only way I can see it working other than a complete ooc Harry. The only way I see that pairing working without drastic altering Harry or Draco's upbringing is to have some extremely traumatic event happen to Draco...I remember a fic (not slash) where Harry and Draco become friends because Draco is killed by Voldemort and becomes a ghost... And eventually possessed an alternate reality version of him. Something like that I can see causing a friendship or relationship to form.

So Tldr; I'm became ok with slash in fics but the lack of compelling HP male characters combined with my laziness means I don't usually read them.
