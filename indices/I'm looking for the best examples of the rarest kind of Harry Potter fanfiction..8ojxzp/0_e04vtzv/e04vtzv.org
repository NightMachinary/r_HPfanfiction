No one has answered you yet, so here's some suggestions. They mostly fit your stipulations, from what I recall.

linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) - pacing turned me off personally, but a lot of people recommend it due to the world building.

linkffn(Definitions of Romance) - Honestly, probably the best romance I've seen. It's surprisingly natural and in-character, and therefore believable. Sadly a one-shot, but it's really how H/Hr should be written. Almost nothing else like it for any pairing since Harry and Hermione have the most defined characterization in canon; this nails everything.

linkffn(Hermione Granger is Stupid) - Similar to Definitions of Romance, just a notch below since the impetus for the relationship is a bit too heavy-handed to seem quite natural. But it does well nearly everywhere else (Ron and Hermione have to actually grow as characters due to fucking up being good friends to Harry.

linkffn(Reclamation of Black Magic) - Ok, this has some slash and there's a teensy bit of overbashing Dumbledore later, but the slash is easy to skip (happens once or twice). But the writing, characterization and build up are excellent. Cassiopeia steals the show, honestly.

linkffn(Limpieza de Sangre) - last few chapters/ending are a bit of a letdown (though there's a sequel now). Overall, worth a read for the take on Voldemort and her motives and such (fem!Voldemort, as a heads-up).
