  Harry, after much consideration after the Triwizard Tournament, decides that he needs to make a change in order to survive Voldemort.Blaise Zabini, haunted by something in his past and confronted with it again in the present, he is bound and determined to right a wrong, an injustice no one seems to care about.The two, paired together by professors who see great potential beyond the boy's imagination, may bring about change to the wizarding world that changes the tides of the war, and brighten the future of humanity.
