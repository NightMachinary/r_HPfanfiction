1. Don't just read fanfic. Yes, fanfic can be great and give you ideas, but it'll make you forget that "magical cores" is not actually a thing in canon.

2. Don't fail to read any fanfic. If you have an idea, go looking to see if someone else has done it before. The key to an original take isn't just an original idea, but you should be aware of what's out there.

3. Reread canon (even just a scene here and there) and try your damndest to get the character voices right. This is such a huge pet peeve of mine. Go beyond having Snape throw around "dunderheads." Try to hear what they sound like in your head when you read them, and work from there.

4. Invent what you need, use what you want, but "it's cool" is a bad reason to have, for example, Harry get a pet snake or be an animagus or invent a whole new form of magic. If all you want to do is world build and tetris new abilities and modes onto canon that's fine, but most readers are looking for a plot first. Focus on the plot. Everything should be there for a reason. This isn't a history text, it's fiction. We don't need every detail, we just need the relevant ones to the story you're trying to tell here. If Harry needs this new form of magic, that's fine, but we probably don't actually need to know everything about how it works, how he developed it, and so on. You should know those details so you can use them, but the reader doesn't need them.

5. If you're bored writing it, your reader is going to be bored reading it. Skip ahead; summarize; don't dwell in a boring training montage if it's just a boring training montage. Just skip ahead to them being trained, or a much later part of the training where they demonstrate new skill and new challenges. Sometimes this means it makes the most sense to skip entire /years./ This can seem terrifying and impossible and irresponsible. It isn't! Even if important things happen in those years, you can recap. Keep your writing snappy, active, always moving forward towards /something/--it doesn't have to be the main plot goal but it does have to keep moving. Stagnation is the death of interest.

6. Whenever possible, world-build or expose backstory in dialog or in scene rather than in narration. This isn't always possible but when it is, it is so much better. And keep that character voice during the exposition! The way Remus talks about the first war isn't going to be the way Sirius talks about the first war isn't going to be the way Albus talks about the first war.
