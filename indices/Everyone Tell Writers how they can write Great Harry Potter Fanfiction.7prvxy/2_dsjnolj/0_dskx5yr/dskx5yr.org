I disagree with half of 4. I /love/ that sort of worldbuilding (inventing new magic, etc.), even for its own sake, be it in fanfiction or original fiction. Of course, there should /also/ be a storyline, but I'm fine with unnecessary worldbuilding details if they're creative. On the other hand, I agree with the first part, the "don't add something just because IT'S COOL and then never use it for anything" with the "pet snake" example. Either make the pet snake an actual character, or skip him; I'd argue that precisely by the same token, if Harry is inventing new magic, then by god, /tell us about this new magic/, rather than just handwave that "he worked long and hard and perfected it" and then only have him throw around previously-unmentioned new spells just because the plot demands it.
