You tell a very step wise writing process. I'll offer my way of writing as a sort of other view on this.

My stories start with a cool idea. My last story, for example, started with "what if Harry and Ginny go on a roadtrip together and are chased by evil guys with guns." The sequel to it that I'm writing now started with "I want to write a Stephen King story". And then comes the brainstorming phase where I draft as many plot points, story lines, themes and individual scenes/shots as I can. Somewhere in that process I start writing the actual story, and after that it's a balancing game between working out the planned out sketches and improvisation while writing.

I do pre-plan stuff like major characters, the ending and POV. But other than that it's not really as formulaic as you described. And that's completely fine. Everyone has their own preferred way of writing. The challenge is simply to write and write and write so that you get to know yourself as an author. Know your strengths, things you can improve, etc. You'll never achieve perfection, but I think the process of becoming a better author and getting to know yourself in the process, that's more than worth the time and effort.
