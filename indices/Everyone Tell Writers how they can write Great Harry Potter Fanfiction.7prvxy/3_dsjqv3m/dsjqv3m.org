Writing is communication. As such, you need to decide before you start what it is you wish to communicate. "I think Harry Potter is awesome" is a starting point, but dig deeper. What story do you want to tell? A love story? A coming of age tale? Who will be the players in this story, and what are their roles? People on this reddit like to complain about bashing, but really, a well done character bash isn't bad, and in fact can be fascinating. The key though is to know WHY you are doing this, and what the bash seeks to communicate. A bash of Ginny's character that showed how damaging building up your idols to be godlike then having to realize their very human faults would be excellent.

Speaking of what you wish to communicate, your story needs a theme and a moral. No, I don't mean something trite like your theme being Christmas or your moral being "follow your heart." I mean what message is running through the heart of your story and what are you communicating to the reader? For example, a story about Harry in Slytherin could have a theme of the importance of having ambition and drive, with the moral at the end being that if you work hard and are willing to do what it takes, you can achieve anything. A romance story between Harry and Lavender Brown could be communicating that sometimes, it's OK just to have fun and not take life so seriously with the moral being happiness can be found anywhere with the right people. Note that your story WILL have a theme and a moral, but if you are not intentional about it your theme and moral could be really off putting and even go against what you thought they were.

Once you have chosen what your theme is and what you are communicating, choose what characters will help you best communicate this. Yes, you can start with saying "I want to ship A and B together" but at that point you're not so much writing a story as simply writing pornography. This is also when you should think about SI's and OC's. There really are plots and themes that are better addressed with less familiar characters who have fewer preconceived notions surrounding them. Keep in mind that stories live and die on their characters. If your audience can't empathize with your charaters no matter how interesting your plot or important your moral, your story will fall flat. Conversely, you can get a way with a lot of plot holes and a dumb theme if your characters are compelling enough.

Be familiar with the Seven Basic Plots: Metamorphosis, Tragedy, Comedy, The Quest, The Journey, and The Monster. Decide what plot you want your story to follow in a grand, overarching way. Keep in mind that this is just a framework: you need to know your start, midpoint, and end point, but you can fill in the rest of the details along the way. You don't even really have to follow a three act structure, but I recommend it as a three act structure is easiest to read and to write.

Choose how your story will be told. First person? Third Person? Or, if you are brave and daring, second person? Will it be told as a standard literary account? Is there some sort of conceit, like this is a journal or letters or a biography or a story told to a child? Keep in mind what that medium will do for you. First person limits what the writer can know or experience. Third person allows a more omniscient perspective. Letters are written with the intent to convey something to a specific person or group. A journal is about self reflection and recording events and feelings of the author.

Finally, canon and fanon have their place, and sometimes it's on the cutting room floor. Slavish adherence to what has come before is no way to tell a new and exciting story. Want to tell a story where students are sorted in third year? Fine, as long as it fits your theme, plot, and characters. You can write a good story out of the dumbest ideas as long as your execution comes together well. You want to write victorian romance with Lord Potter-Black-Slytherin? You can do it if you have a strong plot and characters.

Oh, one more thing. Know your audience. If you are after fame and acclaim, keep in mind that certain things are going to get peoples attention more. Yet Another Time Travel Power Wank is going to get more attention than a story about Remus Lupins inner struggle with being a werewolf. Dramonie Smut Fest No. 45742 is going to be more popular than a lighthearted Harry/Ginny adventure tale. But no matter what, have fun. You certainly are not getting paid for this.
