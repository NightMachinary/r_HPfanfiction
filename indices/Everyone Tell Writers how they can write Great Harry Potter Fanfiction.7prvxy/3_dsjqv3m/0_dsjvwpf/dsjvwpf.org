Lots of good points. I forget where i saw this first, but i would say the 5 act structure has a better flow, is better defined and is more natural than the 3 act structure.

If you can handle the "ALL CAPS" or just copy/paste/edit it to lowercase, this is an entertaining read explaining why the 3 act structure really isn't a thing, and the 5 act structure is more accurate.
