  it is slowing down in terms of popular, high quality content when compared to earlier years (such as 2012).

I have only been writing fanfiction since 2014 and I am already very old, but I'm not convinced about that statement at all. I expect there are less stories being posted as the original fan base moves on and frankly the new batch of material (the FB films and the /Play/) don't seem to lend themselves to the same level of engagement, but I don't see any decline in quality in fanfiction. I wonder if the people who say this have been reading fanfiction for a long time, and it's not the fanfiction that has changed, but their own tastes. They recognise poor writing when they see it now, where they wouldn't have done a few years ago.

I've certainly looked at a lot of earlier stories and while it seems reviews were more plentiful than they are now, an awful lot of the stories are very badly written. I even see stories recommended on here that have spelling and grammatical errors and dreadful prose in the first paragraphs, yet people still like them. And unfinished stories too. (How can you know if a plot is any good until the end?) So truthfully, as long as the writing has a reasonable level of legibility, quality has not much to do with popularity; and for a lot of readers, plot is secondary to simply reading about their favourite characters doing the same things over and over again. In fact I think those fanfiction writers who do work at constructing coherent and interesting plots are likely using fanfiction as practice for moving on to original writing.
