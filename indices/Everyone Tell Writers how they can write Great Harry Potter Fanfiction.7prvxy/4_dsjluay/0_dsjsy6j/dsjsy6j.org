Wholeheartedly agree with this. I went through 50k words I've never published before releasing my first story, which was a 2.5k words long oneshot. After publishing 50k words and writing another 50k that will never see the light I went back to my first story and, while satisfied with the plot, the technical side sucked so I reworked it.

And I've read a lot of fanfic over that time, easily 10 million words, over which my tastes changed a lot. My first ever story idea was a Harry/Luna soulbound while I'm nowadays writing a dark mystery story with some Harry/Tonks fluff and international intrigues. I used to like marriage contracts/laws before realising that it was basically rape. I used to like Remus before starting to see him as a shitty man.

Some things stayed the same though. I always hated Snape/Draco/any Death Eater and can't stand them in a good light. I still don't like slash. I still do not understand why the Weasleys are well liked, I absolutely despise the canon pairings and I still think that the Epilogue is a pile of shit.

Overall I agree with your statement, experience is key.
