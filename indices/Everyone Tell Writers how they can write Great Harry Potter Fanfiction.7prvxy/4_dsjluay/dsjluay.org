To write great Harry Potter (or any other kind of) fiction, first you must write a lot of bad Harry Potter fiction.

It's like drawing, or any other skill. You need to work at it.

Other advice: read a lot: You'll need to develop your taste if you want to make good stuff. Write outside your norms. Get into conversations about writing. Read books on how to write. Learn grammar. Seek feedback, but learn how to parse feedback into useful hints. Learn from other media. Learn form other fandoms.

But the most important thing is to write.
