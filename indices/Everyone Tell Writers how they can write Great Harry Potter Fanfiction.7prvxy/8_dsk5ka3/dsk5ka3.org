*Keep it simple. I've seen a ton of stories trying to get too fancy, and they end up writing themselves into a knot.

*Don't just rehash the same thing that's been done a million times. Don't fall into the trap of "cliches done right", since that's often times just worse.

*A story needs a reason to exist - what is the story that you're trying to tell?

*Don't pander to reviewers. The most important critic is yourself.

*Don't be afraid to derail from the stations of canon. There's no point of an OP Harry "Black" in Slytherin if he's just going to make all the same Gryffindor friends and hitting all the same plot points.
