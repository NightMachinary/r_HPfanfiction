For the love of God, type your fanfic into Word, or the Open Office equivalent, and check for squiggly lines underneath. Those indicate misspellings, words that aren't used properly, poor grammar, and poor sentence structure.

Fully 50% of bad fanfic would rise to mediocre or better if the writer had a reasonable command of English grammar. I'm not even britpicking.

Finally, PROOFREAD. “Lucious” is a name. It is, however, not Draco's father's name. Make sure you are saying what you think you are.
