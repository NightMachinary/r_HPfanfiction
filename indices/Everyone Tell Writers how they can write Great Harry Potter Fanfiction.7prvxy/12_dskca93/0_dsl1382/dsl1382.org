I concur. I mean, why bother writing fanfiction at all when you simply write Rowling's story with minor changes? I'm writing a couple stories and I always wonder why people rehash canon. Writing takes time so why would anyone waste time writing that? A creative plot is not difficult to come up with, or even a DIFFERENT take on existing plots.
