Leave Hogwarts behind. Its a trap. There is a whole world out there and this readership has read far too many 'canon done right' fics. Hogwarts is formulaic and easy its comfortable ground but its been done. There are three quarters of a million Harry Potter fanfictions. Too many of those slave themselves to a building, to events, to certain characters, Hogwarts is canon, out of hogwarts is freedom. Canon is often a dammed if you do, dammed if you don't situation. Leaving it behind but staying in the world allows for so much more potential. You can write your own stories within the HP universe without needing to talk about Astronomy class for the 56th time.

The readership has grown up. Those that started the books as kids are now adults. Don't be scared to move your universe with you, you can write best about what you know. If its been a long time since you interacted with children you might be way off trying to write them. There is so much scope for grown-ups in the Harry Potter world, so much exploring to do but Hogwarts is safe and Hogwarts is easy and therefore Hogwarts is stifling.
