Not who you were responding to, but we know Arthur Weasley writes laws, including loopholes, about magical misuse of muggle artefacts. This is mentioned in CoS by Molly before the degnoming of the garden in the Burrow. It's strongly indicated that Crouch sr, as the Head of the Auror department at the time, wrote a law that put all or some suspected Death Eaters in Azkaban without a trial after the first war ended. This can be derived from Sirius's talk in the cave in GoF. Likely all departments at the ministry write laws concerning things they are responsible for.
