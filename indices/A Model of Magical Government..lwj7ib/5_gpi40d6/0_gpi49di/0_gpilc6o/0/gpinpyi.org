Hmm, that's certainly true. Although, it might not only mean what you said. Using the framework I created, it is the responsibility of the Minister, and by extension the departments they create, to achieve what the Wizengamot wants. If there is a need that arises unexpectedly it would make sense for the departments to deal with it internally so long as it does not step outside the limits of their stated Wizengamot directive. In this way it would be possible for the various departments and offices to write '"laws" relating to their specific subject matter. So long as these policies did not conflict with the larger departmental directive, then the policies would be upheld.

It's a bit like a judicial review, the laws of the Wizengamot have primacy over the policies instituted by the offices and departments of the ministry, and when the two come into conflict the laws of the Wizengamot win.
