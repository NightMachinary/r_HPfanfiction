Personally I go with my headcanon that Wizengamot membership is obtained through internal nomination and election. So the seats aren't technically hereditary, but old pureblood families have a sort of unspoken agreement that when their heir is nominated for a seat, they'll all vote in favor of their inclusion. This gives it a thin veneer of democracy because anyone can technically get in, but the purebloods have made it into a self-perpetuating system where their families are all assured seats. This also makes having connections all the more important because the only way to get in the Wizengamot is to know the people in it.
