I still find some flaws with your argument, and they stem from this sentence.

#+begin_quote
  If the legislative and the judiciary are the same body, that body does not protect the liberty of the people it alleges to represent.

You make two critical assumptions in this, 1. That the government was created to represent the people, and 2. That the government is designed to protect liberty.

We have to keep in mind that wizarding society is not very socially advanced, and that they don't really need a whole lot of support on an individual level to survive, which then leads to slow advancement in social change. Wizarding Britain diverged from muggle britain in 1692 with the statute of secrecy, and despite many trappings of modernization it seems like their government is still very much a contemporary of that time.

Back then things like liberty and representation weren't the primary objectives of government, the primary objectives were security and stability. We see the government of Magical Britain upholding security with the statute, and given how much Fudge freaks out over even the possibility of "You Know Who" being back, saying it will incite panic, it seems that stability is another key element.

The things that we would look for in a modern society just aren't things that most of Wizarding Britain values.
