All of my arguements are based on the assumption that the government of Magical Britain operates in the manner I described above. This means that I am assuming that the Wizengamot is indeed both legislature /and/ judiciary. This also includes the distinctions between the people who work at the ministry and those that represent it. I am not using the "canon" system as the basis for ny arguements because there isn't enough present to base anything on, and frankly what is present is a hot mess. What I have created here is an attempt at extrapolating a logical framework of government based on what we know of canon, without directly adhering to its every detail, or more critically, lack of detail. It isn't fair to say that the Wizengamot is /only/ a legal court just because we don't see them acting out legislative duties. The only other people we see doing this are Arthur Weasley and Barty Crouch, and I have reaponded to that idea elsewhere. The fact remains that the Wizengamot is the /most likely/ optipn for a legislative body, even if it is never explicitly stated to be such.
