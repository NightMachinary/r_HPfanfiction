Ah but we only ever see the Wizengamot /enforce/ the law. The Minister aside, we don't know who /creates/ the law. And we don't know how those people, the minister included, are chosen. I think the Wizengamot is more like the judiciary, Arthur even referred to it as a court. A parliament is not a court, in any democracy they must be separated.

It always seemed to me that the Minister wasn't a Minister in the parliamentary sense, he was more like a senior civil servant. If you progress through the ministry, as a worker, you can eventually become Minister. There's no differentiation between people who work at the ministry and people who represent it. That's always been my issue.

  If the Wizengamot is accessible to all people then it is a representative democracy

Yes and no. If the Wizengamot is the parliament equivalent, and I'm not sure it is but let's go with that for the sake of what you're saying, it's only representative democracy if any magical adult is able to be /elected/ to it. If any magical adult is able to be /co-opted/ to it, it's not a democracy, even if it is representative!
