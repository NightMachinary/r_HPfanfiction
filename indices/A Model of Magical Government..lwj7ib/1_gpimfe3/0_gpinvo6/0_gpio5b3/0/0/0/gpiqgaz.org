In that case, the status of Magical Britain's government being a dictatorship hinges on the method by which members are admitted to the Wizengamot. In the system I have described, the offices of the Chief Warlock and Minister of Magic are limited to only those powers that they are expressly given by the Wizengamot, which is very few for the chief warlock, and what amounts to "achieve our directives by any means necessary" for the Minister. If the Wizengamot is accessible to all people then it is a democracy, if it is hereditary then it is essentially an aristocracy mixed with an oligarchy.
