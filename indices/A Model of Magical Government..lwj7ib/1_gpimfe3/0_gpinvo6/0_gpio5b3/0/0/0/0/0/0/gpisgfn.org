Yep. Which brings me back to my original point, that even in your incredibly logical and well thought out interpretation, the things we would see as basic cornerstones of not just democracy but functioning government are missing.

If the legislative and the judiciary are the same body, that body does not protect the liberty of the people it alleges to represent.

The system Rowling created, potentially even by accident, is really really broken if you follow her implications, as you have done, to their logical conclusion. And the wizarding population just accept this, despite being heavily armed to a man!

I'm really glad you did this post. Not just because it's really well done, but because it inherently proves just how much wizarding Britain actually sucks once you get past the "wow" factor of magic and the fact that it looks quaint and old. It's hiding a really dark heart behind all that tweeness.
