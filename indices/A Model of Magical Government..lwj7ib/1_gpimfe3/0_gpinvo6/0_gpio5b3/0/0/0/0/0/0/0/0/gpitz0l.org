Yes, I see all that. I even made that point in my first reply- much like the older forms of Government in the Muggle world, it seems wizarding society sees democracy as something of an irrelevance.

My point is that the implications are terrifying. And Rowling touches on it, on numerous occasions, and then just lets it go. The later books could have been much more of a dystopia if she'd followed that thread a bit.

  We have to keep in mind that wizarding society is not very socially advanced, and that they don't really need a whole lot of support on an individual level to survive, which then leads to slow advancement in social change.

Agree, but again I don't think the canon works show it properly. They have an old fashioned economic system, they have an autocratic government, they don't seem to understand basic things like separation of powers; yet they have state education and healthcare, which absolutely doesn't fit in with the contemporary of the 1690s argument, as state education came 200 years later in Muggle Britain, and state healthcare 250. So they have some really quite modern and advanced ideas, yet they have some absolutely broken ones in other ways.

I guess I just feel like a society that had advanced socially to the point where it understands children must be educated and people should get free healthcare should also understand that communities should vote for their leaders.

A book based around "get rid of the evil man who wants to enslave us all and be a bad dictator" shouldn't then default to the status quo of benign dictatorship, I mean is the logical conclusion of what we are both saying ultimately that Rowling's world has the message that it's fine if people are denied their rights as long as the person doing the denying isn't a racist mass murderer and throws them a bone occasionally?! The inherent corruption and obsession with security over liberty is exactly the conditions that allowed Voldemort to rise, twice. By dealing with the symptom not the cause, I feel like the books didn't deal with the deeper message she hints at occasionally.
