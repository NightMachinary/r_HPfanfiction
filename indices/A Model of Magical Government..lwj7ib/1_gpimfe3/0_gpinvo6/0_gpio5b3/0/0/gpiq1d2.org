Oh I agree with you, I do think the whole point is its corrupt and outdated. It just surprises me, knowing what I know about her political activity, that she didn't sort of go more strongly either way, if you get me? It's /implied/ that it's a dictatorship, or a benign autocracy, but she doesn't make a major point out of it even in the later books. If anything, there's an impicaton that Voldemort is going to take over and be a dictator yet there's no acknowledgement that the MoM is nothing more than a dictator!!

  Yeah the people vote for which member of parliament gets the job, but it's always a member of parliament.

Well, we don't vote directly on who's PM. We vote for our own individual constituency MPs and the party with the most seats is invited to form a government. Obviously it amounts to the same thing though as we know at the time of the election who the party leaders, and thus the defacto nominees, are. Interestingly enough, convention states that the leader of that party takes on the role, but constitutionally there's actually nothing that says the PM must be an MP. Until the early 20th century it was quite common for the PM to be a member of the House of Lords. I wonder what would actually happen if it was challenged, and for example the parliamentary leader of the largest party said "I don't want the job. I'll represent the PM in the Commons, but I want to nominate [random member of the public] to actually be PM." I don't think there's anything explicitly forbidding that, but I also can't see any major party voting it through even if it's what their current leader wanted. It would be an interesting experiment though.
