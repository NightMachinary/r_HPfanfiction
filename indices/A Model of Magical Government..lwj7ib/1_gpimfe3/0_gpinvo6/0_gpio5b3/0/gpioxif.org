While I would agree with you if the intent was to imply a society with democratic process, I'm not sure that's what JK wanted. There is a pretty heavy theme of corruption and barbarity in the way the books depict the government of Magical Britain. The low-level workers like the weasleys are innocent of the corruption, but at the same time that corruption keeps them firmly where they are, out of the way. I honestly think that JK intended to create a society with a thoroughly flawed and outdated system, including not having a say in who was in charge. It's also worth noting that the British system of government also elects its prime minister from within its own legislature. Yeah the people vote for which member of parliament gets the job, but it's always a member of parliament. The Magical british system would be like that, just one step behind in evolution.
