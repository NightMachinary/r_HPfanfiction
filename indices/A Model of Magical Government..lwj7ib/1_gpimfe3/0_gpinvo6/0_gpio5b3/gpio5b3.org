I think if you're an active member of a political party, as she was, you should understand that universal voting is a thing at the very least. Sure, it's not a reason to expect her to understand the inner workings of government, but you'd think if she cared enough to join a party, she might have put a line in Book Six when Fudge goes about the election. Maybe even Ron saying to Harry "mum and dad voted for Scridgemour. Dad says he's a bit traditional, but he at least seems to believe you know who is back." Harry wouldn't have to have had an opinion on that, totally in character that unless he's shooting his magic gun or playing his magic sport he doesn't care. So it could literally have been that throwaway!
