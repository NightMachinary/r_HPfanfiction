So, basically what you're saying is that to British wizards, Montesquieu's declaration of the separation of powers, and indeed fair universal elections with a secret ballot, were just things that happened to other people?

Yep, that checks out. I think it actually fits with the insular presentation of the wizarding world. Much like how in post Roman Britain up to the end of the Georgian period people rejected democracy in part because it was "old fashioned", I can see wizards rejecting it because it's a "Muggle idea." Everyone in the government seems appointed, not elected, and wizards don't seem to question that. There doesn't seem to be any concept that politicans owe something to the electorate. That if you're in charge of a government, your role /should/ be to make the country better for the citizens. Wizarding Britain is basically a dictatorship, everyone thinks Fudge is a tool but there's never any move to get him voted out. Therefore we must assume that to vote him out is not an option for the public.

As I've said before on this sub, though, it really surprises me. JKR is quite political, at the time she was writing the books she was a member of a UK political party. I'd have thought she'd have thought about a few of the things she's insinuating through her books.
