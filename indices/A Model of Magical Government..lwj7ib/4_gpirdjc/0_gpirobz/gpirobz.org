I would argue that what you described is not canon on the grounds of none of those things ever being explicitly stated. We are shown the Wizengamot acting as a court, but we are never told that that is all it is. The Canon government is barely shown and full of holes, there isn't enough there to really make any decisive statements as to what the canon government is or isn't. That's why I made this, it's an extrapolation of canon information that attempts to make sense of as many disparate elements as possible.
