I disagree with you because I have a full breakdown of the legal system /as it is shown in the books/ on my side. I downvoted you because it seemed like you didn't read anything I wrote in my response and just kept on going with your opinion without looking at my response. And as for the Wizengamot not being shown passing laws, why would they? In what context would Harry, the pov character, be in a legislative session in any capacity? There are all kinds of things that aren't explicitly shown in the books but are implied to exist, it's a part of fiction that not everything is shown.
