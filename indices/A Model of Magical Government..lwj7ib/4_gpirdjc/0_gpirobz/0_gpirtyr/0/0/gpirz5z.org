#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter has three canonical trials and many other references to legal processes and systems which are never really explained in their totality. The few glimpses we do see are puzzling: why is Harry being tried before the full WIzengamot? Why does Fudge have such a huge role? What about Umbridge, and how does it all work? It's easy to say that JKR just didn't think of a cohesive legal system (and that may very well be correct), but what happens if we do an analysis of the legal processes shown in Harry Potter?Or: A lawyer takes on Harry Potter, and discovers that all witches and wizards are noble. Actually.
