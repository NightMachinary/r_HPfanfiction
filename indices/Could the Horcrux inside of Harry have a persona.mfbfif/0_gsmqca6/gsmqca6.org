I always thought that Harry was such a favorite target of Dementors was because he had a soul and some extra while Voldemort could easily deal with them without casting a Patronus because they were not interested in crumbs. Whether with the kiss would have come Harry's soul and Voldemort's piece of soul is unknown but I like to assume that not necessarily, solely based on Dumbledore's comment "in essence divided". However a greedy Dementor would have not only stopped at a piece of it but would have drained the whole thing.
