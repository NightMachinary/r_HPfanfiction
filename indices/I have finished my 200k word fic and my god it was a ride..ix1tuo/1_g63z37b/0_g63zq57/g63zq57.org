Oh my... such a quick response. Thank you. I honestly hate those first chapters after finishing the rest of the fic. They were written so long ago that the skill in later chapters makes the early ones pale in comparison. I fully intend to rewrite them at some point to bring them up to par with the rest of the fic.

I appreciate the interest!
