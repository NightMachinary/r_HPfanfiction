Not sure if you're interested, but I really liked Snape in [[http://www.intertexius.com/_index-harry-potter-fanfiction-and-art.html][A Bittersweet Potion]] and it's sequels. I consider it to be abandoned(though the authors keep saying they're still working on it), but the completed stories are still worth a read. It's Harry/Snape.

If you're okay with some more Snarry, I can dig through my bookmarks. There's one really good, long fic I'm thinking of but can't remember the name right now.
