Harry inherits all of the four houses of Hogwarts in addition to the Peverells and the Blacks. Unfortunately, all of the houses/families have enormous debts that Harry is unable to pay off and he dies alone in a gutter in Knockturn Alley when a Squib knifes him after he sold his wand in a last-ditch attempt to pay off the debt (it didn't work).
