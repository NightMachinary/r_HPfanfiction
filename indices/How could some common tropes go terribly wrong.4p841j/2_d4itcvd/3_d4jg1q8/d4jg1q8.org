It's abandoned but this is one of my favorite soul bond stories. Harry and Hermione are soul bond and.... everyone is distraught for them. You see, 99% of soul bonds ruin friendships, sometimes driving them to try to kill each other or themselves. Almost no person can stay sane while merging two minds together.
