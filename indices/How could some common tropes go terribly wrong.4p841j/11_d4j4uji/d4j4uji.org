Hermione Granger is sorted into Slytherin, for some odd reason, and instantly goes to tell the pure-blood bullies off, for being dicks! She walks straight up to Draco Malfoy, uncaring if she's going to royally piss off Draco.

At first the two get a long, especially when Hermione drops some juicy facts about Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Draco listened, waiting for information on the boy who dared turn down a Malfoy. His father, Lucius, said that no one refuses a Malfoy. He swiftly asks the girls name, as she was useful.

Hermione foolishly explains that she's a Muggle-born. She watches as Draco walks away, his parting words saying he'd be right back. She smiled when he returns. That is, of course, until she noticed the group of angry looking fifth-years behind him. She hears a word that she has never heard before and she realised it was a slur against her blood. The angry looking group got more riled up and started advancing on her.

The last thing she heard and saw was the group lifting their wands, a mixture of various profanity spewing out of their lips.

The Mudblood, Hermione Granger, never stood a chance in Slytherin and she was never seen again.
