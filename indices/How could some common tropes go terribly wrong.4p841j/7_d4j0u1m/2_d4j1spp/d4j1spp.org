Ugh, your comments on time travel stories are depressingly true. Everyone likes to recommend redo fics where Harry&Co are overwhelmingly powerful and steamroll past all canon obstacles. /And don't tell Dumbledore you're a time-traveler/ because /"reasons"./ Where's the adventure/mystery/unpreparedness/friendship/DeusExMagic that characterizes canon?
