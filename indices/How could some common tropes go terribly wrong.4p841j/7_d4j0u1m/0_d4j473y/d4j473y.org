  The "I'm smarter than J.K and can game a fantasy magic system. I'll have Harry *Fidelius* himself!" Right. You can cast the Fidelius on yourself? I've seen this trope in way too many fics, and I can't help but wonder - are all these authors so stupid? Spend 5 seconds thinking about a Voldemort hidden under a personal Fidelius. That's worst case scenario right there.

That's not the worst case. The worst case is literally no-one being able to see, hear or otherwise interact with Harry because if he's his own Secret Keeper then who the hell else knows the secret? I'd love that plot actually, just a one-shot of Harry slowly going mad from the inattention.
