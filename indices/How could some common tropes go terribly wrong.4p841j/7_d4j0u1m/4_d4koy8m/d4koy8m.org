  The "I'm smarter than J.K and can game a fantasy magic system. I'll have Harry Fidelius himself!" Right. You can cast the Fidelius on yourself? I've seen this trope in way too many fics, and I can't help but wonder - are all these authors so stupid? Spend 5 seconds thinking about a Voldemort hidden under a personal Fidelius. That's worst case scenario right there.

That's because people don't get what Fidelius actually is. It isn't a “hiding” charm or anything but rather a “loyalty” charm (note the similarity to the word “fidelity”, meaning “faithfulness” and created from the same Latin word than the charm's name. As such, it is not a charm that hides but instead a charm that protects something beneath a barrier of loyalty, with the caveat that you need to trust the secret keeper and they have to be loyal towards you (and presumably you towards them too). This is why the house in Godric's Hollow was in plain sight (the spell's hold simply slipped and it stopped being hidden, if it ever was) and why you'd need a really weird character for them to be capable of hiding themselves via Fidelius (if you are willing to hide yourself from sight completely, it implies that you do not trust anyone to protect you normally, and thus you do not really trust anyone, and thus the spell won't take hold no matter whom you choose to be your secret keeper). Likewise, this is why Tom would never be able to use the spell anyway, although I don't expect those who don't get how it works to notice that.

  Magical cores, and more specifically, the measuring of these cores, is just asking for a Caste system. It's pretty much the only logical outcome. Would a system where only the powerful ruled be bad? I mean, you'd probably avoid Fudge and Umbridge, but...

To be fair, though, a caste system would be a fine thing to start with to write a darker take on the series. It's just that most people don't go for diversity or diversity and power both but instead for only power with some random numbers to show how strengthly their OC-with-Harry's-name is.

In fact, it's sad that instead of going terribly wrong and resulting in a good take on it, the concept usually goes terribly wrong in that the execution is sub-par and it's not really used for anything.

But hey, a nice list.
