My favorite insult toward Lucius Malfoy and other Death Eaters who pled the Imperius Defense is that each and everyone of them must be WEAKLINGS! Weak-willed, etc to have been under the Imperius Curse for THAT long when Harry Potter was able to break out of it quite easily. God I would love to see the look on Lucius Malfoy's face whenever I see that point come across in fan-fiction.
