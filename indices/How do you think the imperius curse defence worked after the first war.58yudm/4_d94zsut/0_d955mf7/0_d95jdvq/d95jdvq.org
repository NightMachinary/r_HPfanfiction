I would agree with you, for Crouch jr. Voldemort's Imperius would be just like his Crucio. Harry openly admits that it was more difficult to throw off Voldemort's control when compared to Crouch Jr.

Also, Voldemort couldn't /possess/ Harry without pain. He could easily control him. The biggest thing is that Voldemort told Harry to do something point blank that Harry did not wish to do. He did not want to duel, he did not want to bow, he did not want to show this monster any respect whatsoever.

Also, Dumbledore could have easily been there. He states that "I do not need a cloak to become invisible Harry" all the way back in the first couple of years. I do not see Crouch Jr. doing anything with Dumbledore potentially watching. Even a subliminal Imperius Curse. We also never see an imperius curse in Hogwarts outside of that lesson. Malfoy imperios someone /outside/ the castle, In fact, I would not be surprised if Hogwarts offers protection against the curse for her students while in her walls.

We see that the Crucio Curse works via word of mouth (Book 7, Neville's D.A.) Yet, they are able to still attend classes. Which makes no sense, because Harry was forced into bed rest for over two days.

Hogwarts logically must provide students with some protection from such curses. Sectumsempra should have tore through Malfoy, especially if Harry was trying to injure Malfoy. Snape's didnt just cut off George's ear, but left a /hole/ in the side of his head. And from Snape's memories, it was a graze, not a full on hit.

Logically, Hogwarts must offer protection to students. Especially from dark Magic.
