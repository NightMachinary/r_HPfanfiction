I actually think Harry is not as good at braking the Imperius curse as Harry and readers are led to believe.

Both times he is put under the person does it right to his face so he immediately know he is under the curse which I doubt was the case during the war. And even then Harry was the only one is in class to throw the curse off.

For all we know crouch Jr. Kept the rest of the student under the curse for the rest of the year with the order to go about there life's as they normally would. So Harry spent the rest of the year surrounded by sleeper agents.

In canon I think the amount of people who could throw off the Imperius curse that told people to go about there lives as normal could be counted on two hands with fingers left over.

Which would have been very dangerous for people trying to fight against Voldemort to trust each other to be reliable in a fight.
