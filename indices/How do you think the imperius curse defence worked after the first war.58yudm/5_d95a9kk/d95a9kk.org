Well, I usually explain it away with several reasons working together.

Bribes and networking. Old, rich families worked to get their young, foolish heirs off. It helps that they were judged by the Wizengamot, and not independend judges, since I assume for my stories that the Wizengamot is like the Lord's House, not elected. But a few bribes to the Ministry didn't hurt either.

There were numerous actual Imperius victims and Dumbledore didn't want a witch hunt and purges happen, which could get out of control easily. He would rather see a few guilty go free than punish an innocent or see mob "justice" be done.

People were willing to accept any excuse so they didn't have to face the fact that their friends were monsters.
