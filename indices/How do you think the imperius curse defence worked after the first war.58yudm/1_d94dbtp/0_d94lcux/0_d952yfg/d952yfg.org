I was under the impression that we didn't have a date for the Longbottom attacks. If I had to guess at a date, it would be much later. Karkaroff was found, arrested and retrial-ed, all with Crouch at full power. The only one who supported the subsequent trial for Bagman was also him. Besides, we know that he was shunted to the Department of magical Co-operation soon after the incident.
