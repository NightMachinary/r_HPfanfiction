Personally, I think a combination of bribes and placing themselves under Imperius and memory charms.

So the Death Eater has someone they trust place the Imperius Curse on them, so like, Narcissa could place the Imperius on Lucius, for example. Then, Narcissa Obliviates the memory from Lucius, and lifts the Imperius Curse after. Then, bribery makes sure the questions asked at trial under Veritaserum sound thorough, but are actually full of loopholes.

e.g., Were you placed under the Imperius Curse? Yes. When were you placed under the Imperius Curse? I don't know. Who placed you under the Imperius Curse? I don't know. As best as you can guess, who placed you under the Imperius Curse? A supporter of the Dark Lord. When did you come out of your trance? After the Dark Lord fell.

Hence, it sounds like Lucius was secretly put under the Imperius Curse without him noticing, or was put under the Imperius Curse and the perpetrator Obliviated Lucius so that their identity wouldn't be found out. And Lucius, crafty Slytherin that he is, probably came up with answers that said everything and nothing.
