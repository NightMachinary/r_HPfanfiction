Based of real life per thousand birthrates, there's only about 3-4,000 magical people in the UK after the war, Muggleborns included.

Hp Lexicon list 30 named death eaters, some of which went to Azkaban, some of which went down fight and others, like Karkarov ratted out others to avoid time.

So I imagine that it's basically those few people that show up at the graveyard in book 4 that could have possibly used that particular defense.

I think Malfoy's pardon was cynical in nature. Here's a bunch of wealthy well established bloodlines, that because of the low population are very important to the wizarding world. the war was over, no one wanted to continue the fight and Malfoy comes up with a way for everyone to pretend that he and his cronies aren't monsters.

In short the Wizengamot chose what was easy over what was right.

Finally we see in book 7, when the Minister is Imperiused, that the wizarding world has no real defense against the curse, probably why it's an unforgivable in the first place. Look at the examples given in the later books about victims of the curse, they perform horrible acts, no worse in nature than what the Death Eaters were doing.
