I've always liked the idea of accidental magic being you trying to protect yourself essentially or responding to deep desires. Because little kids typically, for lack of a better explanation, feel things more strongly than older people, their magic manifests more often. Like comparing when your a little kid and when you get older being you get told you can't have a cookie but you really want a cookie. The little kids magic gets it. As you get older this happens less often. I also like likening it to belief. Wizard raised kids only see magic done with a wand and all magical kids get a wand at eleven being told “this is how you do magic” so the mere knowledge that you use wands and learn how to cast spells means your controlling your magic. I see wandless vs wand magic being like an artist using a shitty paintbrush and a high quality paintbrush. Both work but one works better with control. The wand being a conduit to help you shape direct and power your spells the way you want whereas wandless is more primal or basic.
