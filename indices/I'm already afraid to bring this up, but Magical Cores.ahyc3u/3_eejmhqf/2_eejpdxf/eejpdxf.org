I think your rendition of the canon magic works is accurate - at least I can say I agree with everything you say about how it seems to work in the books.

The whole point of the fic I'm trying to write is my own curiosity about where and how the magic comes to be. To expand on the whole thing in detail without changing the outcome (-ish?). So it's bound to get a little more meta then "they just have it" - but I'm a biologist, so that's understandable. I look for answers. An infinite source of unimaginable power that you get from basically the void brings so many questions to mind that I can't even decide where to start on it.

I find your reasoning interesting. And don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to be a bitch and argue for the sake of arguing, I really just want to discuss this peacefully. You kind of come off as if you were saying "it just is, don't go meta, just accept it".

If you have, as you say, infinite magic, it would be logical if in the beginning, everything you do with magic is wild and scary and uncontrolled, because you don't have control over it. This sounds a lot like accidental magic, but more volatile, so I can concede this is canon. But either the accidental magic goes away on its own (as we don't see adults having accidents), or at the very instant you pick up a wand. What happens or what changes there? Does your ability to do magic change the instant you get told "you're gonna have a magical education, just calm down now"? Is it puberty? Or do you kind of "tame" the magic by understanding it better? And what makes wantless or silent casting so difficult? What happens when you improve your skill in something? What changes?

These are the questions I'm looking to flesh out.
