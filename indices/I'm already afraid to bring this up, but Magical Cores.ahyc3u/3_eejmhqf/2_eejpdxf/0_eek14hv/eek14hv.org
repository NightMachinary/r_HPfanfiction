  What happens or what changes there? Does your ability to do magic change the instant you get told "you're gonna have a magical education, just calm down now"? Is it puberty? Or do you kind of "tame" the magic by understanding it better? And what makes wantless or silent casting so difficult? What happens when you improve your skill in something? What changes?

  These are the questions I'm looking to flesh out.

Those are interesting questions to ask, and I hope your answers makes for a good fic ;)

My point really is that a lot of the usual ways magical cores come into play eradicate one of the most wonderful parts of HP magic - the part where there is no limit by birth. Nobody is just born powerful. Your own efforts, interest and dedication bring you to power. It was a great message back when I first read the books.

Which also means I'm less argueing against them on a in-world logic, but more a meta-level where I critique them for being detrimental to the story and the feel of the HP world as a whole. You'll notice on my other posts that I have very little against extreme AUs otherwise.

My in-world take on all this is that the less your mind is driven by blind instinct (note: instinct, not emotion), the more you have it under control. A baby or toddler has bouts of accidental magic when very basic desires are threatened or unfulfilled. Children have them too, but less and sometimes they restrict their magic, but once they reach a certain age of maturity, they can be trained to control it better, with the final step being full maturity at (apparently) 17.

And as to where it comes from: Maybe from the same """place""" gravity and time come from? Maybe magic is just a force of the universe that so happens to concentrate in some people, animals, plants and objects. I don't know, but maybe you'll find an entertaining answer while writing.
