The thing with infinite magic is that it makes the fic infinitely harder to write. I mean even JKR didn't really do the duels well. It's hard for an author to try and be clever in their usage of magic when they're trying to portray literal geniuses with unlimited power like Dumbledore or Tom.

Magic cores work as a bit of a crutch. Instead of having to come up with this crazy battle where two gods with infinite magic available to them get in a fight, you just have these two dudes who fight until one gets tired. It's a lot easier, and I think that's really the heart of why magical cores are common.

That plus some people wanna be like Brandon Sanderson and quantify the magic system.
