  There are no videogame manapools you can deplete. The magic is infinite. Your knowledge and handling of it is what limits it.

Not to nitpick, but wouldn't it be possible to call exhaustion from doing too much magic "magical exhaustion"? Not in "Out of Mana", but simply "did too much of activity X, it was taxing and now they are exhausted". The term "magical" would simply be added to emphasise that it is not a sore muscle you could potentially fix with some potion but simply fatigue you need to sleep off.
