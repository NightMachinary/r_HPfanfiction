But then it would simply be "exhaustion". You haven't exhausted your magic, but simply your body/mind. Which is a condition perfectly described by "exhaustion" without the need for another adjective.

You also don't say "I have crossword-puzzle(-cal?) exhaustion", or "I have weightlift(cal?) exhaustion". (I don't know how to make those adjectives) You're just exhausted.

  The term "magical" would simply be added to emphasise that it is not a sore muscle you could potentially fix with some potion but simply fatigue you need to sleep off

Again, if it is my ability to do magic that is fatigued, we're back at the place I have criticized, back at the magical muscle, the manapool. If it is just my mind and body that is exhausted from an ongoing activity (casting magic and concentrationg on that), I am simply exhausted.
