Granted, the Allure has a wide spectrum of uses in fanfics. Yet magical exhaustion is 90% of the time "Oh no, I have cast X spells that require Y magic. I must rest." In the vast amount of the other 10% its just a throwaway phrase.

"Magical exhaustion" is the HP fanon for a depleted manapool. Its just that easy and just that asinine. If you want to rewrite the meaning in a fanfic, go ahead, I'd gladly read it at least once. But don't pretend like anyone in this sub, or maybe even this fandom would misunderstand this specific set of adjective and noun as anything but the lame attempt to quantify and therefore destroy the HP magic system, for whatever reason.
