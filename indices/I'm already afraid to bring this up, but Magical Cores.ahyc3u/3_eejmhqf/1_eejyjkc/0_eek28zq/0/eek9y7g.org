Yes, and while "weightlifting exhaustion" is not a thing, usually you will hear a sentence like "Man, I am tired from pumping iron for two hours straight" or something similar (and less ridiculous). The correct term would be "exhaustion from casting magic all day long", but since that is a mouthful, "magical exhaustion" might establish itself.

It's the "Veela allure vs Alluring properties of (large groups of) Veelas" debate all over again.
