I'm probably one of the most vocal anti-magical core advocates on the sub (as the flair would suggest), so have this disclaimer before reading what I have to say.

As far as I can tell, the source of magic in Harry Potter are the wizards and witches themselves. They don't soak up magic like a sponge, they don't have to harvest it from the multiverse, they just, simply, /have it/. An infinite amount of magic within the infinity of their soul.

In theory, I don't have anything against magical cores. In practicality, however, they are often synonymous with a few things I */hate/* in fanfiction with the burning passion of a thousand suns.

The great part about HPs magic is that the only limitation at birth seems binary. You either have it or you don't. What follows is your own dedication, willpower, hard work, intelligence and wisdom that determines how "powerful" a wizard or witch you can be. There are no limitations on the magic itself. So when I then read about "magical exhaustion", or powerlevels, or the equivalents of manapools you can deplete, my eye starts to twitch and I nope out of a fic at the end of the sentence. Its no longer Harry Potter at that moment. Its just some garbage spinoff, second rate copy of Harry Potter.

There are no magical muscles you can train up to "lift more magic", or whatever. There are no DragonBall-esque powerlevels. There are no videogame manapools you can deplete. The magic is infinite. Your knowledge and handling of it is what limits it.
