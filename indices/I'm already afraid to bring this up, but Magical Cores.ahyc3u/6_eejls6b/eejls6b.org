There are various reasons for the instant cringe-fest which starts up at the mention of magical cores and I can honestly relate to most of those sentiments.

My thoughts on the concept and its inclusion are thus:

Firstly I think that most authors use them to somehow formalise the nature/working of magic and furthermore make it something quantifiable. It is already debatable, if even the formalising part is wise. I think one of the most magical things about the world of Harry Potter, is that you don't exactly understand how magic works. What's more, it is depicted as something unknowable. But even if you want to make it knowable, understandable, it is a worse mistake to make it quantifiable. That just creates the bad RPG/anime-esque easily understood power-levels, which can turn a fic into a bad shounen. Anyone should try to avoid that.

I've seen magical cores done in not instantly cringy ways, but that's rare, and no fanfics immediately come to mind.

If you wanna go with the body-is-a-conduit idea, go with it, but what I don't get is why do you need magical cores then. Invent your own terminology, and keep in mind that it pays to keep a lot of things vague. Gives you more freedom, and if you do it right it keeps magic magical. (I'd advise against the using the 'magical sight' trope though. That too, often feels like a shortcut for the MC to become God.)

I've seen various approaches to the interpretation of Harry Potter magic, but my favourite ones were always the ones which dealt with this inherent anomaly, with the unknowable-ness of magic. Also read Taure's guide to the canon magic system, it helps at to get an idea of what's there, and maybe will help you determine what do you want to change, where to elaborate, to expand. It is a very tempting to revamp the whole thing and then get to a point where 'Wizards (or maybe British Pureblood Stupid Wizards) just don't know how to magic', and that's very easy to fuck up -- I mean if you disregard canon, do it in a smart, believable way.

Takes on HP magic I liked (these are of the rare variety where 'wizards don't know how to magic' is done well):

HPMoR -- there was shitloads of obnoxious critique going around, but it was still well grounded.

Deal with the Devil -- the new take on wand dependency and the components of casting magic in general is also very interesting.

Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus -- here magic comes from the slow disintegration of reality. it is essentially reality-glitch manipulation (lol).

The Weapon -- here the magic sense / wandless magic thing is done reasonably not-terribly.

Another thing to consider when going the conduit route is that why are there muggles then? And why are there a lot of creatures, which don't have the muggle-wizard-duality? What determines if a life-form is a conduit or not? The more fleshed-out your system is, the more of these kinds of avenues you need to consider. If you go toward consistency, there should be consistency. ... I know I'm just rambling now, but I hope there are some helpful things here for you.
