For something I have been casually writing on/off, I explained the purebloods' idea of 'purebloods are better and stronger' as them simply being around magic and using it before they go to Hogwarts. The more you use magic, the more powerful you get.

In that passage, I compare it to regular muscles in the way that more exertion creates bigger muscles, whereas less usage causes atrophy.

Because muggleborns don't (or hardly) /actively/ use their magic before Hogwarts, they are weaker. However, since purebloods (in my mind) seem to have a tendency to be lazy, they use magic less when they get out of hogwarts, at which point the muggleborns are still in love with what magic can do, and are therefore using it more.

Beyond that, I find the idea that using more magic, to the point of exhaustion, a better way of showing who is more powerful or knowledgeable, instead of simply saying "Oh, I was born with a bigger magical core than you, therefore I am superior." I feel like that takes a way a part of what could be characterization.
