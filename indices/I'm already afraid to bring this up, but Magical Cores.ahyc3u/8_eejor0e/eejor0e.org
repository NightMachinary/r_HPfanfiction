I find it more of an easy way out. As it stands in canon, there is nothing that indicates why exactly some wizards are stronger than others, or why spells themselves have various degree of difficulty. Magical cores easily explain this by making it intrinsic to each wizard, much like Midichlorians in SW. I am not opposed to this idea per se, but I would like to see more interesting/creative ways of doing it.
