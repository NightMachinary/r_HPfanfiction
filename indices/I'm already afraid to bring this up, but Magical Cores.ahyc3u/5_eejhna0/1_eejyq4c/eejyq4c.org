I always think of the core as a magic mussel. Some people are born with them just bigger then others, but it is possable to work them out and make them bigger and less resistant to stress (heavy use). When there is anything done in the real world one gets tired, so I think magic cores are good since they are just another mussel. I think that giving all things magic cores are a good idea (minus humans and squibs, since if someone is born without an arm they cannot use the arm mussel). For magic creatures and plants I would make how the core works differnt in the same way ours and hourses leg mussels are different. They are used differently.

Well thats my 2 cents.
