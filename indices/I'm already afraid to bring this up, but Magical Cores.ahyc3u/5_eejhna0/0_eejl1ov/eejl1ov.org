Pre-determined strength is a weird concept to me too. It sends the wrong message, and an 11 year old noob OP wizard is a recipe for disaster anyway (chaos magic, doom). I'd rather they work or train to get better - and even that has a very resonable limit, like with athletes in real life. I'm leaning more towards the concept of capability increasing with age, but even that has to truncate at some point, and then you have to work reasonably hard to get better on top of that.

You do bring a valid point up by aptitude, thanks! It's only natural that some people are better at A, while others are good at B or C. Thanks for the pointers!
