Is it really relevant to the plot? Is it to explain why your character is suddenly so badass or weak? Or do you want to do some world building and explain magic in more detail? Frankly I like the idea of magic being ... well magical. Unexplainable. In some ways always unfathomable. I think person's magical strength is influenced by intelligence, strength of will and emotions. You can take any of these 3 "components" if you will and build your theory from there.
