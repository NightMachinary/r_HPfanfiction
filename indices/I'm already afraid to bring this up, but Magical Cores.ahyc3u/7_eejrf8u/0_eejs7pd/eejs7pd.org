The main reason I want to introduce theory of magic is because I plan to introduce prosthetics and augmentations (NOT goblin made) that can do magic, and it interests me how they'd mesh with the user. I'd quite possibly only include part of the theory in the actual writing, because I don't want to infodump, but it's something that's been on my mind for over a year, so I decided I'd do something with it.
