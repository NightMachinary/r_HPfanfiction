The absolutely worst thing you can do with magical cores is to add the concept to "romances" as another "big-dick" thing to have for the MC. You would be surprised how often you will find something akin to:

  Hermione: "Wow, Harry is such an awesome lover. When he was nailing me with his twelve inches..."

  Daphne: "What were you expecting, his magical core is 5684 of arbitrary unit."

  Hermione: "I knew about the correlation between core and penis size, but I never expected Harry to be that big"

  Daphne: "He had to be because he defeated Voldemort and Dumbledore, who were 4981 and 5147."

I feel like [[/u/UndeadBBQ]] might disagree because his objections are more towards the overall balance and mechanics of the HP universe, but to me, random power wanks, or "stats" which show how "awesome" the MC is, are way worse than simply breaking the balance. Especially since they are often added unnecessarily. Harry is an awesome character, but that comes from the "everyday hero" archetype, not him being some kind of superhuman. Also, the depiction of the role of women in such fics is often very off-putting because it goes way beyond D/s and straight into servitude. And the concept of magical cores is often just a paper-thin justification for that, because witches are often attracted and submit themselves to a wizard with a big core (seriously, this is a surprisingly popular thing).
