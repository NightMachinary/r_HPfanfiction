  I've seen a lot of fics with the notion that no hand=no magic, or if you lost your dominant hand, you'd have to relearn everything with the other, and I guess it became ingrained that some kind of impairment is inevitable?

An analogy I like to use is to think of the ability to cast magic as one's ability to paint (or draw, or your artistic medium of choice). There's no 'painter's core' in someone which governs how good their paintings are, just their ingrained experience and knowledge. Children are able to finger-paint, but they have neither the tools nor experience to make anything even approaching the same level of a master artist. (This would apply to wandless magic as well, you can certainly paint something without a paintbrush, but without specifically training for it means you'll get results not much better than the child's).

Then, losing one's hand isn't so apocalyptic. Obviously it will affect them, as you say some impairment is inevitable, but it shouldn't restrict one's ability to do magic, just the immediate quality of the spells which result. It's not unimaginable that after re-training themselves to either cast with their off hand or with a prosthetic, the wizard or witch would be back up to their former level, or even differ somewhat due to the different method of casting (like maybe they develop a proficiency for Charms, when they were previously best with Transfigurations?) Just my two cents.
