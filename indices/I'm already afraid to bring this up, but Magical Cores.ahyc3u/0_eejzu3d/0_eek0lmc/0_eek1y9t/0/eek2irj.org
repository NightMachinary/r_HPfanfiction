I've seen a lot of fics with the notion that no hand=no magic, or if you lost your dominant hand, you'd have to relearn everything with the other, and I guess it became ingrained that some kind of impairment is inevitable?

Wow, that's a lot of big words. But yeah. I've been primed to believe it matters, but what you say makes sense, and would make for a good bit of comedy/frustration all in one.
