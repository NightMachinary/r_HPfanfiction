The most important rule I suppose is that while magic can technically do almost anything, it's only true limitations involve distance and time. So the larger the target object is or the further away it is or the longer you want the spell to last, the less likely it is that the magic will work for very long, if at all. That's why Hermione thought that even McGonagall might not be able to transfigure a dragon, because at dozens of feet tall it was on the edge of what was possible to transfigure all at once.
