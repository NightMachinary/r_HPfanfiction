Harry casts Lumos in OoTP when the wand is a few feet from his hand. It should be noted that wands have their own magic as well and Phoenix wands are known to be prone to self casting, so it's unclear if this is an example of casting without being in contact with the wand.

I don't really know the answer to the thickness bit (lol), but we know that, for example, if you wanted to make a wizard levitate with the Levitation Charm you have to direct it at their clothes since that spell doesn't work on people directly.
