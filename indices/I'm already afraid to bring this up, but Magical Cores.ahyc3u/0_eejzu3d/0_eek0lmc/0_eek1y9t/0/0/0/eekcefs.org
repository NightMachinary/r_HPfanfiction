Actually, that poses another important and nerdy question. How far can you step away from a wand and still get it to cast, let's say, a Lumos? Do we see examples of it in canon? I can't recall. This might be a viable training method to go wandless, though - i just realised.

And what is a thickness of material that reliably absorbs magic? (Eg. you didn't hit me, you hit my shirt? - for pure comedy value)
