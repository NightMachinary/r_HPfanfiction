That impromptu quotation honestly made me laugh out loud.

Let me put your worries to rest - I'm not looking to write a powerwank harem fic. I'm really just curious about the inner workings of magic so that I can flesh out how one might improve their own ability, and so that I can introduce prosthetics and augmentations that help restore/enhance their abilities within reason. Emphasis on the restore. Specifically - If you lose your hands and get fake limbs, can you do magic with them, or are you screwed? Maybe that should have been the question I posted, but I felt a general query might bring more results.
