This is rather the point - your question illustrates the absurdity of treating HP magic as energy. Because HP magic can do things that would require huge amounts of energy to replicate through physical means, and can do other things that no quantity of physical energy would allow you to do. But at the same time there are some things magic cannot do which would not necessarily require a very large amount of energy.

The reason is of course that magic's capabilities are dictated by magical law, not physical law, and magical law largely ignores stuff like energy.

On balance, if a fanfic absolutely must treat magic as physical energy, then I would prefer a level of energy which preserves as many canonical magical feats as possible, which means giving wizards access to huge amounts of energy - a single Aguamenti requires significantly more energy than the largest ever nuclear bomb, and wizards can cast it casually. That's not even starting on time travel.
