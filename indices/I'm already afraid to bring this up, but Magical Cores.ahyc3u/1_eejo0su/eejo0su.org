Three fundamental problems with magical cores:

1. Wizards being able to run out of magic. Generally used to nerf the capabilities of wizards (often with wizards only being able to cast a truly pathetic number of spells before they get tired, even though we see them relying on magic to do everything in canon).

2. Magical power being in some sense equivalent to physical energy, so that you can say how much energy a wizard has access to and what amount of energy therefore can overcome the wizard. I much prefer the system of magic simply overruling the physical universe, with the limits of magic being set by magical law. Again, generally used to nerf the capabilities of wizards.

3. Magic as fuel being "burnt" to do work tends to result in authors conceiving of magic in an overly physical way - brooms have an invisible source of physical thrust, or a curse creates its effect through biological processes (e.g. Cruciatus Curse something something nerve endings). This tends to blinker authors to the more abstract and wacky aspects of magic (which are often the most powerful magical acts) and so in turn nerfs the capabilities of wizards.

TL;DR magical cores generally results in much weaker wizards than in canon. I /might/ be satisfied by a system in which each wizard's magical core contained at least as much energy as makes up the physical universe, but even then I would probably have in the back of my mind the niggling disappointment that wizards had been unnecessarily weakened.
