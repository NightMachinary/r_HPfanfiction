In my headcannon. I think Magic is a force that gives the ability for someones mind to alter reality. Magic is just the the instability to allow it to happen. Some people are naturally attuned to magic and it allows them a easier time to manipulate this force. All wands do is give focus on the intent of how you are trying to manipulate this reality force. As more magic is used in an area the easier it is to manipulate the reality of that area. Conversely, even if the area is devoid of magic it really isn't. It is always there and present, just that magic is like a force of nature. And using wands allows them to be conscious of manipulating it. And a very few can do some very basic things like wandless summoning but that is all.
