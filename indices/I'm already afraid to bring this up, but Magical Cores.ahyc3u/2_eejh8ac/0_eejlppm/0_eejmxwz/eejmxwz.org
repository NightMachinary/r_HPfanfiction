What I'm saying is the idea that everyone has a magical signature that is recorded and can be tracked and everything from lumos to fiendfyre from the same person would have the same magic signature that could be detected and tracked, including the exact spell used. I always loved the idea of talented wizards being able to sense magic with a lot of practice and skill but even then be more generalized, like you said with Dumbledore being able to sense the intent of the magic and figuring it out. I think I saw it best done in a scene of Harry Potter and the Boy who Lived by The Santi. I can't remember what stories I remember it from but my favorite idea of magical cores has always been where young kids legitimately can't do things like protego or the stunning spell because of their age, whether it be because of raw magical power or skill.
