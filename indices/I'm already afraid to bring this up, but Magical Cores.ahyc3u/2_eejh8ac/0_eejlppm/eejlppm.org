Haven't checked CV out yet, I'll look into it. But yeah, I like the concept of only discussing something if it is relevant.

Are you talking about magical signatures regarding tracking a person? It was a bit unclear to me what you tried to say. What that brings to mind is Dumbledore can sense powerful magic being present in canon, or at least he could decipher the intent behind the spells guarding the locket horcrux, so I imagine it's just an obscure and hard to muster skill that's not directly applicable to identification.

Oh, don't get me started on the master occlumens trope! The mindscapes in those kinds of stories have me rolling on the floor laughing. I mean, sure. Okay. Be an occlumens. But that has to also have a power curve! And telepathic speech just... no.
