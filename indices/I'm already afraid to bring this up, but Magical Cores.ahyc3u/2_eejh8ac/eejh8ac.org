Magical signatures are a bigger turn off for me than cores. Like I can see the cores and all, maybe make it so that the magic core is directly connected to the soul/body, like a person can do things to make their magic flow better. I liked how A Cadmean Victory did it. The only time it was acknowledged was when something was done regarding it. Magical signatures on the other hand, I can't see how that could work seeing as there are death eaters who were never caught or even suspected. Also I avoid stories with a passion that have the MC meditating and “looking inward” to find their magical core and suddenly their master occlumens capable of doing anything because reasons.
