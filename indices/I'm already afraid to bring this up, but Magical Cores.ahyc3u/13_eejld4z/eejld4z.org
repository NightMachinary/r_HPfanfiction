[[/u/UndeadBBQ]] is the only unbiased person on this topic. :)

The main problem it they're treated as DBZ-style power levels that can be introduced so Harry has an immediate excuse for becoming OP. Not to mention they seem to go quite against the grain of how HP conceives of magic and magical power. In canon some wizards are at times said to be more magically powerful than others in some way that is not entirely unquantifiable, but making it just some ever increasing reservoir of magic sauce makes it feel way too concrete. Why can Harry do that awesome magic now? Intense emotion? Long study and practice? Nope, he just " unblocked his core".

Ok
