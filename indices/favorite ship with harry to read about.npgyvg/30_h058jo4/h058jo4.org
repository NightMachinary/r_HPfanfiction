There's so much potential for Harry and Ginny that's never realized, it pains me. But at the same time, if I see a Harry/Ginny pairing, I skip over it because their relationship is so...underdeveloped and boring in canon.

I don't read a ton of romantic works, but I love adversarial relationships in Harry's life. They are typically much more interesting and well characterized than romantic subplots- Harry and Draco being constantly at odds yet forced to work together, is a trope I will never tire of. And conflicts between Tom Riddle and Harry can become fascinating internal dramas.

I love romances with teeth for long stories, and fluff for short oneshots.
