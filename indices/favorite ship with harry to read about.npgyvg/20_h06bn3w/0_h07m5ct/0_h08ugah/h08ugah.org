There have been a few great portrayals of her: I can't remember names, but there was one where she was just a regular girl trying to win over Harry's (suspicious) friends due to the stigma of being a Slytherin (it had Hermione feeling jealous after she realized she was in love with Harry) in their Sixth:

One where she was sort of "not there" in the head and was obsessed with ice-cream -- Astoria helped set her and Harry up in that little sister way:

Another where the Greengrass family curse hits her another way -- basically, she's not dying like Astoria, but she can only be perceived by one or two people in her life, and one of those rare people just happens to be Harry. Other people just sort of forget she's there/her identity, like she's under the perception filter from Doctor Who.

That's the sort of originality I like to see, personally; not just a "lulz super intelligent political lady at thirteen/fourteen/fifteen/sixteen".
