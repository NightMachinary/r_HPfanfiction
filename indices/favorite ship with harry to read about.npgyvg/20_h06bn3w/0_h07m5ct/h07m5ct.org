  I love Harry/Katie. Unfortunately, she's typically used just as one of three props in a shitty harem story (with Angelina and Alicia).

  I like Daphne Greengrass too, but... sigh, the Ice Queen thing has become her de facto character for people. She's a cookie-cutter character now, instead of being a blank slate with a few canonical/extrapolated details people can use to write their "own" Daphne Greengrass (it's why I love subversion like where she's a ditz, or just a regular girl, as thick as two short planks, can talk to turtles, or is a chatterbox). Originality, people! Come on!

I avoid romance like the plague nowadays, but I find that the former, when written well, combines the best parts of Cho and Ginny as characters.

I kinda agree with Daphne as written in fanfiction. It's refreshing to read a not super intelligent love interest.
