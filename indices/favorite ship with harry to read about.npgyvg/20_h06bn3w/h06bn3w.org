I'm not into slash at all, so the pairings like Harry/Malfoy are a no-go for me.

The more unusual the girl he's with, the more I'm interested. Unfortunately, a lot of the more under-used girls are merely used as props in shitty harem stories. :(

I'm put off by Harry/Hermione due to how repetitive it can be (especially since it's a staple of Indie-Harry cliche-fests), but I'd be happy to read a fic that has him with Hermione or Ginny if it's well-written and unusual -- L, L, & LL's earlier chapters/premise of her and Harry being thieves and just stealing people's shit and acting like a cute married couple, for example.

I *love* Harry/Katie. Unfortunately, she's typically used just as one of three props in a shitty harem story (with Angelina and Alicia).

I like Daphne Greengrass too, but... sigh, the Ice Queen thing has become her de facto character for people. She's a cookie-cutter character now, instead of being a blank slate with a few canonical/extrapolated details people can use to write their "own" Daphne Greengrass (it's why I love subversion like where she's a ditz, or just a regular girl, as thick as two short planks, can talk to turtles, or is a chatterbox). Originality, people! Come on!

Harry/Gabrielle is another pairing I'm becoming more interested in -- no, not when she's eight and Harry's fourteen (unless the author "up-ages" her, but then again that's just an OC with her name/face by then, or only if it's a sibling-like thing they develop and not a pairing), but when they're both older -- there's a recent fic where an underachieving, nineteen year old Gabrielle hates being in Fleur's shadow post-War, and she's set her eyes on Harry. It's a fascinating story that gives her depth. I forgot the name, though: Something Sororicide?

Harry/Lavender when she's not some Mary Sue "seer" or when she has more depth than a frying pan. Yes, I know that includes canon Lavender, haha.

Harry/Luna, when she's not some "seer" or other bullshit.
