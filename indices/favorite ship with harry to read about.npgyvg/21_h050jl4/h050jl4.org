Basically, anything different.

Hermione, Ginny/-ew,/ Fleur, and even Daphne are getting too basic nowadays for me.

I love Tonks, Astoria, and Luna. Unfortunately those are few and far between, or are harem fics, which are usually garbage.

Bellatrix can be interesting, but it's usually a harem for those stories too.

I also like muggle pairings- when it's not obviously a self insert.

And something I would love to see is a throuple with the Weasley twins. Either a fem!Harry or Fem!Twins because I honestly don't see Harry being into dudes. Not dissing it, it just doesn't fit my characterization of Harry.

The twins though, I could honestly believe they're bi. Speaking of which, I want a fic where the twins get up to some bi antics. It'd be hilarious.
