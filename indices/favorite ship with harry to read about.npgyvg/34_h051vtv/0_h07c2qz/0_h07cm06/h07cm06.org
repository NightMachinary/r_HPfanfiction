I honestly don't see why people should be ashamed to ship Tomarry. They are the ones who have the most fic potential. They have so much in common too... And they're quite literally soulmates! Tomarry has the best ennemies/rivals to friends to lovers fics.

People be shipping Harry with random ass characters and then sh*t on Tomarrys as if Tom Riddle wasn't the boy Harry described as exquisitely handsome every single time he saw him.
