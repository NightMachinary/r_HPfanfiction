Harry with a Hufflepuff (Susan)

Harry with a Ravenclaw (Cho or Luna)

Harry with a Slytherin (Tracy or one of the Blacks if time travel)

Harry with a Gryffindor (Katie or Oliver... yes I know random)

Harry with Fleur or Gabrielle is always fun as is the occasional Harry - Viktor (as the Durmstrang ship is impressive in Lego or on screen) just to avoid the constant onslaught of Harry with Hermione Draco or Daphne
