I used to love drarry and I would still read a fan fiction if it's in there but I don't seek it. The only reason I would still read it, is if it's cute and not smut. And the reason I don't ship it I realized they are basically cousins and I don't really like that. But I'd a story is good then I can get past the shipping. So I think my favorite ship now with Harry would be I believe Daphne and Harry (I think that's her name) but I don't purposely find it. And I rather just read a good story with hints of romance. Not actual romance lol
