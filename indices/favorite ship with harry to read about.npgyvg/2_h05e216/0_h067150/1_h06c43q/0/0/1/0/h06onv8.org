  Harry is doing quite alright after the war. He's not going back to Hogwarts, but it's not like anyone can blame him for not going back to where he died, and he's still getting his NEWTs remotely. He's fine, he's busy renovating his house and getting rid of all the unsavory bits of magic scattered all over the place, and he doesn't really need anyone's help. Except, Narcissa Malfoy is suddenly there, week after week to make sure he doesn't destroy her family's legacy, and then she keeps coming back even after Harry's done with the place. Somehow they become friends? Harry has no idea how that happened, but he decides he likes it very much. Likes her maybe a bit more than that, too.
