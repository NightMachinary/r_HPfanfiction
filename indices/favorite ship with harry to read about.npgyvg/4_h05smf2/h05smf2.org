Time Travel Harry/Bella is probably my favourite but there are extremely few fics with it. Because of that, I'm okay with most girls.

BUT:

- I'd rather avoid H/Hr. I don't hate Hermione, it's only that those fics are usually boooring.

- no harem. I won't read harem under any circumstances at all

- no Ginny, no Lavender, neither of the Patil girls, no Parkinson and no OC. OC is usually a SI and I'd rather watch grass grow than read a SI fic.
