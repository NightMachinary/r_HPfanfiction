Harry/harem, because single pairing stories tend to get boring and samey for me when they're in the hundreds of thousands of words, which is about all I read.

Besides, someone who has had as terrible a childhood as Harry has deserves all the love he can get as far as I'm concerned. Likewise, Harry tends to be humble, selfless, kind, charismatic, wealthy, has a propensity for saving girls, and at least in the stories I like to read, powerful, so it frankly makes no sense to me that only one girl would be attracted to him in a "real" way, so the most realistic way to have a single pairing story would be for multiple women to be attracted to him and fighting over him, with him having to choose one and hurt all the others. Most writers aren't capable of handling that level of drama, and most readers aren't really interested in reading it.

Particular harem members - or single ships in rare cases - I'm fond of would be: Bellatrix Narcissa Tonks Fleur Cho Astoria

I don't really have a problem with any of them, but Hermione, Ginny, and to a lesser extent Daphne and Luna have been done to death, so as a single pairing I'm just not interested in those. I'll read single pairing stories with the Black Sisters, Fleur, Tonks, and Astoria, as most of those are barely ever used so I feel like there's some uniqueness to them.

I'll admit Goblet of Fire is my favorite book in the series, and the one I feel has the most "fanfiction potential," so that's probably why I'm so willing to read Harry / Fleur.
