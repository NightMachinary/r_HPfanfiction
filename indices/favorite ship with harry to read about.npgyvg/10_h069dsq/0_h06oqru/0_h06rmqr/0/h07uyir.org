Oh, you can grab it off [[http://ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=jacobapples&sort=title][ff2ebook]]. They moved their completed stuff to a different account, but made a mess of things in the process - copy/pasted the entire fic, headings and notes included, and reuploaded it as a single chapter. There's a time travel version of it too, but it's kind of odd tbh. Found in the Ashes, I think?

I'd recommend grabbing the oldest version of the fic from that link.
