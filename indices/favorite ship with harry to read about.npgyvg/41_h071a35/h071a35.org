Harry/Daphne, Harry/Fleur, Harry/Bellatrix = I love Harry with a powerful witch.

Harry/Luna = movie made me ship them. Luna needs more love.

Harry/muggle OC = when it's not a SI, because I can see Harry dating a girl from his neighbourhood just so he can have something normal for once that doesn't involve everything that's wrong with the magical world.
