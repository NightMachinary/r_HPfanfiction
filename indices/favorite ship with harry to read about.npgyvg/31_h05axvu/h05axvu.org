Well, I never really liked the Harry x Ginny, and Harry x Hermione turned something boring recently (too much boring and I stopped liking Hermione as much as I did before).

So, I usually go for the only other interesting girl that had some closeness with Harry, little ol Luna. She is really fun to write and read, but at the same time can be interpreted in different ways so she never gets boring as a character.
