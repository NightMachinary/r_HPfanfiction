I like the idea of this: each major civilization or culture in history had its own attempt at things, the driving forces behind the Peverells' Death Hallow creation, and it resulted in unique artifacts/"Masters".

Like, a sacrificial dagger from MesoAmerica that, once spattered in human blood from its owner, allows voices from the Other Side to be heard; another, from Ancient Egypt in the form of an Ankh, allows the dead to briefly possess an inanimate doll version of themselves, or something.

On becoming a "Master", Harry is invited into an exclusive, international club where they chill out, drink booze, and talk shop (about magic, life, death, et cetera).
