There are unfortunately few of these about

!linkffn(Power is Control) is one of my all-time favourites of this pairing. While the grammar is a but shaky in the first few chapters, it picks up as the story progresses and goes some very interesting places. The sequel, !linkffn(Gaining Power), just updated today.

!linkffn(Descent by Aelursadgod) is a fem!Harry/fem!diary!Riddle fic. Diary Riddle absorbs Voldemort after deeming her insane and takes her place as the main soul and leader of the Death Eaters. Abandoned but still good.

!linkffn(Thunderstorm) is pretty vanilla, but a decent enough read.

!linkffn(Departure from the Diary) is my own contribution to the pairing, and I consider it one of my best works. Harry/fem!diary!Riddle. I've been doing my best to make Tamelyn into a complex and believable character who has her own motivations and justifications without trying to whitewash her.
