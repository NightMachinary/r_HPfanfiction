This expands more on a father-son type relationship than a mentor-student one. Dumbledore puts being headmaster on hold to adopt and raise Harry. A lot of it is light hearted, but the author doesn't avoid awkward conflicts and how the public affects Harry's and Dumbledore's relationship. Strongly recommend if you haven't read it already. Incomplete.

This shows snippets of their canon relationship, mostly through Fawkes who is incredible the entire time. It kills me that this is gonna end up canon-compliant. Strongly recommend, it's pretty wholesome. Incomplete.
