Well, I have “Recall Alice When She Was Just Small” by Harmonic Friction linkffn(3493409) and “Go Ask Alice When She's Ten Feet Tall” linkffn(3451695), where Dudley is far from being a good boy, but perhaps not.

Otherwise, all good-Dudleys I know about are post-war or at least post-Dementors (especially, “Dudley's Memories” by Paganaidd linkao3(601542) and very weird “Dudley Dursley and the Bee Hive by Jmso” linkao3(14869065)). I like Dudley in stories by [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Mrs_Granger]] (Summer is before Winter).

And then there is [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/cizi/Dudley_Dursley_and_the_New_Normal.epub][Dudley Dursley and New Normal]] (recovered from some fanfiction dump, reformatted by me; it was removed from FFnet).
