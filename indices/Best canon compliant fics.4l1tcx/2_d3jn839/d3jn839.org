HPMOR isn't what I would call canon compliant, but here are a few off my favourites list that are, as far as I can recall. Some may be sliiightly off but still pretty good.

I started off as a Lily/James fan then moved on to everything else, but believe me when I say all these fics have quality writing, regardless of main character (and there are some strange ones).

Ron focused, no epilogue - linkffn(5987922)

Not quite canon compliant, but a rehash of canon if Harry were the laziest person in the world. Hilarious, with two short sequels. - linkffn(6466185)

Technically canon compliant version of Voldemort's origin - linkffn(10129276)

Another technically canon compliant version of Voldemort, much more tragic but beautifully written - linkffn(5316529)

Best true to story origin of Snape, and I'm not even a Snape fan - linkffn(7937889)

Some of the best Dudley I've seen, a little look into what could've been the home life at Privet Drive - linkffn(3493409)
