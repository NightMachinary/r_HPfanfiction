Not directly related, but there's several follow-on stories for HPMOR that you might enjoy (not by the same author though) that you can find on [[/r/hpmor]] - generally linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Sealed Intelligence) is considered the best direct continuation, although I haven't read it. There's also more stories (both fanfiction and otherwise) in the same vein as HPMOR over at [[/r/rational]] although they're not Harry Potter stories.

HPMOR is a type of story usually called an 'AU' for 'Alternate Universe' - a story where some changes are made, which ripple outwards to form a new plot with slightly different characters and a changed setting. Canon-compliant ones are those that could exist in the same universe as the original series without any conflicts. An example of a good canon-compliant fic is linkffn(Some Say by Eraina). A lot of canon-compliant fics are short stories, also called one-shots, because there aren't that many gaps in canon where a long story could be inserted.

Some other canon-compliant stories are linkffn(Just a Random Tuesday by Twisted Biscuit; The Wendell that Wasn't; End of the Line by shewhoguards)

Some well-known and good stories that are AU, but might be more what you're looking for based on your post are linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon; The Lie I've Lived by jbern; Dimension Hopping for Beginners by nonjon; Seventh Horcrux by EmeraldAshes; The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks)

All of these stories are completed. Unfortunately, there are more fanfiction stories that are incomplete and 'dead' (i.e. the author is never going to finish them) than complete ones, including some of the best ones, but to start with these are probably more suitable.
