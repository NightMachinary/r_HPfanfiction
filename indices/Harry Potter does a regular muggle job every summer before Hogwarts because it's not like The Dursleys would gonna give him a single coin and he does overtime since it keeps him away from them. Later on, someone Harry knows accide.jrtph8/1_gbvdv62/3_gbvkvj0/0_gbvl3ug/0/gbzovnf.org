Nowadays, yes. Back in the day, and certainly during the period Harry Potter is set, you could do something like 13 weeks 'casual' requiring pretty much zero paperwork, no NI number required, paid in cash. Did it myself, a lot, working on building sites, in restaurants, in warehouses and an assortment of office jobs, mostly clerking at solicitors' firms.

It has been tightened up /considerably/ since then - the modern zero hours contract being nearly the same thing with all of the advantages removed from the employee side - on the principle that systems that wide open to abuse are only for the rich.
