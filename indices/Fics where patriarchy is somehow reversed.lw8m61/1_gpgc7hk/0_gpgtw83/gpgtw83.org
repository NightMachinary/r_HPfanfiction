Oh, Darthmarrs, your Firebird Trilogy is one of the most dystopian HP fanfics ever. Some people don't like how you made Lily to just be a spiteful bitch and not a revolutionary at heart (among other things)... but I loved it. It's an awesome series. Probably one of the staples of the fandom. I fully recommend it to everyone. Read it. It will change how you perceive certain concepts in Harry Potter.

P.S. I still think that the idea that muggles can't see spells (as in the rays of multi-coloured light) to be great. One of the best ideas I've seen.
