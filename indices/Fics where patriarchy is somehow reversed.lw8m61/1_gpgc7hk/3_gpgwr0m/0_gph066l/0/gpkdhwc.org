Sorry for saying this, but you totally deserve this. Were your fics the epitome of literary excellence, no! Were they extremely enjoyable and super fun to read? Fuck, yes! You have a very good imaginative mind and a competence in writing that very few fanfic authors have. Accept the praise for what it is, you are beyond awesome!
