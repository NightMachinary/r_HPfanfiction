Given that the comment was about Prince Harry going to Hogwarts, a life-changing event which would have altered his life's course drastically compared to how it turned out in reality, and his current life now?

Yup.

I suppose it's also because I'm a supporter of the Monarchy and have an immense dislike for such a terrible woman that turned a prince into a goddamn emotional abuse victim.

Again, I reiterate: Poor bastard. It would have been better for him to be a muggleborn wizard, if magic were real.
