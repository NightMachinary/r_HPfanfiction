One fanfic I have overall enjoyed, although it's cliches out the wazoo had one moment that just frustrated me to no end.

In /Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone/, Hermione, at the beginning of the year, has no friends. She is frequently showing off in class as well, and that puts her even farther away from her peers. It all comes to a head on Halloween when Ron Weasley gripes that she's terrible and she must have noticed that she has no friends, which leads her to cry for the rest of the day in the girls' toilet. Cue "TROLL! TROLL IN THE DUNGEON! Thought you ought to know."

Now, in the fanfic I was reading, Harry and Hermione met before school, and were best friends for years, to the point where Harry gave her a promise ring(though he was unaware of it's full significance at the time).

Cue Halloween, Ron's rude commentary, and Hermione /still/ spending all day crying in the bathroom because she apparently holds the words of a stranger in higher esteem than that of her close friend.

I still kept reading, but that ridiculously shoehorned in scene just annoyed the piss out of me. I'd have been less annoyed if she just had to go to the loo, and it was just remarkably bad timing.
