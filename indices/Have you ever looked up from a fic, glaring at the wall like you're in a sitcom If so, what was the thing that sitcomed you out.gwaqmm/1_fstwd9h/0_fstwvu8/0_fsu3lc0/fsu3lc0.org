Ew.

/EDIT/

It's funny. I greatly enjoyed some fics that literally did the same thing, but I suppose context is king.

The fic you're describing sounds like it's trying to be an original story without being original, and so the original text being there doesn't really serve any purpose.

I have, however, enjoyed the /MST3K/ format, where canon characters react to books/stories about themselves...

And I suddenly want to see canon characters reacting to fanfics that run entirely counter to their nature, like Draco reacting to Drarry or Dramione(Either would be hysterical, IMO). Except for Weasley. I really don't want to see canon Weasley reacting to a Weasley bashing fic. That just strikes me as being cruel and canon Weasley already has self-esteem issues.
