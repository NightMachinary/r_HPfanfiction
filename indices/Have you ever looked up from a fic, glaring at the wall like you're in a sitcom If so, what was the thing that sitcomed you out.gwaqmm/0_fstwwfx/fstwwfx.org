Wow literally so many times. I read a lot of hurt/comfort severitus type stories and stumbled upon like....a 15 chapter story wherein every.single.chapter Harry just.....pees on himself? Like the whole plot to the whole story is just Harry not making it to the bathroom and Snape cleaning it up.

On the first chapter I was like aww that's sad. Second chapter like...hmm interesting. Third chapter & I had that exact moment. Like ..I can't believe I was duped into reading this ðŸ˜‚
