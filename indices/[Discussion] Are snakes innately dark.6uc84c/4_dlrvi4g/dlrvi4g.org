Someone else made a thread on the subject of the basilisk and made a good point that the breeding of a basilisk was an inherently Dark process; You had to bespell a toad, likely with the Imperius curse, to sit on a chicken egg until it hatched. Doubtless there was more to it than that, because how you go from chicken to snake due to a fucking squatter toad is beyond even me. But that led me to a headcanon that I liked.

Parseltongue is a Dark ability not because you can control snakes, but because you can control the King of snakes. The Basilisk is a murder machine, plain and simple. Nothing with the ability to kill things with its eyesight is anything less than an apex predator. Fear of Parselmouths is much more understandable when said Parselmouths have their metaphorical finger on the trigger of a very lethal weapon, and you don't know when or on who they'll use it. It's basic fear of the unknown.

As for the rest of the species, it's likely that their dark roots are due purely to their animal nature. Snakes are cold blooded carnivores, and because of this are likely used in very dark rituals. Their classification as reptiles might drastically change how a ritual works and contribute to its dark nature. Hell, I'm sure using a crocodile would be even better, but no wizard wants to go hunting crocodiles, magical or otherwise. They're not crazy-ass muggles, after all.
