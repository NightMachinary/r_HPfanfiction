If we're going by the wiki, hatching a basilisk is a stupidly easy process. You can literally take the egg out from under the toad and hide it when company comes over, with no harmful effects to the egg. So not only are they easy to hatch, they're easy to hide as well. So I find it very reasonable that people are so afraid of Parselmouths. It's like knowing someone has a Conceal and Carry license, but never knowing if they're actually armed. And since basilisks are usually bred by dark wizards, you know the guy carrying is mentally unstable too.

Yeah, I'm not surprised at all that Harry was shunned in second year. More surprised he didn't get lynched.
