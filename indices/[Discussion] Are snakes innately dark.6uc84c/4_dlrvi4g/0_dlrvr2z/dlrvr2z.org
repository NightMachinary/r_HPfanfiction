You have now gotten me thinking about magical crocodiles. Surely there must be some. So anyway... I love this headcanon you have here. After all, the fellow behind the Basilisk Ritual was a Parselmouth himself. Maybe it /can/ only be performed by someone who speaks Parseltongue (though admittedly someone who did /not/ would be crazy to try if they had no means to control and/or educate the Basilisk afterwards).
