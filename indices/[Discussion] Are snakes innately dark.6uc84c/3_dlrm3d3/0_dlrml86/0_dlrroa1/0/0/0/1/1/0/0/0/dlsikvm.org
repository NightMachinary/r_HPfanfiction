But is that because he /couldn't/, or just that he didn't bother? With no particular need to talk to snakes and more pressing things (such as running a school and killing Voldemort) on his mind, Dumbledore may just not have gone the extra mile to learn how to speak it even though he /could/ have.

Copypasting from my answer to Averrant just above: that is how it is in the /real world/, but are we sure it is so with magic involved? I think HP snakes /do/ have a sense of hearing (and a developped one at that), but it's rooted in magic rather than biology and thus the Muggles don't know about it.
