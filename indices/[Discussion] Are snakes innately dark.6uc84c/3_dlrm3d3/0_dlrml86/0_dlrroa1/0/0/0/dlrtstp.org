I don't necessarily think it would stop a snake from understanding it. In fact, on Pottermore it said that "sometimes a strong imitation of it is enough for a snake to understand" (I don't know if this was written by JKR, btw).

Rather what I mean is that I think you would be unable to speak to a parselmouth. I don't think that hissing, even if accurately, would make a parselmouth understand you. How would it work? Do you just hiss, and then if the parselmouth doesn't understand, you... what? Make the /s/ longer or something and suddenly from the parselmouth's pov it goes from stupid hissing to english sounding?

If this is true, that someone simply hissing wouldn't be able to converse with a parselmouth, it proves that it's not just a language, but that there is something /more/ to it.
