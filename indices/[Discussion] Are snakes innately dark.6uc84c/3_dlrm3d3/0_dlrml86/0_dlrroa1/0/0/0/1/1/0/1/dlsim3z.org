That is how it is in the real world, but are we sure it is so with magic involved? I think HP snakes do have a sense of hearing (and a developped one at that), but it's rooted in magic rather than biology and thus the Muggles don't know about it. I do believe the Parselmouth gift would "translate" the snake's body language, but only in the sense that it would give you a feeling of what the expression means --- you'd understand the gestures just as you would understand what it means when a human smile, but it wouldn't be translated into /words/.
