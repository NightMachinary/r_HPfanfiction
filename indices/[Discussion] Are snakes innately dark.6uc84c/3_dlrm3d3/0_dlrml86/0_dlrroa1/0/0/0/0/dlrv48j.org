Being a Parselmouth, for me, is an old, complex bit of Translation Magic, the details of which were lost to history. How exactly incorrect Parseltongue would "translate" to a non-sophisticated Parselmouth like Harry is unsure and would be worthy of further study from someone like Hermione at some point.

If I had to guess (or, case in point, have such a scene in my fanfic), the result would be incorrect /English/: let's say the pseudoparselmouth is tryint to say SsssSs ("Hello there") but ends up saying SsSssS, which is gibberish but sounds more like the word for "Sugar plum" ("SsSsSS") than it does "Hello there" (SsssSs), the exchange would go something like:

*Person:* SsSssS

*Parselmouth:* ...I'm sorry, what? I thought you said something about sugar plums there for a moment.

*Person:* [Parseltongue Equivalent for No], SsssSS!

*Parselmouth:* OH! You must mean hello! That's... how did I even mishear that? That sounds nothing like... forget it.
