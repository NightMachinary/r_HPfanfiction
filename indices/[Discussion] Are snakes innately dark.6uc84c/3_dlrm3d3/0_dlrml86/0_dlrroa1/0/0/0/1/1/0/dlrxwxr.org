IIRC, only a portion of a snake's language is communicated through hissing. A majority is body language and scent. That is also where the magical part comes into play: The magic of a Parselmouth translates the full range of a snake's language into comprehensible words. It also translates the other way, allowing the snake to understand spoken Parseltongue, despite not having ears to hear with. That's why it's hard for a non-genetic Parselmouth to speak with snakes: the snakes are only feeling the vibrations from the noise and have a hard time comprehending what is said. Without the magic it's basically snake pidgin with a dash of radio static thrown in.
