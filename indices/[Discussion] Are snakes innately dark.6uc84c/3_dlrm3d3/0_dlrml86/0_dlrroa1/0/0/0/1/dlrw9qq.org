Quick thought: What if being able to learn Parseltongue was only half of the equation? If you learned it and spoke to a snake, the snake /might/ understand you... but you can't understand the snake. That's what makes Parselmouths special; a regular person might be able to cast magic or speak to another person using Parseltongue, but they can barely speak to snakes and they can't understand them at all. That's where the inherently-magical portion comes into play.
