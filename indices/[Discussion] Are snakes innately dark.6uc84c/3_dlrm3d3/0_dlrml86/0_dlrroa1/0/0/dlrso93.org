A worthy opinion --- as I said in my above message, the idea of Parseltongue /making/ the target snakes sentient has its merits even if I don't share it. But your way of putting it is odd. If you agree that one can #1 learn to understand it, and #2, imitate the sounds, what would stop, in your headcanon, someone who had learned to do both from speaking to a snake?
