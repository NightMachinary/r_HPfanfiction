Ah, the eternal conundrum of the definition of Dark magic. Let's not get into that today, we'll be here for hours.

For a while I've held the idea that regular snakes are just animals that are capable of following very basic orders. Think of a dog that you didn't have to train. It can fetch, bite, heel, etc. Magical snakes are the ones with higher intelligence and actual personality.

My only problem with your idea is that snakes are far, far too numerous as pets for someone to miss witnessing their intelligence if they were all capable of such.
