The Boa Constrictor is a strange one, true. I do like the idea of feralesque snakes, as it would make sense that most of them would be quite content with just being snakes, even if they were capable of more. Look at human beings: A lot of us are happy to sit on our asses and pig out. Snakes are probably even more susceptible due to not being able to do anything even if they were inclined to. So the majority is happy to do snake things, but some 5% has the drive to learn and grow their intelligence.
