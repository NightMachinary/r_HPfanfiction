As I said, your idea makes sense even if I don't share it. (Though how do you explain the Boa Constrictor in /Philosopher's Stone/? That one wasn't a magical snake and yet it clearly had 'higher intelligence', since it understood what its 'Born in Captivity' plaque meant and could form the abstract desire to travel to this place he'd never been on the faith that he was /supposed/ to live there.)

Something I may have made clearer is that because they have no society or even basic child-rearing for the most part, non-magical snakes are often quite stupid. Not unintelligent like an animal, but... stupid. Like feral children, pretty much. Pet snakes are probably in this scenario --- a mix of that and "The humans would freak out and probably stop feeding me if I proved myself clever enough to be a threat to them, better to lay low", /Toy Story/-style masquerade.
