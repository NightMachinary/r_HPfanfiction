First off, it's highly debatable whether "Dark magic" as an actual, physical concept is canon. Many would argue that a lot of what is classified as "Dark magic" is not /essentially/ different from the cutting charm you use to cook. Not the "Dark Magic can be used for good, it's the wizard that wields it" argument, not exactly --- more the argument that while there's no peaceful use for a guillotine, it's made with the same wood and metal as a wheelbarrow, not of some shadowy "inherently evil" substance.

Now next off, your three examples are not of /real/ snakes vanishing in smoke, but Conjured snakes --- magical constructs that were never alive. That they vanish so is likely because the spells in question are Dark magic themselves, not because of snakes' inherent nature but because they were invented by Dark Wizards. (The only gray area is the first one, the /Serpensortia/ one, as some interpret the spell as summoning a nearby snake rather than conjuring one, but then there's the possibility that Snape's spell actually teleported away again rather than destroying it.)

Now that we've cleared up canon on this point... on to my headcanon. My belief is that snakes are, in fact, quite sentient, much like goblins or veela. This is because they are naturally born with a magical ability that, instead of allowing them to work spells, increases their brain functions. However, because their biology was totally unprepared for this, snakes still have a lonely, family-less lifestyle that is not conductive to them forming a civlization (or developping a clear moral sense; it is not impossible, but it is rare). (The whole "snakes are dumb animals" belief of the Muggles is part of the Statute of Secrecy; because of the dark magic connection --- see next paragraph --- no wizards had ties to them anyway, but they realized that muggle scientists would start asking questions if the creatures' IQ was wildly off the map compared to their apparent brain capacity).

An entire race of opportunistic, sneaky assassins only you can understand was every Dark Wizard's dream, so early baduns like Herpo the Foul developped the Parselmouth curse to allow them and their offspring to naturally understand, and influence, their new minions. Since they had unlimited supplies of obedient snakes on hand, they also developped all sorts of Dark rituals involving them --- they were the perfect guinea pigs, expendable (as their brethren would not betray you over their loss) but also able to report about the experiment if it did not kill them.

Now keep in mind, all of this is merely speculation. Others have theorized that /speaking Parseltongue/ automatically grants the target heightened intelligence, and the idea has its merits (it is best showcased in linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone)), but I simply find the idea of naturally sapient but stone-age-level serpents much more interesting.
