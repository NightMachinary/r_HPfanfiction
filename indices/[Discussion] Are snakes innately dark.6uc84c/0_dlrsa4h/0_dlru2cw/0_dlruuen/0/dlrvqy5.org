I think we have a completely different view of HP magic. We see in canon that magic can be applied to pretty much anything. Words, job positions, places and concepts and traits (the Sword of Gryffindor - bravery). This means that even different pieces of magic used towards immoral use can belong to another branch. Because they follow the concept of "ill use".

This is what Voldemort says in regards to the potion:

#+begin_quote
  "it is an old piece of Dark Magic, the potion that revived me tonight"
#+end_quote

Yes, it is a potion, but it is also dark magic.

Also, remember this back and forth in HBP:

#+begin_quote
  "Certainly," said Voldemort, and his eyes seemed to burn red. "I have experimented; I have pushed the boundaries of magic further, perhaps, than they have ever been pushed -"

  "Of some kinds of magic," Dumbledore corrected him quietly. "Of some. Of others, you remain... forgive me... woefully ignorant."

  For the first time, Voldemort smiled. It was a taut leer, an evil thing, more threatening than a look of rage.

  "The old argument," he said softly. "But nothing I have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic, Dumbledore."

Voldemort and Dumbledore talk about the Dark Arts as an entire branch of magic here.
