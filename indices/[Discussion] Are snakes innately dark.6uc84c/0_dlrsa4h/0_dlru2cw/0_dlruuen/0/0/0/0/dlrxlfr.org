Well if we're going abstract, my idea is that Dark magic can be any branch of magic, but must be designed and created with cruelty in mind. The bloodboiling curse is a cruel mockery of a spell that was invented to combat hypothermia. The Entrails Expelling Curse is, according to the wiki, originally supposed to expel blockages from your intestines. But with cruelty in mind, it now expels the intestines themselves.

The one subject Dark magic has in common is Pain, Suffering, and Cruelty. That's what makes it Dark. That's why Voldemort is capable of pushing the boundaries of Dark Magic; He's a sadistic psychopath, and it comes naturally to him.
