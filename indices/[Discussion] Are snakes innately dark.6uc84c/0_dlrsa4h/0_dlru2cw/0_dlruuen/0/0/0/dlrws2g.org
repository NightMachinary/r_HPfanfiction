The issue is that we have two different views on the theory, the /nature/ of HP magic. Especially when it comes to spell creation and such, I see it as more /abstract/ (kinda).

On this note, I don't think we'll be able to agree on anything seeing as our notions of magic are different. It's like getting Voldemort and Dumbledore to see eye to eye.
