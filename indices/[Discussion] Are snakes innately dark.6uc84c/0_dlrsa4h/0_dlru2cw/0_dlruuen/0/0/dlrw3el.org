I suppose we are not talking about the same thing when we say "branch". I was talking about the /theory/ behind the magic --- how it /works/. Under this definition, in my headcanon, Dark Magic simply isn't a thing; there's no "scientific" [I'd say Arithmantic, but I'd mean White Squirrel-style Arithmancy, not the divination method Rowling later said it was] trait that defines magic as Dark. Meanwhile, the magical phenomenons at work behind Transfiguration, Charms, Divination and Potions are /objectively/ different, and so they are Branches under this system.

However, there is a less rigorous classification of magic in place, a more practical one for (if you'll forgive the phrase) "everyday use". This one classifies magic not by its nature but by its effects, thought of in human terms. To go back to my "objects" metaphor, this is the same way one can speak of "weapons" as a general category of objects even though, to a scientist's eye, there's nothing objectively in common between the constitution of a hand-grenade and a longbow. A physicist would point and laugh at someone classifying the elements this way, but two master craftsmen would discuss the concept of weapons as a very real thing.
