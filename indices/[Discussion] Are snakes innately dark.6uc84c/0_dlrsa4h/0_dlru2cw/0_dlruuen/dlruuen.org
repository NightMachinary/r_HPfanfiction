That is indeed what I am saying. The Unforgivables (and Horcrux-making) are Soul Magic, of which the Patronus is another, widely different part. Snape's Ever-Cutting Curse is more related to Healing that anything else, relying on the same basic knowledge but used for the malicious intent of /preventing/ healing rather than the other way around. Voldemort's rebirth ritual was some sort of freak Potions/Transfiguration/Healing hybrid (I'm not exactly sure). And so on.
