What find strange is that there seems to be a complete disregard for the historical association between snakes and healing. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_of_Asclepius][The Rod of Asclepius]] is just one such example. Combined with favorable views of serpents in many cultures outside Europe, I'm inclined to believe that the British magicals' opinion of snakes and parselmouths has been strongly colored by their association with Slytherin and more recently Voldemort rather than any inherent dark nature.
