The Pureblood Pretense does do some things with Polyjuice, but it's not really a big focus. Female!Harry uses it to disguise herself as her cousin to attend Hogwarts, and she modifies it to last for months at a time. She later makes another modification to it so that it does a fusion between the features of two people.
