Polyjuice, Imperius Curse and a Time Turner. Oh did someone you care about just die? Banish the corpse, go back 6 hours, stun whoever died and steal their hair, use Imperio on a random asshat from Knockturn Alley to make them act like the other guy and drink Polyjuice discreetly. Here you go, the person you cared about didn't die! It was that random guy from Knockturn Alley. Too bad someone banished the corpse before the effects of Polyjuice ran off, no one will even find the corpse.
