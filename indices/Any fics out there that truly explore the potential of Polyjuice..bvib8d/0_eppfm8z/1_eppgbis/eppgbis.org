Let's take a look at just a couple canon examples. It was used to fake Barty Crouch JR's death. It allowed him to stay close to Dumbledore for an entire year. It allowed Harry, and Ron to "infiltrate the enemy." There is so much you could use it for, from spying to faking you death, and all sorts of stuff in between.
