Death faking is more iffy - you cant leave a body, and I imagine divination is a thing more developed than trelawney teaches. Where tf is scrying, magically created eyes and the spell version of extended ears? Soo much shit that makes sense but trelawney doesmt teach it, meaning she's probably just not FORMALLY taught divination, but a self-taught seer.

P.s. i realise that in canon, tea leaf reading and the like may be legitimate divination techniques, but we dont really see her teach anything else.
