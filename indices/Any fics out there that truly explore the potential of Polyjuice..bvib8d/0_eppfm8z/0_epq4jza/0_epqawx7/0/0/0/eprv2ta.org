I feel like that's where a lot of realism finally comes in. Let's take for example working with pcs. Most of us are only proficient enough but not really wizards with it. Some people can do stuff with excel for example that would blow your.mind and save hours off of your work week with certain codes etc.

And it's the same in the Canon books. Some people just don't do the extra mile to do or learn stuff.
