I love, love, love Fangirl. Not because of the fandom aspect (though it was nice to see that represented in a book), but because Cath was so relatable and the coming-of-age story was realistic. People have said that this isn't a book ABOUT fanfiction, it's a book about a girl who just happens to write fanfiction. And I think that's true. It's a novel about growing up and changing and losing your old hobbies and finding connections with people they wouldn't expect. So if you're reading this book because of the Harry Potter (okay, "Simon Snow") aspect, you'll probably be disappointed. But it's a great contemporary read.

I was annoyed by the random fanfiction excerpts, though. It felt like the author just inserted them in there to fill up space. There's no reason we need to see so much of the fanfiction if it doesn't serve a purpose.

On a slight tangent, I can't help but imagine Emma Watson as the twins because she can play both the nerdy type and the glamorous, popular-girl type.
