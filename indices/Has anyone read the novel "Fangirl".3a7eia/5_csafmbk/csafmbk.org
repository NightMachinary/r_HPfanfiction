I really enjoyed it. I feel like it's popular right now to have a geek girl be the main character in YA, but this book hit home more than most because it actually felt the most like my experience in high school/college. I'm not a huge geek, but I'm a massive fangirl and it was refreshing to see fangirls written about as people who have lives outside of fandom as well as wonderful and meaningful friendships within fandom.

10/10 would read again.
