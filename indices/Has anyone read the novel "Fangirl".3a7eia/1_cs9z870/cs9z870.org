I loved the book. It explores something we as fans all must face, and probably have faced, by accepting life outside of fandom. It's easy when we're younger to embrace and fill our lives with the fandom we love but as we get older it fades away (though never completely) to make room for adulthood and we also have to accept that those around us lose touch with that world too.

It was a great read and I found it incredibly relatable as its a challenge I've found my own life, finding balance between fiction and the real world. As a con, I didn't care for the men she encounters as love interests, but they were realistic which is probably why (no man is perfect and they're all capable of being clueless dicks sometimes). No sugar coating there.

Two thumbs up!
