I would mostly recommend it, but I found it extremely frustrating that one of the main plot points was completely dropped at the end - which was so bizarre, like, the author spent so much time writing about it and then just forgot to tell us what happened?

But other than that, I thought it did a really good job of capturing the fandom experience. I could definitely relate to the protagonist.
