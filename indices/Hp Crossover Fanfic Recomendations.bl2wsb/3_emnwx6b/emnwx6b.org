I'm pretty sure I've made like 4 massive comments just for this... Whatever, I can do it a 5th time!

linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) and it's sequels are HP/The Dresden Files xovers, and have some of the best fight scenes I've ever read.

linkffn(Swords and Sorcery: No Route Back) and its sequel is a FSN/HP crossover where the main char of Fate/sn ends up in Hogwarts, Fem!Harry.

linkffn(Itachi, Is That A Baby) is one of my favorite crackfics, and has Harry raised by the Akatsuki from Naruto. good times.

linkffn(Invincible by Kathryn518) looks like it could be going places, but it's a Kathryn fic, so expect very slow updates.

haven't seen anyone rec linkffn(Heroes Assemble by Stargon1) linkffn(Wand and Shield by Morta's Priest) yet in this thread, and both are pretty good HP/MCU crossovers, though Heroes Assemble can get a bit boring.

linkffn(The Queen Who Fell to Earth) and its sequels are HP/Dragonriders of Pern crossovers where Harry reawakens the sentience of dragons in the first task of GoF.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20)

linkffn(FILFy Teacher; Magic of the Force; A Third Path to the Future) all good crossovers by Vimesenthusiast.

linkffn(Strength of Brothers; Have Fox, Will Travel) both Naruto crossovers.

linkffn(Mystic Knight Online) Sword Art Online crossover where Harry is kidnapped by Lucius Malloy and sent to Japan where he ends up inside SAO.

linkffn(Discordant by Heather Sinclair; In All Things Balance; The Boy Who Fell, A HP Starwars Crossover; I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For) SW fics.
