  The Orphanage couldn't find a space in their hearts between fear and pity for the boy. Merlin couldn't stand by and watch him fall. It's the 1930s, and Tom Riddles rise to power is set in motion with very different beginnings. Ghosts of Merlins guilt spur him into the path of a boy who so many had written off for darkness, but perhaps he can still be pulled from the depths.
