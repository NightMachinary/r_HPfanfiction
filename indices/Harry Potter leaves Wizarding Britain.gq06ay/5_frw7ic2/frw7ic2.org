A Second Chance at Life, and the sequel, Changes in a Time of War . The third part of the trilogy is A Magical World, but it only has two chapters and will probably never be finished.

Harry leaves Britain after sixth year, enrolls in a new school in America in order to be better prepared to fight Voldemort. This trilogy has a bit of everything, great world building and an interesting expansion of the magic system.

Harry is a bit OOC but this is my favourite take on the Harry goes to another school trope.
