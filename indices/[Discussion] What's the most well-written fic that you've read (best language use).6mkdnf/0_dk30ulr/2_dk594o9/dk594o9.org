  The other is the thesaurus writer. We all know this person. They are the type of people to take a sentence like this: The green cat ran away from the fast car. and turn it into this: The virescent feline skedaddled away from the rapidly forthcoming automobile. It's just jarring and reeks of auteurism.

  Swimdraconian: Hands down the best writer in the fandom. His prose is beautiful and minimalistic at the same time. He uses just enough to get is message across. If you haven't read his story DO IT. DO IT NOW.
