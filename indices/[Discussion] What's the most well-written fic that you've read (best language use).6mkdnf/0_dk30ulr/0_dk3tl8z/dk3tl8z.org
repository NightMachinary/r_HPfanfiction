I definitely agree with you on the grammar; I should have written it as good /use/ of grammar, because you're absolutely right that sometimes bad grammar enriches the story (usually in dialogue).

And spelling is where my main problem lies. To be honest, like I said, a few errors don't bother me, but when the author appears to write a story and hand it to the reader, /accipe hoc/, seemingly without a single reread or beta, then I get annoyed. I can understand missed mistakes, but if you misspell a word four times in a row in four different ways, would it be amiss to open a dictionary, hundreds of which are available at your fingertips on the very device you're probably writing the story on?

Where token writers are concerned, I definitely have noticed a few of those, and their style unfortunately suffers for it. New words are good, but moderation is key. I have found myself almost falling to the temptation of doing this once in a while. It isn't pretty.

Personally, I haven't been a very good English student, unfortunately, but I'd like to think I've read enough well-written books that I can appreciate good prose. It's a little vain, but when confronted worth a poorly- written story, I find myself wanting to fix it.

Thanks for the quite comprehensive answer! (I'll admit this was mostly an excuse to rant.) Thank you also for the recs!
