yeah i cannot come up with any prose stylists in hpfanfiction. the closest might be joe, although it strays into purple territory.

for my money the best top to bottom grammar and diction is in hpmor. the characters sound like they should, which is very important -- harry shouldn't use the same diction as dumbledore, etc.

with that said, you're right, there are quite a few authors who have essentially perfect grammar. the life and times, stages of hope, everything by newcomb and enembee as suggested above.
