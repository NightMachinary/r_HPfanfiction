There are plenty of authors who write functionally and edit their work. I have a hard time thinking of any who have /great/ prose.

linkffn(Proud by Summer Leigh Wind) probably has the best writing in a long-form fic I can think of.

The prose in linkffn(Cauterize) is a bit cheesy, but works well.

The latest chapters of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chrysalis) have been excellently written, especially the dialogue (in earlier chapters, the characters tend to monologue).
