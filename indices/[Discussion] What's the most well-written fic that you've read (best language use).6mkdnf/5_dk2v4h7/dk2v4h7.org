I've always really liked AJ Hall's fic writing, though the long works are not to everybody's taste (being Neville/Draco and, IMHO, OOC with regards to both). 'The Mark of the Beast' is a Remus 1st POV, one shot, PG-13/R, set shortly after Voldemort's first fall, dealing with the treatment of werewolves. Eminently readable.
