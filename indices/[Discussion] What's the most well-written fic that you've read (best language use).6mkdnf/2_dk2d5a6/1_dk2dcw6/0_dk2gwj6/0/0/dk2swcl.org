My favourite part honestly is the Lupin and Billy-trucks dynamic. Or Sassy Fawks. Midget detentions. The Obliviation game. The after-dark mark. Lovus Shieldus. Flailing magical umbilicals (ok that made me sad).

If you enjoyed that I suggest "Gryffindors Never Die". It's Harry and Rons time travelling bromance and perfect in every way. Lord love a goat.
