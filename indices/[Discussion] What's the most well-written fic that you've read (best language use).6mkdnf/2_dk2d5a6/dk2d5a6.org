Nonjon, Newcomb, Enembee, Chem Prof, JBern, Matt Silver, White Squirrel.

There are tons of authors that are excellent at the technical aspects of writing and editing even if their plots are not appealing to certain readers. Even Robst, for as much shit as we gice him for his overdone and cringey plots, never has any noticeable editing errors. Usually threads like these come down to "what is your favorite fic?" So in no particular order:

1. Cauterize by Lady Altair
2. A Black Comedy by Nonjon
3. Browncoat, Green Eyes by Nonjon
4. Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma by The Matt Silver
5. The Arithmancer by White Squirrel
