  Thanks. If you're still up to that (please don't feel obligated), I'll leave a link here. I decided to instead go for an original character for their son, though, and he only appears as a newborn. It's a one-shot dealing with the mother's grief of letting her child go during war times, but I'm thinking of expanding it to an actual series. Following who, I don't know yet.
