It's all good. I was excepting, if not nothing, then a canon character such as Bellatrix. Frankly, I don't think my idea or search is all that popular if the downvotes are anything to go by.

Eh, oh well. I'm just going to continue working on my WIP; I'm starting to like this character I'm creating. She's already a lot of fun to write, though I'm debating on just creating a new character instead of using Harry. That means I'd need to use a different secret adopted family. Perhaps one that's not even in the know themselves.

Thank you for your recommendation. I'll check it out.
