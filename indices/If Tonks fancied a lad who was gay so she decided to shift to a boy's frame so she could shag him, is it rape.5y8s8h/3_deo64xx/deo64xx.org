I had written a fairly long diatribe about it but I manage to make it disappear somehow (actually no idea how) so I'll sum it up with my final bits:

The law in the real world, especially where it applies to disclosing gender, medical history, and prior relationships, as well as impersonation and their intent, is very complicated and only looked at on a case by case basis. In the real world, the vast majority of cases you hear about where a transgender person was deceiving a partner about their gender is when they've been assaulted or murdered. By vast majority, I mean an hour of looking into it has revealed thousands of "someone I know" from open and violent transphobes and exactly one real legal case and the person involved verbally lied directly to their partner about it.

To me, if you're going out to hook up with someone for the night, you've given up the right to care about their history and accepted the risks of STDs or their other prior medical health.

I imagine that due to the multitude of ways one could hid their identity or coerce another person into sex, as well as the fact that the legal system in the HP world is incredibly fucked up, at most it would be rape only if magic was used on the other person. Similarly, using magic on yourself to bed a non-magical would be muggle-baiting at best.
