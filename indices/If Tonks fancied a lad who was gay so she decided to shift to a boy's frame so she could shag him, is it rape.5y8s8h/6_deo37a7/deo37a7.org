Not really, unless she changed mid-coitus or something.

I mean, the basic requirement of your question's very possibility is for metamorphmagi to be able to actually change their sex rather than just their appearance (because Tonks isn't stupid enough to try if that weren't the case). As such, for Tonks a female form is preferred as this is the form she is usually in, but she would also have an actual male form that is 100% male, thus making into something that body-wise is both a man and a woman, just not both at once.

As such, if the guy actually liked Tonks's personality enough to take her to bed, be it as a man or as a woman, this means he would like Tonks as a person rather than a man or a woman, and if Tonks's body was male at the moment she would count as a genuine man, just one with the ability to turn into a woman.

Supernatural abilities make some nuances of law go weird.
