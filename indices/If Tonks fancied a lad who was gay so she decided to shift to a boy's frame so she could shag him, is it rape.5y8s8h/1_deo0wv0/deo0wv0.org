I would argue that as a metamorph her sex and gender aren't exactly fixtures. Its debatable if she is "actually" a woman or just by choice and at some point probably habit. Obviously that always depends on how you write metamorphs.

As an answer to the question I would say no, it isn't rape. Tonks doesn't drop him love potion or charms him somehow, she only works her body to fit his preference. If he consents then, its not rape - just a shitty thing to do, I'd say.
