I'm gonna bypass the whole real-world legal question, since the wizarding world is not anything like it.

The situation would be considered a prank. These folk think love potions are quaint and harmless. Making kids test out transfigurative snacks without any warning as to what might happen is considered 'a bit irresponsible, but at least they're paid for it'.

If they had sex and neither was physically injured by it, there's nothing for it. In fact, they'd probably see it as ridiculous if one of them was injured by it but was healed afterwards.

"You're upset by it? Well, tosh dearie. Just have a friend Obliviate you about it and you'll be right as rain. I'll make you some tea."
