I agree that this particular scenario is greatly open to interpretation, and what I immediately leapt to in my head was more dramatic/malicious. I think what I was thinking of was closer to the case of the person pretending to be their brother.

But actually here I was simply clarifying to Quoba that lying to trick someone into having sex with you can be regarded as rape. Particularly his claim that saying you will pay someone and then not - that is absolutely regarded as rape here it just rarely results in a prosecution.
