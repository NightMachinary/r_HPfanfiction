Quoba said 'they wold give you a lot of money' which goes beuond simply saying 'I'm rich'; I am well aware that history is littered with women who have been duped by promises of marriage and suggestions that the partner is wealthy. But there have been cases in the UK of sex workers taking people to court who have refused to pay - it does not come under theft but sexual assault, as payment was a condition of consent.

I'm not debating the right or wrong of these cases. I am saying that there are cases where people have been prosecuted. My thinking of the Tonks scenario is not a hook up, but if she knew someone was gay and used her powers to actively deceive him, without his knowledge or consent, into believing that she was someone else.
