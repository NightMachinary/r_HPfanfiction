Quodba was saying that claiming to be something you're not (like rich or unmarried) is considered expected human behavior and not something that rises to the type of egregious betrayal necessary to be considered rape by deception.

Frankly, I think the Israeli case law in the Wikipedia articles go too far by saying that a man claiming to be a neurosurgeon deception was severe enough to be considered rape by deception. I don't think that simply verbally lying about your identity should be enough; in someone has sex without attempting to verify the information, its not rape by deception. If, however, someone creates false evidence (a fake professional persona online) or has their friends lie, then yes, its a serious enough crime of fraud to invalidate consent.

Like if person A doesn't ask person B if they're clean (disease free) before having unprotected sex, they can't claim that was really a necessary condition to their consent. Person A had to at least try to check that information.
