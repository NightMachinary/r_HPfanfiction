Yes, I read the articles, but still don't think that this hypothetical situation involving Tonks would count as rape by deception.

Even in the most similar case of rape by deception, where a woman prepared to be a man, one of the articles said: "The prosecution said that 'at no time' did the woman consent to sex with the use of a prosthetic and in so doing, 'the defendant sexually assaulted' her."

The key to the rape by deception laws is that the person wouldn't have consented otherwise. I think that if Tonks went to a gay club and attracted her crush by changing her body to be male, no one would consider her crushes delicate sensibilities as invalidated general consent. Things would be murkier if she assumed a persona to deceptively entice the person into a relationship, but a one night stand? Nah, I can't see that being considered rape.
