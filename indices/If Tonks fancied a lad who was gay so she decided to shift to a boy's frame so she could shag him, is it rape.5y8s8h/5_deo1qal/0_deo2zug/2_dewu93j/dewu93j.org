I don't think using a legal definition to decide a moral issue is the right way to go. Aside from being a fictional universe, where there's some rather shitty laws, legality and morality don't necessarily go hand in hand. Being legal doesn't mean that something's moral, nor does being illegal imply that something is immoral.

In any case, I'd say that calling something "rape" needs to be confined to specific cases where someone's consent was seriously violated. Calling someone who changes their appearance to get sex a rapist is treading on some really shaky ground. At which point do you draw that line? Is makeup OK? What about dressing in drag? What about having plastic surgery to look more desirable? Why are those things necessarily different from a magic user morphing into a different form?
