Not a deformity, just an unexplored magical ability that routes their magic differently. Squibs are unable to create magic, but they are capable of channelling it, creating what we refer to as Magicians. They can be just as powerful as wizards, but their training is a bit more intensive. Surprisingly, there are more Magicians in history rather than Wizards, it's only recently that the Wizarding populace started out weighing the magician populace. So there are schools specifically for these people (although considerably less than Wizards), and they have prominent communities of their own.
