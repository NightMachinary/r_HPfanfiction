I believe Rowling said it was canon or something. I'm in agreement though that in the hierarchy of canon it's very, very low down. So low down that it's practically buried six feet down. However, it seemed to make the most sense as a reason to question what happens to the trolley lady (in the Cursed Child she turns out to have been on the train since it was first stolen from the Muggles and has knives for fingernails or something of the sort).
