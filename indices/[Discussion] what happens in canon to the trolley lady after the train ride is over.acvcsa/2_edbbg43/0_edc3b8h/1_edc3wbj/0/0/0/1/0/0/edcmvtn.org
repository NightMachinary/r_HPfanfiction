That's ... wow. I do understand treating the Pottermore stuff as canon at least to a degree because some of it actually doesn't contradict anything and can be fun to play with, and I always knew that Cursed Child is a wretched work that doesn't really qualify as canon unless you gouge out your eyes and only then take a look at it, but adding such a pointless thing for ... I can't even think of a reason, just highlights how much of a nonsense it is.

That said, it's not like I could have seen the stage play so I can't judge it based on the entertainment value of the play proper.
