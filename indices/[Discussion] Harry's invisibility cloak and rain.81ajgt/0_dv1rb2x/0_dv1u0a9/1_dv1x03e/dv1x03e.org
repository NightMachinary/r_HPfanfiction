I was always under the impression that Mood couldn't see through the cloak, but that he, one, knew from Dumbledore Harry had the cloak, and two, there were other things that tipped him off to Harry being there.

Like when Harry dropped the golden egg, his foot was stuck in the trick stair, Moody couldn't see Harry, but could see through the stairs and just the part of his leg stuck in it, and put two and two together.

Then in the pub, didn't Ron or Hermione hand Harry a butterbeer under the table, either Harry's hand was momentarily visible, or again Moody made an educated guess when the butterbeer disappeared.
