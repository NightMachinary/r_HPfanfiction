Best theory I've read for that was elder wand-related shennanigans. Moody's eye seems to be unique - even people who would have a vested interest in being able to see through walls can't, and we know he's buddy-buddy with Dumbledore. So the potential is there that the eye was made using the elder wand.

Or it could just be that Moody is paranoid enough to spot the cloak even through the hole in his vision and Dumbledore seems like the type that would know his mind well enough to notice when it was playing silly buggers with him.
