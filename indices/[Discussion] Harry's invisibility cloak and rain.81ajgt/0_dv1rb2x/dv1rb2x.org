Assuming there's something to the whole Deathly Hallows thing rather than it just being an exceptionally made invisibility artifact, I'd say that Harry's invisibility cloak is less "invisibility" and more "hole in visual perception." As such, the observers brain would paper over any inconsistencies with rain or flour or whatever and still completely fail to see that someone was wearing the cloak.

Think of it like the holes in your vision where your optic nerves connect to your eyes. If you hit it at juuuust the right angle and you're looking for it, you might notice something, but for the most part your brain just nopes it out of existence.

But for regular invisibility cloaks? The ones made from demiguse hair or are just basically regular cloaks with disillusionment charms on them? Sure, if you're paying attention or its raining particularly hard, it should be pretty obvious someone is there.
