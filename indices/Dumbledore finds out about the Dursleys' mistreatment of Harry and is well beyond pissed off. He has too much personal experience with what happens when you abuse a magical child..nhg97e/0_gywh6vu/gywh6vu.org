What SHOULD have happened. Yes.

Raise him at Hogwarts, he can stay at the Gryffindor Tower during the Summer Holidays, and meet Professor Dumbledore for meals and other ways.

Or: Have Dumbledore find someone suitable to raise him. He can ask Andromeda and Ted, he can ask Kingsley, Nymphadora Tonks, he can ask Bill since Bill would be of age to take Harry at this point and time, (well, depending on when Albus finds out).

The Ministry wouldn't let Remus take Harry in, BUT! There are other people who would take him.

Heck, I could see even the Weasley's being able to move away from their home, if that meant that Harry was somewhere safe and where the bad guys couldn't find him.

Heck! Albus could beg Abeforth to take Harry. Albus could ask Poppy to take in Harry, etc.

There ARE options. Again, depending on how old Harry is when Albus finds out, and how old Bill is and when he trains for cursebreaking, he can protect the houses from potential invaders.

Dumbledore himself, could protect the house from potential invaders.

Heck! Have others assume Harry is still staying at the Dursley's, let Harry make a few remarks about being upset about going back, so anyone who overhears thinks he's at the Dursley's, and then he ends up somewhere else instead . SO many options that Dumbledore could have done but simply didn't, just because the protection spells protected Harry from the Death Eaters, didn't mean that they protect him from the Dursley's. While he isn't as abused as Fanon likes to portray

He was abused! No matter what others say, he was.

They put under the cupboard under the stairs, when the Dursley's had two other bedrooms. Fed him just enough food to keep him alive (The Weasley's ended up giving Harry food during the Summer)

Harry seemed to know to stay away from Vernon's fist, when Harry was listening to the news outside, under the window.

Didn't buy him new clothes. Didn't even buy him his own hand me down clothes that would fit him better, but instead gave him Dursley's old hand me down clothes that were way too big.

Harry ducked with seemingly a lot of practice, when Petunia threw a pan at his head. There were no photos of Harry throughout the house. Harry didn't get presents from the Dursley's, but Dudley was spoiled.

The Dursley's put a freaking cat flap, lock on his door, and bars on his freaking window! like he was a prisoner instead of a family member. If you don't consider that abuse/neglect, you need to rethink that.

Sorry for the long rant. I just HATE when people say Harry wasn't abused or neglected. He was. Not to the extent that Fanon likes to say, but he was.
