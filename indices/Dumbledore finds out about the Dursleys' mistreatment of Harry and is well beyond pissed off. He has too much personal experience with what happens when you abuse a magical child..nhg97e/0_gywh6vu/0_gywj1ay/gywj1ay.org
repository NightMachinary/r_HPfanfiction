Yup. And even fanon has some resemblance of truth. Rowling has said that the physical abuse was a lot worse originally, but her editor made her remove it. There are still hints there that suggest physical abuse is happening. I figure he was physically abused, myself.

Just not to the 'huge scarring, whipped with a belt covered with rat poison' extent some extreme fanfics do.
