Well. Physical abuse. Like I said, the neglect and emotional abuse were, wow. We only really see it with Harry's distrust for authority figures and the way he literally seems to only have two friends till book five, and even after that, Neville and Luna are distant and Ginny is shoehorned into a love interest. (Note: I like Ginny romances well enough, but Rowling wrote it badly.)
