For me, it being played as a joke was a brilliant indication of magical society as a whole- it indicates they'd rather have a dead child than a Squib child. Not only this, but even if not everyone would do actually try and kill their Squib child, nobody condemned the action.

Unfortunately JKR did not try and imply that whatsoever and fully did play it off as a joke. I love to see fanfics where Muggleborns have a “woah what the fuck” kind of reaction and it gets addressed later on.
