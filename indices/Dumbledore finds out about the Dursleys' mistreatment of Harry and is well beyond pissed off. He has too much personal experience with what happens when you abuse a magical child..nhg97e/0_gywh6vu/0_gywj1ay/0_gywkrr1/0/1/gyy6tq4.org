I'm not surprised. Rowling is deficient in many ways, and her understanding of psychology is clearly one of them. ðŸ˜…

Also, consider how she treated what happened to Neville with his family. It was played as a joke!

I agree, the abuse was probably worse than the books show but not as bad as the more horrific fics that make me worry about the writers. It makes the most sense to have it in the middle, and have Harry have to deal with that.
