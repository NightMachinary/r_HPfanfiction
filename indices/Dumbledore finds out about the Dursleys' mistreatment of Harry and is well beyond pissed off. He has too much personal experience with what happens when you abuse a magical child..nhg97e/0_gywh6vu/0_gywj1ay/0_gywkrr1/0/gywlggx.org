Yup.

I figure he was hit a lot. Shook like a ragdoll (this actually happens once in the books, it's just glossed over). And so on. I wouldn't be surprised if, if he broke a bone, they didn't take him to a hospital for a while to punish him, that sort of pettiness fits Vernon and Petunia.

But even moreso, they neglected him and MASSIVELY emotionally abused him to the point where I'm surprised Rowling depicts him as well-adjusted as he is, and I can see major signs of badness in spite of that.
