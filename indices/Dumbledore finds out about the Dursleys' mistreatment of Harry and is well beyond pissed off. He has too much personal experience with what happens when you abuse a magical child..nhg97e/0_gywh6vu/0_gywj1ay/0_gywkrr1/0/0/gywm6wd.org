I figure he did some accidental magic, which scared Vernon enough not to mess with him any more.

Harry definitely shows signs of not trusting adults. He doesn't tell Dumbledore about writing in the diary, he tells McGonagall about the stone, but when she doesn't do anything, he learns to do things for himself. Which probably validates that adults just don't care what happens to kids.

He probably told little tidbits about the Dursley's "off screen" so to speak, to Ron and Hermione, I don't see someone like Hermione letting go the fact that Harry doesn't buy the Dursley's presents for Christmas, for example. So I can see him telling them a few things, but I bet you anything, he has kept them in the dark about a LOT of stuff.

Besides the fact that Rowling just wanted Harry to stay at the Dursley's, I like to think that Molly just assumed Fred and George were exaggerating in order to get out of trouble when they told her about the bars and door, otherwise I don't see her ignoring that information. Again, outside of Rowling wanting Harry to stay at the Dursley's for stupid petty drama that could have been avoided.

Heck! When Ron and Hermione couldn't write him proper letters because of the Order, they could have written him letters about other things instead, or coming up with a code or something, which again, just shows that Rowling just wanted some stupid drama when Harry met with Ron and Hermione again. Which, I totally understand why Harry got so mad at them for not telling him anything.
