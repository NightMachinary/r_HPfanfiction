Voldemort could have easily broken past any magical protection.

This was a protection he could not understand and hence could not overcome.

Even when he thought he beat it,(in GoF), he actuall gave Harry a ticket to life.

But-letting a child suffer through abuse-was not cool.

The out-of-universe explanation is that JKR wanted him to come from that sort of background. She didn't realize her poor planning would backfire on Dumbledore like this. She could have constructed a more genuine explanation for why he had to stay at the Dursleys, or better yet, shown us that no other protection was truly safe. Ie have Dumbledore try alternative arrangements but have them fail. The in-universe one-wizards don't have a lot of logic, not even great ones like Dumbledore? I mean, from the Sorcerer's Stone to a student dying in the castle to the Ministry's ridiculuous attitude in OoTP to the insane 7 Potters plan-yeah, they aren't very logical. Not to mention the way they approached the Horcrux Hunt. Not to sound too critical, but ignoring these slight lapses of logic and treating the series like a pseudo-fairytale will perhaps help. In some ways, the magic is the least normal thing in the Wizarding World.

But while almost every point you made was bang-on, I don't think he should have stayed at Hogwarts. Albus could not have defended Harry himself all the time and Harry was attacked by Voldy multiple times in the books in Hogwarts itself. With so many students to look after in a highly sentient magical castle next to a Forbidden Forest filled with dark creatures, the castle itself having a poltergeist-I mean Hogwarts itself is very unsafe.

But other thn that, you're right, he shouldn't have suffered like this.
