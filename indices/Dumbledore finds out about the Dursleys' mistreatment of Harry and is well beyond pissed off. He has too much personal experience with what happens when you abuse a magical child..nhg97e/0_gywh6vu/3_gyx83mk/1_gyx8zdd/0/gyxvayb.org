It's not like Hagrid ever showed up to see how they were treating Harry after he picked him up at the hut, and Sirius was a bit of an empty threat because they never met him. If Dumbledore - who they knew had some kind of power in the wizarding world as the headmaster and the person who placed Harry with them - went to their house, threatened them/negotiated with them, and then regularly checked up on Harry personally afterwards, I think they would have been more likely to change their treatment of him. Dumbledore couldn't make them love Harry and treat him like their own, but he could have made it more bearable for him.
