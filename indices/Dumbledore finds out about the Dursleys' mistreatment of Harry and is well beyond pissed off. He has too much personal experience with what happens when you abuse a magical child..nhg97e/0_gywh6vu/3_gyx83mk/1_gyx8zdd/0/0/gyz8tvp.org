I agree with you , and they already did change the treatment of Harry at least a little bit when the gave him his own room instead of a cupboard when he got his letter, they are afraid wizards where watching them, If the letter came years earlier of even if Dumbeldore mcgonagall or Hagrid popped in every so often Harry would have had his own room for years, all Dunbledore had to do was not abandon harry for 10 years and check on him.

Mcgonagall even said they were the worst sort of muggles and Dumbledore should know what the worst sort of muggles can be capable of considering his history with them and Ariana. Harry's life could of been made considerably more bearable and easier. But some people always try to to excuse Dumbldore's actions an in actions in regard to Harry.
