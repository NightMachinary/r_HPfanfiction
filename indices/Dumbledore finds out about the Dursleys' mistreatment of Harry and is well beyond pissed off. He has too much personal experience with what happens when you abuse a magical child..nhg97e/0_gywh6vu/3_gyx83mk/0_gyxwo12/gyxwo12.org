  Now people come out with a load of bullshit excuses and try and absolve Dumbledore of any wrong doing when he flat out tells the readers he was aware of it all.

He wasn't aware of it "all." He was aware Harry would have a dark and difficult time. This doesn't mean he knew Harry would live in the cupboard or whatever.

Dumbledore knew Harry would be neglected at the very least. But the alternative was with someone else who might be loyal to Voldemort and without the protection of the bond of blood charm.

Dumbledore makes it clear that Voldemort would have eventually bypassed any other enchantment, and the bond of blood charm was the only one Voldemort likely wouldn't be able to figure out. He had no idea when Voldemort would be back. He had no idea who he could trust.

The terror of Voldemort was that he turned family and best friends against each other. And to Dumbledore, that had been proven with Sirius Black.

So he had a choice. Risk leaving Harry with a follower of Voldemort and having him killed or tortured into insanity, or leave him in a likely abusive home where he would at least survive.

The criticism therefore should be aimed at whether he could have at least intervened in the Dursleys home. Could he have? Maybe. Or maybe trying it would have caused Petunia to kick Harry out.
