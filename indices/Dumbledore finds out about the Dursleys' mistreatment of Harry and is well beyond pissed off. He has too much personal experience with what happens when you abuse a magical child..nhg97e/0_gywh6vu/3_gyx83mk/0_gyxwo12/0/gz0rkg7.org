Vernon did try to kick Harry out once and might have been successful if Dumbledore hadn't intervened and reminded Petunia that their own safety from Voldemort and the wizarding world depended entirely on Harry being allowed to live there. If she hadn't gotten that reminder, do you really think she would have argued in favor of Harry's continued presence at #4?

That howler was proof that he didn't need to physically check on Harry to alert the Dursleys to the fact that he was watching them. Periodic reminders of that sort might have made living there more bearable for Harry growing up. Considering the Dursleys' obsession with appearances and reputation, I would think periodic reminders of that sort, rather than in-person visits, which allowed them to keep up the appearance of normality, would have kept Petunia from kicking Harry out and made Harry's life there more tolerable in the process.

The fact that Dumbledore left Harry there despite knowing it would be "dark and difficult" for him leads me to believe that Dumbledore either forgot or underestimated just how dark muggles could get with kids and thought McGonagall's description of the Dursleys as the "worst sort of muggles" was an exaggeration on her part. He gambled Harry's life and well-being, as well as the fate of wizarding Britain, on the assumption that nothing could be as bad as or worse than Harry ending up in the hands of death eaters/Voldemort. He got lucky.
