Yeah, for some reason people like to give Dumbledore a pass for being a complete peace of shit in regards to Harry's life even though he outright tells the readers he knows exactly what he was condemning Harry to. If Dumbledore wanted to stop the abuse and neglect he could have but he chose not to it makes his actions in regards to Harry quite monstrous.

Now people come out with a load of bullshit excuses and try and absolve Dumbledore of any wrong doing when he flat out tells the readers he was aware of it all.
