Maybe if Dumbledore actually spoke to Sirius once, the man who was a member of Dumbledore's very own order of the phoenix he would of gotten the truth, Instead Dumbledore was to busy saving Snape a known deatheater from azkaban when he couldn't do the same for Sirius.

If Dumbldore really thought Voldemort would return then surely he would want to speak to Sirius Black apparent right hand man of Voldemort and the man who apparently was spying on them for years and could have important information on the Dark Lord.
