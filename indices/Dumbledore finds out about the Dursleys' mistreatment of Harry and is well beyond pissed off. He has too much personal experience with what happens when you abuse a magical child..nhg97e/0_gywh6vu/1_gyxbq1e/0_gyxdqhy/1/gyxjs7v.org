  Maybe if Dumbledore actually spoke to Sirius once, the man who was a member of Dumbledore's very own order of the phoenix he would of gotten the truth, Instead Dumbledore was to busy saving Snape a known deatheater from azkaban when he couldn't do the same for Sirius.

I don't think it's ever really explained fully, but IIRC Sirius is taken directly to Azkaban by Crouch, and since Sirius seemingly admitted to the crime, it was like "welp, straight to jail with you!" They weren't letting any potential Death Eaters just walk away. Dumbledore /could/ have gone to bat for Sirius, but that's assuming Dumbledore knew the circumstances and believed Sirius' side.

This is also taking into account that Dumbledore, Sirius, and the supposedly dead Peter Pettigrew are the only ones who knew about the Fidelius. It isn't immediately public knowledge.

Snape went to Dumbledore first, which is why Dumbledore made him his spy. If Sirius had gone straight to Dumbledore instead of immediately going after Peter, things would probably be different.

Even if Dumbledore thinks Sirius is a Death Eater, Sirius could just lie. There's nothing really contingent on interrogating Death Eaters about Voldemort's plans and whereabouts when the man is probably crazy / delusional / distraught. Should he have followed up? Sure, but we only know this with hindsight.
