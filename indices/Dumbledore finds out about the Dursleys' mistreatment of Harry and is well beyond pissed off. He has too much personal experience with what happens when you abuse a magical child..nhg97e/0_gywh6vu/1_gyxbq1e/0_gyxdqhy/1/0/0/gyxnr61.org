True, but it's hard to line up the timelines here and still make things work in canon.

So:

1. Voldemort kills the potters.
2. Dumbledore doesn't immediately show up? So he assumes Harry is also dead. Does he meet up with the Longbottoms, assuming they're the next target? Assuming the Fidelius collapsed when the Potters died, this seems like the most likely scenario?
3. Hagrid shows up at some point.
4. Sirius shows up, loans Hagrid the motorcycle, runs off to kill Peter.
5. Hagrid meets up with Dumbledore and gives Harry off. He goes to a pub and gets drunk and blabs about Harry being the Boy Who Lived.
6. The Longbottoms get attacked anyway?
