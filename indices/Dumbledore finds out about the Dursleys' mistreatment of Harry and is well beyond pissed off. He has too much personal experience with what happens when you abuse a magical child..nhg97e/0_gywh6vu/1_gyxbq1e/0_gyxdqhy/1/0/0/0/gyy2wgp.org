The timeline of how Dumbledore knows that a) Harry is alive and that b) Harry should stay at the Dursleys because of Lily's blood protection has always been confusing for me. Based on the facts we know, it feels impossible for Dumbledore to have known enough about what happened to make those decisions as quickly as he did.
