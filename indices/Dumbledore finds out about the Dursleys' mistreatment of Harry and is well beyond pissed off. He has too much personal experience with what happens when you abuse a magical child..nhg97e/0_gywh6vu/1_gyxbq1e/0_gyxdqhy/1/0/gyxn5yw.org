Sirius went to Godric's Hollow first, looking for Harry (and presumably Lilly and James). Hagrid took Harry, on Dumbledore's orders if I recall correctly, rather than let Sirius have him. That's where Hagrid got the flying motorcycle he had in his first appearance.

It's a reasonable assumption that Sirius went after Peter because he did not have Harry to worry over/loon after.
