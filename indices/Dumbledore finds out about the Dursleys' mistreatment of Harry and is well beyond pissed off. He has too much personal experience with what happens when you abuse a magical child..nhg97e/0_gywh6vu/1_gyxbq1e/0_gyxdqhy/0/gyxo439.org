People get all so hung up on the whole Fidelius thing.

That wasn't the main reason why Sirius went to Azkaban - the reason were the thirteen murdered people. Even if Dumbledore believed out of the fullest of his heart that Sirius wasn't a Death Eater and wasn't responsible for the Potter's death he couldn't have helped him getting out of Azkaban - and at this point of time Dumbledore thought that Sirius actually betrayed the Potters and was a Death Eater because James and Lily told everyone that Sirius was the Secret Keeper - and Dumbledore didn't have any reason to believe that they lied about that.

But even that weren't the point. Say, Dumbledore doubted the Potters and knew that Sirius wouldn't betray them... he still couldn't have helped Sirius. Even the chief warlock can't ignore 13 murders. And to be honest, I believe that Dumbledore thought Sirius actually able to comit the murders. Sirius may have fought for the right side but his moral compass wasn't the best. He thought of sending another student to a werewolf as a prank.

And while there wasn't a trial, there was an investigation. Dumbledore said he stated in front of the Ministry that Sirius was the Potters Secret Keeper. And this investigation, while reading the evidence wrong, found Sirius guilty.

So there wasn't really a reason for Dumbledore to doubt Sirius fault and no reason to talk to him and defend him.
