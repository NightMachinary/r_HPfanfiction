"And while there wasn't a trial, there was an investigation. Dumbledore said he stated in front of the Ministry that Sirius was the Potters Secret Keeper. And this investigation, while reading the evidence wrong, found Sirius guilty."

Yeah, I'm going to have to step in right there and say that doesn't excuse the matter. Even Bellatrix got a damn trial. Sirius didn't and that is a breach of rights. It just goes to show that either A. Rowling didn't think, or B. It's part of her world that everyone in a position of power (including Dumbledore) is corrupt enough to ignore that fact. Because they could have done to him the same thing that the Ministry tried to do to Harry in Order of the Phoenix.
