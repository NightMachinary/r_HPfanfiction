I dunno, I think you're forgetting that Dumbledore couldn't really trust anyone. Sirius Black was apparently a Death Eater, James' own best friend. If even he couldn't be trusted, why would Dumbledore trust someone else?

I can only see himself or McGonagall, but they'd both be far too busy. And Dumbledore makes it explicitly clear in canon that he believed Voldemort would be able to bypass any other protection.

Dumbledore also didn't have the hindsight of knowing when Voldemort would come back. Putting Harry at the Dursleys was his way of making sure Harry didn't get tortured into insanity or killed.
