Why would he give him to strangers like the tonkses who WERENT even in the Order? How can he ask something like that of his acquaintances and put them in that position? Harry isn't special by any means, war left loads of orphans.

And hogwarts is better than dursleys, but ONLY in hindsight. Albus almost had no right interfering with the dursleys neglect which was until recently their right as guardians. He cant use his power to play god nor bully people into decency making them lash out to their own detriment.

You can't set an arbitrary bar below which if a guardian falls you ruinously plonk the kid in a new environment.

Bill as a young man should forego his future pledging himself to a stranger kid? Why would the weasleys take in a random orphan with actual relatives when there are tons of orphans? Altruism and a decent family doesn't mean commiting to literally every child in need.
