Petunia may have had dibs, but they never even asked her if she wanted to take him in the first place, just left him on her doorstep with a letter. Yes, she had to accept him for the protections to work, but what else are you going to do when there's a baby on your doorstep and you have no way to contact the people who put him there to say you don't want to take him in? She didn't really have a choice - Dumbledore made sure she had to accept him by leaving him there and not actually talking to her about it. That was very unethical.
