honestly why would dumbledore know that petunia hated magic? Lily certainly didn't come up to the headmaster to rant about sister problems, she would have gone to McGonagall if anyone, and McG wouldn't have shared because privacy. I think that leaving a child on a doorstep is SO STUPID(Whyyy did Rowling have to do things because plot) but from Dumbledore's perspective, giving Petunia Harry was the best thing - what else could he do? He couldn't foist off the kid to some random person(Bill, Tonks's, etc.), legally he's obligated to give the child to Petunia as the closest living relative REGARDLESS of the muggle/wix fact because we see nothing otherwise. And honestly, a muggle neighborhood is great for protection - who would expect the Boy-Who-Lived to be with muggles?? And dumbledore and McG couldn't raise him - they both have 3 jobs and cannonicly, Dumbledore isn't usually around Hogwarts, and McG isn't around for her Gryfondors(as far as we know). Plus, they had just killed the main leader of the war, not the minions, which means that they were /both/ needed to help with the clean-up as well as the trials(for dumbledore at least) and the re-structuring of the Ministry. There was a throwaway comment somewhere about how Dumbledore was being bombarded with owls from Fudge. And /why/ would Dumbledore have checked on Harry? He a) presumably didn't have time for at least a year or two, and b) doing so had the chance of revealing where harry was and c) ...does the headmaster of sisters school usually visit to check on your nephew? that makes no sense.
