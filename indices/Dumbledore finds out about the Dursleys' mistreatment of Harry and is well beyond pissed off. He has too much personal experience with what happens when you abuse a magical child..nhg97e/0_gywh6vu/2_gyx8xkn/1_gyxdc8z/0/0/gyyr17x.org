"Petunia had dibs"

Harry isn't a front seat of a car, he's a baby! He didn't even talk to Petunia and Vernon directly to ask them if they wanted a baby to take care of.

Dumbledore just left Harry alone, in the middle of the night,outside.

Dumbledore could have woken Vernon and Petunia up, if they had been hostile, odds are, he would have taken Harry away automatically.

Dumbledore himself could have helped raised Harry at Hogwarts, I understand Dumbledore not wanting Harry to know he's famous, but Harry needed to know he's magical, and surely he knew enough about Petunia Evans to know that she would keep stuff like Harry being a Wizard secret. Surely Lily and even James have made enough negative remarks about Petunia Evans.

He didn't even have anyone visit Harry throughout the years to make sure that Harry was okay and adjusted properly.

I like Dumbledore, he's a fascinating character. But Rowling made him and many other adults stupid for the sake of plot, so it's no wonder why authors bash certain characters.
