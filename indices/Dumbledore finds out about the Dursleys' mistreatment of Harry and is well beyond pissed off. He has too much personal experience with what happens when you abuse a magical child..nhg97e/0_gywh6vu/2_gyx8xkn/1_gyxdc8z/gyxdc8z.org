But Dumbledore was all right with using his power to send Hagrid to get Harry though wasn't he and abandon a baby on a doorstep without even speaking to the owners and if they actually wanted to have a baby to look after pretty much forcing them to take the baby in. The only reason they accepted Harry is because they were afraid of Dumbledore.

I'm sure a lot of magical people would have happily raised Harry including the Tonskes, if Dumbledore talked to them and explained what was going on. Harry didn't belong in the muggle world he should have been raised in tha magical one.
