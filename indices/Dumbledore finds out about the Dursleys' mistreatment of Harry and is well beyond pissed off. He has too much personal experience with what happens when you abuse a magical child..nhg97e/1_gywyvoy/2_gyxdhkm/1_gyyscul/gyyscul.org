That's my top theory about Credence tbh. That he was a magically powerful abuse victim and Grindelwald needed an Obscurial for some reason and made up a backstory so that Credence would feel important and also feel abandoned to motivate him to fight against Albus.

Also, regarding Johnny, I was also very upset when he was abandoned, and my knee-jerk reaction was to just stop following the FB franchise entirely, but now I'm kind of on the fence. I'm definitely not going to /pay/ to watch, but they definitely could've done worse than Mads Mikkelsen.
