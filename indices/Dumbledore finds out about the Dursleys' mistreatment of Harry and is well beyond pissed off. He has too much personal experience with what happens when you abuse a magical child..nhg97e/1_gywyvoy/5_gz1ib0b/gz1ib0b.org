When I think of Grindelwald and his, from what we were able to see in his initial interaction with Credence, "Magic is Might" mentality, I expect in the end it won't have much to do with Credence at all.

I believe the obscurius that's attached itself to Credence was the one that got created by Ariana. (Depending on the mechanics behind how obscurials work.) Whether it created a body "aka Credence" or attached to a squid who felt familiar to Ariana.

That would explain the Dumbledore link for me.

Whatever happened in the duel between the Dumbledores and Grindelwald, whether it was because of Ariana being an obscurial / Grindelwald wanting the obscurius for whatever reason / just them fighting, Ariana's death might have been none of them, but the obscurius overwhelming her and escaping.

Que, Grindelwald sees the powerful entity as the real Ariana, Albus sees it as ultimate punishment or 'cost' for trying to achieve too much personal power and tempers himself (become a school teacher), and Abberforth (who we see has a portrait of Ariana) is the one actually looking for the obscurius to put it to rest, not Albus.

Probably just mental gymnastics to have something more substantial than "secret subling shows up" shenanigans. :D
