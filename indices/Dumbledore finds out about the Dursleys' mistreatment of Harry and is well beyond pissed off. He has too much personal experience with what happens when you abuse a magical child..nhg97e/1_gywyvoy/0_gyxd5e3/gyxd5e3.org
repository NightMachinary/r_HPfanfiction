I really hope he isn't Dumbledore's brother. The only way they could make that fit would be retconning everything we know about the Dumbledores:

Kendra died in 1899, Credence is to young to be her son.

Percival was in Azkaban since 1890 and died there some time after that.

It' not possible for Albus and Credence to share parents without retconning the etablished backstory.

Him being a secret Dumbledore could still be possible - through Aberforth. We now that Ariana died to young for being Credences mother. Albus is gay, so he probably wouldn't have fathered a child unknowingly. That leaves Aberforth. For all we know he could have had sex with a woman and didn't know she got pregnant. Or he didn't care (but seeing how caring he was with Ariana, I wouldn't think that could be the case). That would be even more interesting than Credence being Albus' brother.

Aberforth already lost Ariana because of Albus and Grindelwald. His child being used against them would be really interesting.
