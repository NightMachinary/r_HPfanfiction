Yeah but there is also a problem with that.

Percival was in azkaban before credence can be conceived. If we believe the time line as we know it is correct then it can only be a child of Albus or Aberforth (or a cousin)

Because unless he is a half brother and the family name is in the female line then it doesn't make sense to be Ablus's brother.
