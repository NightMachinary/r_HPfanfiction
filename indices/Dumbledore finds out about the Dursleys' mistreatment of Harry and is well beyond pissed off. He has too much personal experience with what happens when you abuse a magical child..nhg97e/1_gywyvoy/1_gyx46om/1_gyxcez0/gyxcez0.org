  The question I have is how old was Arianna when she died? Is one of the incidents that traumatised her further rape? Is that why the father goes out and murders the boys who did it?

That wouldn't fit the timeline. Percival killed the muggles before Albus went to Hogwarts. Being the son of a mugglemurder effected young Albus - that's the reason he befriended Elphias Doge in his first year. They were both outsiders at Hogwarts.

Ariana was younger that Albus and Aberforth. So she was around six when the attack happened.
