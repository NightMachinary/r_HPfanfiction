I've been doing this with the stories I'm working on right now. Though, I still have to take into account the blood wards. Like it or not, Lily's blood is what protects Harry. Book 5 (OOTP) chapter 37 explained that Dumbledore placed a charm on Harry to shield him, but Petunia has to take Harry in order to seal the charm because, as Dumbledore said to Harry, "Where your mother's blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort."

So, to get around this, I found some other previously-unknown relative of Lily's who could take Harry in. Hey, no one said the one with his "mother's blood" has to be Petunia. It could be one of Lily's long, lost cousin or brother or something. As long as they're directly related to Lily, it should work. So, blood wards solved. And Harry's no longer abused.
