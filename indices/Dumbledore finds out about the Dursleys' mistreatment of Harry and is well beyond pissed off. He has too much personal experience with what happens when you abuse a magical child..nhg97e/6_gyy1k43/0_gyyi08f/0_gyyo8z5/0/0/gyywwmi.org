Not sure what your point is. The Dursleys /did/ harm Harry. My problem with this prompt is that it makes it sound like Dumbledore wouldn't give a single shit about the abuse if it was against a muggle, or if there wasn't the relatively high likelihood of abused wizard kids turning into world-destroying monsters.

Your analogy doesn't even make sense, do you think the Dursleys tried to abuse Harry but accidentally abused a bystander?

And if you shoot an AR-15 at a kid and aliens see it and decide to destroy Earth because of it, then I will be mad at you for shooting at a kid, not for causing the end of the world with your "negligence".
