But that's exactly my point, the Dursleys /could not know/ what harm they were causing except for the harm to Harry. The only knowledge they had about magic was from Petunia being Lily's sister, and it is highly unlikely that Lily would have explained to Petunia that magical children should never be abused because that might lead to the end of the world.

So the only harm that remains that they /should/ have known about is the harm to Harry as a person, but this is apparently not at all what matters to Dumbledore in this idea.
