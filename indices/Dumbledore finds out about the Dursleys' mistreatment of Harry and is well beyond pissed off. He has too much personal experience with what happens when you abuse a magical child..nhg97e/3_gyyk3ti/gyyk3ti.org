A related idea: you know the bad manipulative Dumbledore fics which are like â€˜Dumbledore left Harry at the Dursley's so he'd be easily manipulated and loyal to Dumbledore', an explanation which doesn't make sense /at all/? It would be interesting to see a fic where Dumbledore left Harry at the Dursley's with the intent of him becoming an Obscurus because he has personal experience with what happens when a magical child is abused. I think it fits with the prophecy- /a power he knows not/- because what other power could a young kid hope to develop against Voldemort, who has gathered obscure magical knowledge for decades? Obviously it would be OOC Dumbledore but if people are going to weote a manipulative Dumbledore fic then I'd like to see an actual plausible reason for once.
