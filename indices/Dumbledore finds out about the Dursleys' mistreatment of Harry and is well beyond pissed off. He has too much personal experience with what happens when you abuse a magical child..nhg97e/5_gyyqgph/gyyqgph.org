Linkffn(12740667) This isn't the central focus of the fic, but Dumbledore rescues Harry from the Dursleys after he doesn't respond to his Hogwarts letter. The author likes to emphasize that while Harry was physically abused, the worst affects doesn't come from injuries that can be healed by magic, but by the isolation(the cupboard) and lack of emotional development that being raised by the Dursleys left Harry with. Features a mentor!Dumbledore that is genuinely concerned for Harry's wellbeing and his similarities to Tom Riddle and Grindelwald. As the story goes on, Harry gets darker and darker, but dark isn't evil. In the end, he's still trying to defeat Voldemort and doing the right thing, even if he is pretty creepy. Unfortunately abandoned, but I still recommend it. Other than that, you could probably google “Dumbledore rescues Harry from the Dursleys Fanfiction” and find results for what you're looking for.
