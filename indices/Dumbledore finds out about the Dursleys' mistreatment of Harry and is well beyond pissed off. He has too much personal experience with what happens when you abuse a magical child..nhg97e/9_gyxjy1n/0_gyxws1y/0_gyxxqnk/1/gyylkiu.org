The explanation for this is made explicitly clear in canon. Dumbledore knew Voldemort would come back, and possibly very soon. He believed any other normal protection would not work. What is Voldemort came back and he didn't know? And Voldemort slowly worked past the protections of another home? The protection over Privet Drive was magic Voldemort didn't understand.

Your solution would have resulted in a dead kid. If not worse.
