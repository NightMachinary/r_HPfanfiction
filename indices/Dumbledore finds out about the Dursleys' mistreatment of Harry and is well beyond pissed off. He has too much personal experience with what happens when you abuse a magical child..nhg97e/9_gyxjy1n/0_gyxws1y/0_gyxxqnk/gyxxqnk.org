Nope, that aint fanfiction. ALways felt that way about him even before I read fanfiction. WHat kind of person leaves Harry with people like the Dursleys? TO be raised in that Hell that he did for all those years? At any moment Dumbledore could have stopped by to check on how Harry was doing and he didn't. Everyone was celebrating the downfall for a time anyway of Tom Riddle, but no one bothered to consider what the Boy WHo Lived was going through with losing both his parents and growing up the way he did.
