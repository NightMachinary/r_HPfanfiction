/No/, my rebuttal is that you have zero evidence of your claims, and that the "power" needed /is/ Lily's sacrifice. That alone is what fuels the magic, and there is, /again/, zero evidence that it needs further fueling.

Go ahead. Provide a single quote from the books where we're told /Lily's/ spell needs to be powered repeatedly. Not Dumbledore's spell on Privet Drive, that's a separate spell. I mean /Lily's./

  why does he say that Harry must go back every year for I believe two weeks for his own safety.

So he has a safe haven! So he can be absolutely safe from Voldemort /and/ his followers. Lily's protection only protects him from Voldemort, and that protection could be bypassed, /as we saw/ in the fourth book.

But Privet Drive's protection stayed even when Lily's was cancelled out when Voldemort took Harry's blood. Why? If the Privet Drive spell is meant to only fuel Lily's spell, why the fuck does Harry go back there after Lily's magic is gone? You completely ignored that on my last comment.

I've never met someone so confident despite adamantly refusing to provide a single shred of evidence.

Provide evidence in your next comment or I'm blocking you.
