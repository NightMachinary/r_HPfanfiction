So your rebuttals are, "it stays powered because it stays powered," and that a piece of magic literally requiring sacrifice does not need much power to block a killing curse. Yeah, sure, alright. Whatever you say mate. I'm just gonna be here laughing my ass off at your "response."

Also your argument about him not needing to go there to recharge Lily's protection, why does he say that Harry must go back every year for I believe two weeks for his own safety. Why must he go there if he can leave after two weeks without Dumbledore worrying about his safety. It's as if he has some kind of protection that requires close contact with that of a blood relative to stay active. Hmmmmmm.
