Explain why Dumbledore would place him there. One of the most knowledgeable Wizards on magic period. Lily sacrificing herself to save Harry is what essentially triggered the Charm to take hold just like Harry sacrificing himself did the same. That was the casting of it though. Unless you can explain to me how the charm could stay powered for over a decade without the bond of blood(blood wards), than it's pretty obvious. Essentially back up your point with what you know before trying to decunstruct an argument.

We know one of the most knowledgeable people of that universe thought it necessary to protect him, whatever his faults. We know that after over a decade of the Charm being cast, Harry still carried such protections. We know such protections to protect you from the literal Killing Curse requires power, a lot of power. The most likely solution to this than is that what was started by blood could be powered by blood. Harry being the target for a sacrificial piece of magic means he can't likely power it himself. Him powering a sacrificial piece of magic to protect just wouldn't work, because of how the charm itself works.
