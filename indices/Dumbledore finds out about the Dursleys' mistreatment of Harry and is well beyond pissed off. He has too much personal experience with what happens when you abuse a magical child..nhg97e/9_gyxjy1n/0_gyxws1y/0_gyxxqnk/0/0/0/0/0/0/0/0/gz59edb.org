Dude, this isn't even debatable. Go reread the books. Dumbledore placed Harry there for the protection that place granted him from Voldemort and his followers. Dumbledore literally explains this. Dumbledore at NO POINT says Petunia's protection recharges Lily's. Literally never even implies it.

It doesn't even make sense! Why would Harry go back to Petunia after Voldemort bypassed Lily's protection?

#+begin_quote
  We know that after over a decade of the Charm being cast, Harry still carried such protections

Correlation does not mean causation.

#+begin_quote
  We know such protections to protect you from the literal Killing Curse requires power, a lot of power.
#+end_quote

No we don't? All we're told is that it required Lily's sacrifice. We are never /ever/ told it requires a lot of power for it to stick around. You're literally making shit up.

#+begin_quote
  Unless you can explain to me how the charm could stay powered for over a decade
#+end_quote

It stays powered because it stays powered. There is absolutely no reason to believe Lily's magic needs to be recharged. Hogwarts enchantments stayed up for centuries.

This is ridiculous. Go reread the books and stop wasting my time with nonsense. I'm not wasting my time with a user so a stubborn they're arguing against basic canon. Wtf.
