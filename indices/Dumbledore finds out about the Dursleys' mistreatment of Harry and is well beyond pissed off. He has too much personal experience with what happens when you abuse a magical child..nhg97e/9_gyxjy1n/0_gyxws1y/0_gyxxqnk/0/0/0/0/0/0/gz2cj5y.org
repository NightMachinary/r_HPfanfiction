I mean, there is literally /zero/ evidence that Lily's sacrificial magic can only work if Harry stays at the Dursleys. The Bond of Blood Charm is what works if Harry stays with Petunia, but that is not the same magic that Lily invoked which saved Harry from the Killing Curse. They are two separate pieces of magic, and Lily's does not need Petunia's to work. Petunia's doesn't need Lily's, even, not after it's been cast.
