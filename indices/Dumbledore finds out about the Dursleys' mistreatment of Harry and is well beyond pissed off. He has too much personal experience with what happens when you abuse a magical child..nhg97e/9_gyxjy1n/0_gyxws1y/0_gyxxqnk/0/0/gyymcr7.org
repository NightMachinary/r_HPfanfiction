I agree with you mostly, but you've got two things wrong here.

The first is that Dumbledore didn't take the prophecy seriously. He points out to Harry that prophecies don't all even come true.

The second is that it was Lily's sacrificial magic that protected Harry against Quirrell, not Privet Drive's. They're too different things.
