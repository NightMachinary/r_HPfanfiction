Oh I personally subscribe to the manipulative Dumbledore band wagon, but that's it. He's not evil, or plotting against anyone besides Voldemort. He's essentially the leader for one half of the entire war. Yeah it's shitty, and horrible, but considering he has literal prophecy on his side, it makes sense. Essentially he was the general put between a rock, and a hard place.

Sure raising Harry like a pig to slaughter to paraphrase is horrible, but holding that one life above everyone's is worse. We see the story through Harry's eyes, so we are usually on his side, but can you imagine looking at it from Dumbledore's POV? Imagine that you have all this dangerous information, information that you can't really trust others to have, because imagine either someone somehow taking it from them, or how much weight it could put on another's shoulders.

I honestly feel bad for Dumbledore, in a world of magic it's hard to trust others, because what about Polyjuice? Imperius? Compulsions? Etc... He knows there's only one person who can defeat this monster, and the strongest protection for him is also in a house with a bad family. We know the protection was needed, because if he didn't have it that whole confrontation with Quirrel would have ended very differently.
