Rodolphus', as Rabastan has not been mentioned at that point, even by pronoun. It says "Rodolphus died first." Presumably all the "he" pronouns in the next sentence refer to Rodolphus. Then in the following sentence it says "Barty slipped in his blood..." This itself could be ambiguous because it could mean Barty slipped in his /own/ blood, but that is negated by the mention in the second part of that sentence by 'his brother," as Barty presumably does not have a brother present. So "his blood" is Rodolphus' blood.

Oddly, this conversation is sort of similar to another one I had recently on a different platform, but we were deconstructing an art piece instead of a paragraph. It was fan art of Hermione and Draco kissing, and we were trying to figure out if Draco had his hand on Hermione's left or right leg. Took a lot of analysis of her center of gravity in the pic.
