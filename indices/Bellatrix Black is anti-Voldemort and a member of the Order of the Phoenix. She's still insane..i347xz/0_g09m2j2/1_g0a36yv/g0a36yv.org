I enjoyed this wuite a lot. If you decide to preserve it for posterity somewhere, I want to mention that I found it a bit ambiguous when you wrote, " Barty slipped in his blood as his brother was flayed alive...," as if Barty had a brother. I knew what you meant / figured it out after a moment, but maybe you want to make it clearer.
