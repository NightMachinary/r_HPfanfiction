Totally exasperated, until someone criticises his Aunty Bella. At which point you discover that while she didn't make him as psychotic as her, she took that mean sarcastic streak of his and /nurtured/ it.

Anyone who asks him why he doesn't ask her to wind it in a bit, he just looks at them dead on and asks "Would /you/?"
