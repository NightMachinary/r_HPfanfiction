Yep, the books never explicitly state that the stairs move. In PS, when the castle is being described, it does say that everything seemed to move around a lot. But I always took that to mean the suits of armor, and the people in the paintings visiting each other. (Plus the whole bit about walls pretending to be doors or only opening on a specific day or whatever.)

If the stairs moved the way they do in the movies, surely we'd have seen a lot more staircase-related shenanigans in the books.
