Hogwarts was hooked up to a neural network to constantly optimize locations and paths based on class schedules. However, Rowena died before she could teach people how to properly trim the input datasets, and Hogwarts has just been chugging along for a thousand years, collecting data on random wanderings and people trying to find rooms. By now nobody can train out the bad habits without wiping it all and starting fresh.
