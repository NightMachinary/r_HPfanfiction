I just had a sudden incredible idea of Hogwarts as Castle Heterodyne from Girl Genius (Castle Hererodyne /is/ an AI connected with more or less mad science flavored magic to a big old castle. It's creators were definitely crazy to start with and it's had centuries to emulate them, but leaving it alone and partially broken/unmaintained for 25 years didn't help anything...)
