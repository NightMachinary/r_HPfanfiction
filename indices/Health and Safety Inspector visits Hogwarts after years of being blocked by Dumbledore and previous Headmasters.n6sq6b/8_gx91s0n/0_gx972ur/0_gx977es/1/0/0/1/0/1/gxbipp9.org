American here. I went to a Middle School back in the early 2000s that divided students into competing groups that functioned nearly identically to the House system. Whichever group had the most points at the end of the year got pizza.

The only difference between that middle school's system and Hogwarts Houses was that the groups were year-specific. The groups in Sixth Grade were not related to the groups in Seventh Grade or Eighth Grade, for example, and students were sorted into the different groups randomly each year before the school year started.

I wasn't aware most schools in the US don't use that system until after I went to college!
