Yeah, I am a military brat. So, I have been to schools across a number of different states. I have never heard of a school doing something like that before. I had always thought that the Hogwarts system was just something that JKR made up. I thought it was needlessly divisive considering how politically charged the different houses were. Whenever I think of how Hogwarts could have been better, the first thing I do is get rid of the house system. I never liked how they, in fanon and I think canon, tried to define a person purely by what house they were sorted into. I see people having all of those traits in one form or another, to one degree or another. They are not mutually exclusive.
