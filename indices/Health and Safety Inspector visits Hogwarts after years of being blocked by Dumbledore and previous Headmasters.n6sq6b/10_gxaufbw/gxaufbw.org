The irony of this kind of indy!Harry LARP concept, which has been done before, is that Dumbledore massively improved the safety and health standards of Hogwarts.

It used to be common for miscreants and rule-breakers to be tortured for punishment. Dumbledore ended it.

There's a thousand horny teenagers locked up in a castle in Scotland for eight months out of the year. Nobody ends up pregnant.

A basilisk was set on the student body twice, but somehow only one person died. This strongly implies there's some kind of passive probability manipulation going on at Hogwarts, when a person seeing the basilisk directly is the outlier in a sea of freak accidents with reflections, mirrors, highly-polished armor stands, camera lenses, and conveniently placed ghosts.

The real joke here is that Hogwarts probably is the safest school of magic in the world. But nobody ever wants to take that and then wonder what the actual fuck might be happening in Durmstrang and Beaubaxtons.

Here's an idea. The delegations from the other two schools refuse to leave Hogwarts when the tournament is over, because it really is safer. They have now tasted the (relative) safety of Hogwarts, and refuse to be dragged back to their own schools that are awash in feral werewolves, menaced by cruel pixies and fairies, and frequently raided by cheese-addicted trolls.
