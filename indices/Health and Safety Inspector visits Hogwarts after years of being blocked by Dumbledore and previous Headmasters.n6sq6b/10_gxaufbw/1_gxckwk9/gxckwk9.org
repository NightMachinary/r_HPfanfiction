I'm imagining a story involving the very confused Beauxbatons delegation, armed to the teeth and expecting Hogwarts to be like their school:

Fleur approached the Great Hall a few minutes after dinner had begun. Her blue cloak was streaked with green blood that resisted even her strongest cleaning charm, and a lumpy burlap bag floated behind her. Fleur had hoped to be more punctual, but it took her longer than expected to find what she needed.

As Fleur entered into the Great Hall, she stopped, confused. There were students eating at tables full of food, but no payment table. Uncertain of what to do, she approached a table of students.

"Pardonnez moi. Where can I exchange my kill for dinner?"

"Your what?" Ron said, nearly choking on a buttered roll.

"Yes, my kill." Fleur reached into her bag, and carefully removed a fresh acromantula corpse. "I hope this will suffice" she said. She knew that it was probably too small to merit a full serving of dinner, but hoped that she would at least get some salad for it.

Fleur's thoughts were interrupted by a scream and then a crash. The red-headed boy was now sprawled on the floor. Sighing, she returned the spider into her bag and decided to try another table.
