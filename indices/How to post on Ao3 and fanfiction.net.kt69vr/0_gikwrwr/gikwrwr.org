I can't help with Ao3, I am too new to it to understand the mechanics to the site. Posting wise it is pretty easy.

FFN (fanfiction.net) that I can help with. It sounds like you used the copy and paste feature and just uploaded the document without checking. For whatever reason, ffn been having tech issue and one of them is the copy and paste doc creation. I suggest going to doc manager. Delete what's there and then paste your stuff. Then just reupload your chapter. Hopefully that solve your issue.
