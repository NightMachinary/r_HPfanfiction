I can confirm that posting on Ao3 is super easy!

When you make your account and log in, at the top right corner it will say your username and the first button next to it says “Post”.

If you click it you get a drop down menu with the options “New work” or “Import work”. I assume Import would be uploading your files but I always go “New work” and fill in the information for my fic.

You can copy and paste your first chapter where it says to. The text default is html so I always switch to Rich Text so it looks cleaner and I can easily make changes I want like italizing words.

Hope this helps!
