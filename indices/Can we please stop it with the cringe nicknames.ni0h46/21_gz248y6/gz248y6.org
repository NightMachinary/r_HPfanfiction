I honesty think there's a bit of a cultural divide in the nicknames people use, but I 100% think that a bunch of kids would be using disrespectful versions of professors and other people's names, and they wouldn't be elegant for the most part. Like, I mean Draco comes with â€˜scar head', for example, which isn't exactly the height of wit, is it?

most insults people come up with to be disrespectful and show disdain in real life aren't very elegant either, and are generally made up on the fly

I have to be honest, I kind of prefer those silly names to all of the hyphenated ones in canon---though I do agree that some are overused to the point of aggravation
