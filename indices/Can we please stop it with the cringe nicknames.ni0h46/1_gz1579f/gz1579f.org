My main objection to those isn't that they're not very funny, it's that they're not very British. We'd basically never use the word 'dork'. Sounds like something Bart Simpson would use. It's significantly more tame than any joke or nickname most UK teens would use - we'd be more likely to call Dumbledore a 'nonce' than a 'dork'. Dork is too... tame 80s Teen High School Drama for us - similar to 'poindexter' or the like.

(Nonce is UK slang for paedophile, or sometimes other sex crimes).

No comment on whether they're good or bad humour because that's relative, but those nicknames are very much not British humour. Look at the kind of jokes Eggsy from Kingsman makes, or anyone from Skins or Inbetweeners or the like. Those would be far more common.
