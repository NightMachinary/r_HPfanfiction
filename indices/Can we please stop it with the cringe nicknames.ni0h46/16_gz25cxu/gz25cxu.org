As utterly cringy as I find them I do find them to be fairly easy red flag that a fic is going to suck. My basic rule of thumb is that if it isn't a specifically a crack fic designed to not be taken seriously I immediately hit the X and find something else to read if I see it more than twice in the first three chapters.

Also teenagers might not have the greatest sense of humor but Mouldyshorts? Dumbledork? That's the kind of thing teenagers would make fun of someone for saying, not say it themselves.
