The characters ARE children. If anything writers write them too mature.

Are you seriously telling me that you didn't have nicknames for the administration of your high school? We did back in the day known to historians only as 'the 60s'.

and as far as Voldemort and nicknames go, I would suggest you take a look at what actual adult soldiers/sailors/marines of whatever countries called the leaders of the enemy forces. This is how people deal with stress.
