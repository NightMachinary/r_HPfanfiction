See, to me it's just felt natural, going back at least to the 9th grade English class where I talked about Macbeth having the "Macdufflets" killed, to refer to a person's kids as Namelets, Namelings, or Namespawn in the style of owlet::owl, duckling::duck, and frogspawn::frog. So Prongslet has never bothered me since Harry is the sole Prongslet and it sounds better than Prongapawn or Prongsling.

Obviously, to those who didn't call James Potter "Prongs", Harry would be the Jamesling or Lilyspawn. Unless it's a Severitus story, then he could be a Snapelet.
