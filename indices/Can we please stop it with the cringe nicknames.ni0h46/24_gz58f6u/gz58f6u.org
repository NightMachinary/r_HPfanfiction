I always thought that calling Voldemort Riddle or Tommy boy (no offense to the late Chris Farley) would be more insulting, in universe, to the man/human-snake hybrid abomination than any other play on Voldemort.

Anything to bring up the point in his life when he was weak and powerless, or anything that so much as hinted that he could be /common/ is going to hit harder (in my opinion) than mangling his stage name, so to speak.
