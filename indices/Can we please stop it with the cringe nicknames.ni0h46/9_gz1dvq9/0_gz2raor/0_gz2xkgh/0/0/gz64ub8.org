Well I can imagine Ron acting like he sometimes does with Hermione. For example how he'll affectionately call her Barmy for wanting to go to the library all of a sudden.

I think its partly cause Ron's grown up around magic and would kind of see them like a kindred spirit of his dad (someone totally fascinated by muggles but for them it would be the other way around) but also as someone who's not really studious is like "....why do you want to study more?" And finds it weird. .... but also would remind him of his brothers

I mean if you look at his brothers I could see Bill studying obscure stuff "cause it's cool", percy for his future career I guess and charlie..... well dragons.

Everyone needs a hobby I suppose
