About the only nickname that I like is 'the dark tosser', because that actually sounds like something I would say, having also been raised in the south east like Harry was.

As others have mentioned, a lot of the nicknames that I've seen feel too Americanised, particularly for mid 90's UK. We don't/didn't use the term 'dork', and shorts are outerwear here, not underwear, so moldyshorts has also never resonated with me like it might with non-English readers.

There are others that make sense, but the issue with those is the persistent usage of them, to the point where the original names are seldom actually used. If it gets that bad then actually reading the fic often becomes hard to do unless the story is /really/ compelling.
