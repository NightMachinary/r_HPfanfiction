Moldyfarts. Foldyshorts. Dummyderp. Simplefork. Dimplewart. Just trying to think of the most childish names I can. Anyone want to help? On second thought, I rather like “foldyshorts.” It's a bit of a sore point for Mr. Riddle. Also, Simplefork? That's a good insult if I ever saw one. I'd hate to be called that.
