/“Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.”/

I wish they made MORE stupid name jokes about Mouldy Voldy.

He's a petty, overly-dramatic megalomaniac who deserves no respect.

Also, they're teenagers. (Harry's a particular sassy one) they would obviously joke about the most serious of things.
