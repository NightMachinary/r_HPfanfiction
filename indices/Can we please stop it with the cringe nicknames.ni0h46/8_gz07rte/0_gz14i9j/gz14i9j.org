I agree with teenager humor not being the best; it would be okay if it would be used ironically or with the clear intend to show that this is inmature teenager behavior. But the point is, in most fanfics this names are used unironically.

And with Voldemort you have to remember, that we are talking about the person who is alone in the Gryffindor-boys-dorm responsible for: Harry and Neville having no parents, Ron having no uncles on his mother's side and Dean having no longer his biological father. I don't think they would joke about the person who murdered their families with cringe nicknames.

So outside of some very rare exceptions (like Peeves using them) this cringe nicknames are absolut not fitting and bad writing even if we talk about teenagers.
