Please forgive me for my sins, for I have used "Dumbles" (I am cringing while writing this) in my first ever fanfic. I already know that it isn't that good (I like my idea but I think it could've been written better in a slightly less crunch way). I also decided not to start writing fics and stories until I practice by rewriting the short stories I wrote when I was younger.

Sorry, I'm getting off track. Back to my apology.

Forgive my sins of using a cringe nickname more than once in my first fanfic, for I shall not repeat this newbie mistake ever again (unless the circumstances allow it).
