walkingtheplank.org is a Harry/Snape fanfic site. Great archive, though it's not updated much anymore. AO3 also has a healthy assortment of Harry/Snape (around 2800 stories). That having been said, you should read "Ashes of Armageddon" by Emily Waters if you haven't already.

Oh! And LJ has a very active Snarryficfind community with about a hundred tags. Here's the URL for the slave!Snape tag: [[http://snarryficfind.livejournal.com/tag/slave!severus]] I'm positive you'll find something to your liking.
