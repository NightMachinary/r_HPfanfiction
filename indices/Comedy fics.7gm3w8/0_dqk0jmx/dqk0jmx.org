linkffn(Like a Red-Headed Stepchild) and linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them) are both hilarious, but you probably know those already.

Somewhat like /Seventh Horcrux/ is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Slightly Suggestive Handshake), but it appears to be abandoned.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Garden of Intrigue) and linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor) are both less on the cracky side, but with a strong comedy element. The second one features Hermione as opposed to Harry.
