The Red Knight

Ron is interesting there, you'd think he's very OP at the beginning... until he is absolutely outclassed as the story unfolds. Seeing him trying to play Hermione and Harry (because actual Hermione hates his guts and Harry... well, it's complicated...) and just barely failing forward is really nice. I mean, the guy had a single clear win throughout the story and now he'll have to give it up too.

And yes, I enjoy watching him suffer. It really elevates his character. It even makes the pretty tropey supportive cast a little better.
