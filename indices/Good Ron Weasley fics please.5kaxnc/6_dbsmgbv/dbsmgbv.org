Have you tried [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/900634/Solstice-Muse][Solstice Muse's]] fics? She writes pretty lengthy Ron-centric stories... don't know how action-packed they are, but I think they're good.

Or you could try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11230962/1/Son-of-the-archer][Son of the Archer]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11884262/1/Son-of-the-archer-and-The-Boy-Who-Lived][sequel]] by Melancholy's Sunshine. It's an AU in which one year old Ron is kidnapped by Death Eaters, rescued by Hawkeye of the Avengers and grows up as his adoptive son.

Oh, and there's the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739/1/Weasley-Girl][Weasley Girl]] stories by Hyaroo, in which Ron was born a girl. First story's more Harry-centric, but the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9932798/1/Weasley-Girl-Secrets-of-the-Past][sequel, Secrets of the Past]] switches to Fem!Ron as the main character.
