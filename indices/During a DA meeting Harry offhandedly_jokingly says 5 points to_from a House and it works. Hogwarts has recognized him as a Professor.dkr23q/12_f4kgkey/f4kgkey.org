I really like the idea. However...

I don't see much that you can do with it - at least, not on its own.

What can a professor do?

Give and deduct points: interesting, but while Umbridge is there, that's pointless (huh... No pun intended)

Give detention: again, not while Umbridge is around

Being payed: possible, but only after the year is over and again, that doesn't have much bearing on the plot

Be up after curfew: that has possibilities, but as soon as Umbridge finds out, she will put a stop to it

Be allowed to continue teaching them, even though there is the decree of the ministry: Hahaha, no, that's never gonna fly.

Thinking about it, there actually were two things that I came up with, that Harry might be able to do: go to Hogsmead whenever he wants to and access the restricted section of the library. Both have a lot of potential and at least the library shouldn't be that easy to block by Umbridge

But other than that, you would probably need something like the trope where someone researches the Hogwards rules and finds out something that was previously unknown and that will help Harry (and maybe other teachers) take care of the situation
