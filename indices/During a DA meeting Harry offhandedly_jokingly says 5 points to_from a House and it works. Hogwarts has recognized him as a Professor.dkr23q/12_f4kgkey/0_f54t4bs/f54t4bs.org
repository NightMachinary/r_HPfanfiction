I'd take it from this angle: There can only be one teacher for each subject, so since Hogwarts recognizes Harry as the teacher of Defense Against the Dark Arts, anything he does overrides the actions of Umbridge, and since the Ministry decree that allowed her to teach there was only applicable if another viable teacher for a subject wasn't found, allowing the Ministry to assign one, then Dumbledore can by rights kick her out as she is no longer needed nor recognized as a teacher.

And whether you play this serious or not serious, the shenanigans of using Harry as a propup Defense teacher just because it means they can get rid of Umbridge as a testament to just how horrible a teacher she is will always be good for a few laughs.
