So I've thought about it a bit more and realized a few things. I don't necessarily want Harry to even know what happened because I don't want him to abuse it. I want the other professors to notice some discrepancies with the house points and when they look into it in the logbook or whatever they have, they see things like “5 points to Hufflepuff for a wonderful shield charm” or “20 points to Ravenclaw for the first successful Patronus” or even “10 points from Gryffindor for cursing someone with their back turned”. The teachers are baffled and trying to figure out which professor it is.
