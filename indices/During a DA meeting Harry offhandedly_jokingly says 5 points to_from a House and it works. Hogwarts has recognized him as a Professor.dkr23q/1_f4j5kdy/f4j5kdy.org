Hmm...I did see a one-shot, I don't remember if it was in a collection or not, that actually went with something like that.\\
As it went, at OWL exam time, the students were given truth-telling quills, and one of the questions they had to answer was which professor had taught them.\\
As it turned out, the vast majority of them wrote that Harry Potter had taught them DADA, not Dolores Umbridge. So, she got paid for the tiny handful of students she /did/ teach, which amounted to a handful of knuts, and Harry received a fair few galleons and an invitation to teach next year. Or something like that.
