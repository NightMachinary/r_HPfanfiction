I'm now imagining the entire DA sitting around and coming up with point deductions for various Slytherins including alums (Umbridge, Snape, etc.). Hogwarts accepts them all.

In the morning Slytherin house has set a record for the lowest negative house point score in history. The record is then broken every subsequent day for the remainder of the year.
