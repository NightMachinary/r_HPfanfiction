Hermione realizes she can game the system and starts volunteering and complimenting Harry whenever possible to earn points. Harry figures out what she is doing and starts randomly awarding points to other DA members to annoy her.

"Five points to Ravenclaw for showing up to meetings on time. Ten points to Hufflepuff for remembering to bring your wand."

Hermione eventually becomes so enraged she volunteers to join the Inquisitorial Squad.
