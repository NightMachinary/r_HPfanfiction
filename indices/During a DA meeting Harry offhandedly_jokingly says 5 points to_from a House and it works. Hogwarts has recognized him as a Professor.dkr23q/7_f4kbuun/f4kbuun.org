Haven't read either in years, but we're my intro to fanfic, so might be worse than I remember, but I definitely remember accidental point awards by Harry ... though it was Harry replacing the dada professor, and teaching class.... all years... also one of the few genuine I.fucked.up.lets.fix.this versions of Dumbledore

Is one I confuse often with ledgends, but I'm pretty sure it had this too? (Read it years ago, few free to correct me) It's a series, so...

I've read a few others as well, but none really stick out, though maybe someone could add to this?
