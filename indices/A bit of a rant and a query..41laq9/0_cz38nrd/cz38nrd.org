Harry Potter is so full of scenes that can easily be interpreted as manipulative, set-up and forced, that the quick and rough romance of Harry and Ginny may seem like a set-up as well to the cynical mind.

The random encounter at Kings Cross is one of those scenes that can easily be explained away, or used as evidence for the evil austrian-archduke channeling Molly Weasley to marry her children to as much money, prestige and magical power/knowledge as possible.

If you want the Weasleys to be greedy bastards, then you can start at Book 1 and end at Book 7 and you'll have the greatest conspiracy to make Harry Potter their capital, ready for your story to use. There /are/ more convoluted plans in this series. Drugging Harry with lovepotion isn't so far out there.

I hold the opinion that once, long ago, this trope could've made a good story. Unfortunatly, Weasley and Dumbledore bashing destroyed that hope for all time.
