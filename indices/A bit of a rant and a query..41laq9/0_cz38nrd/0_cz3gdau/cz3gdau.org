In the scope of a self contained book ( here meaning that Harry Potter wasn't a series) I fully believe that the Kings Crossing scene is easily explained.

But once we delve into the works and the world I cannot do so.

So how do you? I'm genuinely curious.

I'm not one to jump on the 'Steal all Harry's shit' theory but I can't just explain that scene away.
