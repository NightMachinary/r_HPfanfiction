The most innocent explanaition: A game. Remember that Ginny is 10, Ron is 11 and the twins are 12. It wouldn't be too far out that Molly is just teasing them by asking where the gate is.

Or we could entertain the thought of it being planned, but with benevolent reasons. Dumbledore knows that Harry isn't even informed of the wizarding culture, but refrains from too direct an impact. He asks Molly to place herself at 9^{3/4} and guide Harry through.

The reason why ROn sought Harry out can also easily be explained away by the fact that he's the Boy-Who-Lived and Ron was curious. Taking a leap of faith he decides to sit with the hero.

And so on and so forth. There are many explanations out there.
