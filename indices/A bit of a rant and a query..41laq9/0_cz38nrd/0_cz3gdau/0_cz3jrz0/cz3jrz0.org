Imagine you have a bunch of kids. Every year you send some off to school. While doing so you have to occupy the minds of the kids that are not send off, but will be all focussed on their older siblings leaving. What many parents do in such a case is making the kids in question feel included /useful by asking questions. It probably is a tradition that those kids not going to school are supposed to answer.

It also makes sure the younger ones know where to meet if you get separated.

Now, Molly's "littlest kid" is ten, not five, so that tactic is probably not overly sucesful, but Molly knows it is different this year, with ALL of Ginny's brothers leaving and, not quite knowing how to help her feel better, she resorts to old parenting tricks, even if her child is actually a bit too old for that.

At least that's how I always interpreted the scene.
