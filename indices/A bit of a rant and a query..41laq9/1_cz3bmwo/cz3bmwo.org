For some reason I thought that Molly is seen talking about love potions with Ginny and Hermione during the visit to WWW in HP6. I think she even states that she used one to get Arthur's attention, but I might be mixing up canon with fanfic.

It could be innocent, joking girl-talk or not. Makes some cynical readers assume that a love potion is the reason for Harry and Ginny's relationship and Hermione and Ron's relationship.
