It doesn't come from in-universe. It comes from butthurt Harmonians, who never cared much about canon in the first place.

In fact, in canon Molly is unhappy about Harry and Ginny being together. In the beginning of DH, Ginny has to confront Molly about it, IIRC.

Molly also wasn't happy at all about the marriage of Bill and Fleur, despite Fleur's "prestige".
