  Why people don't just write the events in their stories to not include Harry/Ginny in the first place I don't totally understand,

Because a lot of fanfic authors are bad. Since they're bad they fall back on cliches and overused tropes. I'm not saying that's always a bad thing and sometimes they're used well or in interesting ways.

But 90% of the time it's because an author is lazy or bad or both.

A good author might explain away the Harry/Ginny relationship by simply ignoring it happened or adding a line about how they tried dating but in the end decided to be friends. If you want a decent reason perhaps Ginny had trouble living up to the expectations of being Harry's partner. Being the girlfriend/wife of Harry Potter probably comes with a lot of public scrutiny that she may not want. (It doesn't really work in canon since she becomes a famous Quidditch player but a good author could find something)

Instead bad authors fall back on overused poorly explained cliches like Molly and Ginny using love potions to force Harry to love her. (Even though we see how love potions work in HBP and that's not even close to what happens with Harry) They're probably the same authors that think having a love interest walk in on a rival forcing themselves on Harry is good relationship drama. Spoiler alert it's not.
