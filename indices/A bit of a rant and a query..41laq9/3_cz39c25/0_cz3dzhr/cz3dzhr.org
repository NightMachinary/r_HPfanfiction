But it also isn't limited to Harmony shippers. Really, a lot of stories out there that /don't/ have Harry/Ginny try to justify it by making Ginny completely incompatible. What is the easiest way to do this? Make any possible canon connection a result of love potions!

I've seen the love potions plot in Harry/Luna, Harry/Daphne, Harry/Severus, Harry/LV, Harry/Draco and Harry/Richard B. Riddick (yes, from Pitch Black) to name a few. The love potions plot comes up fairly often in slash stories to also justify Harry changing his sexual orientation.

Why people don't just write the events in their stories to not include Harry/Ginny in the first place I don't totally understand, but it probably comes back to the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStationsOfTheCanon][stations of the canon]].^{Warning:} ^{TVtropes}
