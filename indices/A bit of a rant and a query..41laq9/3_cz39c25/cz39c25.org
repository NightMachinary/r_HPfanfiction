3 lines does not qualify as a rant, buddy.

Anyway, if you've read fics like that, you've probably noticed that they come from the same group of people, A.K.A Harmony shippers. Arguably, the most infamous subfandom within the entire Harry Potter fanbase. Not to say that they are all awful, but they haven't given themselves a good name.

They generally try to justify their points by calling Ron an abusive second coming of satan as well as calling Ginny a one-dimensional fangirl, all the while conveniently ignoring any moments of character from either of the two and also while forgetting any of Harry and Hermione's flaws.

In fact, if I remember correctly, when Molly talks about using a love potion with Ginny and Hermione in HBP, Hermione's reaction is giggling. Yet Ron is of course the person who drugged her for realsies.

It's not nearly as popular as you think though. Keep in mind that only a very small percentage of the HP fanbase read HP fanfiction. I guarantee that if you that if someone were to go the HP reddit and say that Harry and Ginny were drugged by Molly with love potion, they will stare at you like you just sucked off a Hippogriff.
