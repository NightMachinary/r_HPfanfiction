In HBP (iirc) Mrs. Weasley cracks a minor joke about love potions. Maybe it wasn't even a joke, I don't have the book handy. Of course, to the avid Harmony shippers out there, this is clear evidence that she is involved in an evil plan to get Ginny and Harry together. I think it's also a symptom of the "chest monster syndrome" that Harry seems to have - the vociferous crew decided to latch on this as ultimate proof of the Weasley matriarch's corruption, even insinuating that that was how she got Arthur.

Pretty much all Weasley-bashing can be attributed to radical Harmonians, as a rule of thumb.
