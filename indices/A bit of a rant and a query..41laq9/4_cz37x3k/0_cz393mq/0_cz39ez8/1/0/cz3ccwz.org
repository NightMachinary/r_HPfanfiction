To provide a similar rebuttal, but not being as frothy-at-the-mouth-y as the other bloke was, JKR never did say she would have put Harry and Hermione together, when looking back. She was much more diplomatic in saying that it might have been a valid path to go down (or, "it /could/ have happened"). The only thing JKR stated unconditionally was that Ron and Hermione aren't very compatible, and that she ended up pairing them together for reasons more personal than they were narratively sound. She went on to say Ron and Hermione's marriage would have required a lot of work to last as long as it does in canon. She didn't ever say that Harry and Hermione should have married; that was just a misquote the media ran with.
