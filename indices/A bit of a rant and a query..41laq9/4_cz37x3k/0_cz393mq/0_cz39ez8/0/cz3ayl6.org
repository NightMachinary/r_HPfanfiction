It's hard to explain away Ron and Hermione's 'fundamental incompatibility,' but I get what you're saying. Just because Rowling has a few fleeting doubts about the Hr/R pairing doesn't mean that Harry and Hermione make sense by default. I don't think JKR writes romance very well at all, so I'm quite happy that things ended up as they did.

Please understand that as phrased your comment comes across as quite rude.
