IIRC there was a one-shot where they used the goblet of fire to take away Voldemort's magic, and then it ended with the Death Eaters realizing he lost his magic and couldn't fight them, so they attacked Voldemort.

Aside from something like this, a rebellion would totally fail because, as others have pointed out, he would just kill them all lmao.
