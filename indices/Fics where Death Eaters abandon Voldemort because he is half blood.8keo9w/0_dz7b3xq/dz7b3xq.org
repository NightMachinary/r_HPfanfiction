I feel like that story would end with Voldemort slaughtering most of the renegade Death Eaters and placing the rest on permanent Imperius until he finds some new henchmen. Seriously. A rebellion against the Dark Lord would /not go well/. The man's basically invincible if you're not Dumbledore, Grindelwald, or similar.
