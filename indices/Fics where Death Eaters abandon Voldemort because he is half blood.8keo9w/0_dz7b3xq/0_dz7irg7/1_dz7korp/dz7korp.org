He /was/, but I'm allowing for the fact that 1) Slughorn, Kingsley and McGonagall are more of an unknown to Voldemort than his followers whom he knows very well, 2) this was all happening in the middle of a heated and messy battle where Voldemort also had to deal with Bellatrix's unexpected demise and protecting Nagini, and 3) Harry's sacrificial protection thing was going on, which meant any would-be lethal hits he landed would have been severel downgraded if they worked at all.

Also, you are /way/ overestimating the amount of Death Eaters. At most there may have been 30, 40 Death Eaters in all, and none at the same time; probably less. Now of course, there were also a lot more low-ranking mooks who didn't have official Death Eater status (e.g. the Dark Mark), including the Snatchers and Fenrir Greyback, a lot of whom Voldemort dressed up in Death Eater robes in the Battle of Hogwarts to make his army appear even more fearsome; but these people aren't as loyal to him as the true DEs, few among them who are would be so because of bloodpurism, and few to none of them are decently competent wizards at all.
