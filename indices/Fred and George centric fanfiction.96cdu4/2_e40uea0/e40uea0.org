[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8479548/1/George-Weasley-and-the-Computational-Error][George Weasley and the Computational Error]] by pisoprano. The first chapter is really George being irrational going back in time to attempt to prevent Fred's death. However, as the story progresses it actually becomes a decent read. Overall, the story is a unique read. Plus there's just a lack of Fred and George fics out there even if they are the popular Weasleys. This fic really emphasizes the Twins differences and their bond.
