personally as a drarry fan,, i really like fics that focus on building their friendship before jumping into the relationship so maybe you can focus on like how they start noticing small things about each other that they like and stuff like that.

sorry if i was vague tho it's been a good while since i've read HP fanfic and i'm just tryna get back into it now.
