This one is really sweet and well-written. A wonderful Muggle mum and dad raise Harry, and it features Sirius Black as his godfather/uncle. His Muggle parents aren't super heavily featured, but definitely present for the majority of the story, as is their impact on Harry was he goes through his first year. A very wonderful and charming story.
