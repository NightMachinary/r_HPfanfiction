If you're fine with crossovers, Faded and Vague involves Harry being the Master of Death for millennia, over the course of vampires taking over the world. The crossover is the Vampire Hunter D. I liked the consequences the author showed for Harry having lived so long, and how the author showed Harry dealing with becoming a vampire.
