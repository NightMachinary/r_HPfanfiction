Man, I really need to re-write my fic without Maggie some time, because so many people post here looking for a male OC without a love story and I honestly think I could write Todd Ollivander without the love interest. But I like the love interest, haha! Anyway, here's my story. I'm going to think of others that better fit your request in the meantime.

Not complete but updated regularly. I think you would like all the chapters that I call my "best" that I highlight in my author's note at the top of Chapter One, because the adventure plot is the main focus in those.

EDIT: Also, my one-shot is not a love story (but, y'know, it's only 1,200, words): [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942599/1/Hagrid-s-Umbrella]]

EDIT2: I liked “Goldstein” a lot, though it's very mellow so it's not everyone's cup of tea. No romance plot:
