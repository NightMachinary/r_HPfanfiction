linkffn(8324961) Magical Me by Pubicola is a blatant self-insert, where the writer ends up being transported into Gilderoy Lockhart. Unfortunately, it got left at 16 chapters back in 2015, so that's probably all you'll ever get.

(No, it's not the one where Harry goes back in time and becomes Lockhart, that's a different fic)

Anyway, I enjoyed it enough last time that I'm willing to go through it again. I hope you find it to be fun as well.
