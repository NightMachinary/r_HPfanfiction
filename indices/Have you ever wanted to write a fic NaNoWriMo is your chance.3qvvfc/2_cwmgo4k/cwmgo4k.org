I'm writing a doctor who / hp fanfic called "shadow and chrome" for nanowrimo.

The doctor meets Hermione Granger at a party and is thrilled to meet her . . .until he realizes she's not a witch, has never been to Hogwarts and is continually haunted by dementors. Must be something timey wimey going on!

Hopefully I'll have something workable tobpost at the end of the month.
