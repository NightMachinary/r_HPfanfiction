Mostly offtopic, but there's a free program for writing called [[http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter5.html][yWriter]] which I've discovered recently. I guess it's a lot more basic than Scrivener (I wouldn't know since I haven't used that one) but it has stuff like separation by chapter/scene, word count and progress tracker, and assigning character & location for each scene.

That's not even the reason I started using yWriter though. I was just frustrated with ~10 second startup times of LibreOffice (even on an SSD) when I just want to jot down a few notes. Notepad is okay, but I'd rather have some formatting. yWriter launches in a second so that's pretty cool.
