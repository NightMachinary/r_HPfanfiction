Wow, I am so tired of people downvoting premises they disagree with. Argue against it, but don't just downvote posts to oblivion unless they're obviously trolling or spam.

The point of that smell being in Amortentia is that it /would/ smell like Ginny, and he hasn't realised it until that moment. It smells like other things, not itself. So it's actually canon support for his love being real rather than potion induced.

/Otherwise/, the premise is plausible and your examples do indeed support it. Though they also support an awakening to sexual interest and love as puberty hits. Crushes during puberty are often crazy-strong in any case.

I've obviously ended up siding with it being actual love after an excellent essay I can't find that details why Harry/Ginny is supported all the way from Book One in canon, through his noticing her over others, to shared glances of understanding, to the words used to describe her from Harry's PoV, compared to words used to describe other witches.

However, I won't condemn anyone who decides that the entire thing was cemented with potion later on. Just not with that particular example as support.
