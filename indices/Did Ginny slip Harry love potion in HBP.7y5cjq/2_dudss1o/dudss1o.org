Despite what people on here seem to think, it is possible for 15 year olds to magically start liking someone out of the blue. That's kind of what 15 year olds, and most other teenagers, do. So it really isn't that weird for Harry to like Ginny without there being a three book preamble to their relationship.

And let's be honest, if any of us had access to actual love potions, we would all totally be fantasizing about using them. I for one would be concocting ways to get Tom Hardy or Idris Elba to take some.
