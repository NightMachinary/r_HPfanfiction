1) /Something flowery he might have smelled at the Burrow/. There is the proof that the love potion does smell like Ginny. Love potions smell like your heart's desire. The potion in Weasley's Wizarding Weezes smells flowery to Harry already.

So why is it that you are saying that Ginny smells like love potion, when in Slughorn's class, Harry smells something flowery.

2) JKR was exaggerating teenage hormones. That was not a love potion taking effect.
