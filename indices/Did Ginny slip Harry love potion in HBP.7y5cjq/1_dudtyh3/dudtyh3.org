No. On several levels, this does not make sense: logically, thematically, character-wise and plot-wise. Here are some reasons why not which have not been as of yet mentioned:

• It's against Ginny's personality to do that, especially considering that Ginny knows how it feels to be under control through evil influences, with her experiences with Tom Riddle in /Chamber of Secrets/. Why would she want the one she loves to be controlled, even by her?

• Why was Harry still so much in love with Ginny in /Deathly Hallows/, when they hadn't met for months, such as when he spends hours looking at her dot on the Marauder's Map? Was Ron or Hermione in on the plot? Ron was gone due to the Horcrux, Hermione was crying her eyes out because he was missing. And it wouldn't be in their personality to do this either.

• Ginny was very sceptical of whether Weasley's Wizard Wheezes's love potions were working in /Half-Blood Prince/. Why would she use one if she didn't think they worked?

• It goes against JKR's message about the series and about love in particular. In /Half-Blood Prince/, she very clearly distanced the Merope/Tom (showing a fake relationship that was conditioned by love potion) from Harry/Ginny (showing a relationship with true feelings). Why would JKR promote a relationship, calling them soulmates repeatedly, if it was fake from the start?
