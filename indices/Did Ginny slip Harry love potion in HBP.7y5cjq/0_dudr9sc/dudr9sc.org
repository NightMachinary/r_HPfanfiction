This all has been discussed to death, but quick recap:

- If you chose to interpret it that way, go ahead, I can't stop you

There are easy other explainations:

- Which crushing 15yo girl wouldn't be at least a bit intrigued by love-potions, if only for protection or a daydream?
- Amonortia smells like Ginny because Harry already likes her. JKR also said that Hermione was about to (more or less) say she smells Ron, before she stopped herself.
- Teenage love and jealousy can manifest in many different ways, when I read it "chest monster" was an apt description for my own feelings when I saw my crush going with someone else.

None of these are far-fetched or unlogical, and definitely not harder to justify than the other way.

However, some interpret it differently, but I feel like it doesn't fit in any narrative that Rowling would create.
