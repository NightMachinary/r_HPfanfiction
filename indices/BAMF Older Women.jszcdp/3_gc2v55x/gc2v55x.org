In defense of both the Molly and Sirius situations. There is such a thing as dumb luck and an opponent not taking someone seriously (no pun intended). It's quite possible that Bellatrix did see Molly as nothing more than a housewife so wasn't fighting her at the top of her game. Then add the documented RW fact where a mother has shown incredible feats of strength etc to protect her child. And you could have the situation that in Molly's anger she put way more magic into her spell than she was normally capable of and combine that with Bellatrix not taking the fight seriously and you have Molly with the surprise win.

In Sirius' case he wasn't taking the fight seriously and didn't keep situational awareness and ended up fighting with his "back" to the veil. So once he moved or a spell moved him to touch the veil it was game over.
