Point.

It's fair to say I over-exaggerated for emphasis in my initial post. I made Molly Weasley out to be some boob who didn't know which end of the wand was up. That's not accurate.

I would say a fair evaluation of her level of skill is that she's certainly competent and can hold her own in an attack. But I don't think there's any indication she's at an elite level. Certainly nothing that gives me an indication she'd have a chance in a 1v1 duel with Bellatrix Lestrange.

But anyway, I didn't really start this thread to debate the merits of Molly Weasley so we may be straying a bit far afield.

Any fic recs? I'd certainly love to read an AU fic about covert operations spy Molly Weasley, kicking butt and taking names ;) or anything else you know of that's in-line with the general topic.
