Could you indicate any place to me in the book where Molly Weasley is unambiguously presented as having good offensive/defensive spellwork or good dueling skills at a near elite level?

Maybe I've completely glossed over this. I don't remember anything like that, but if I missed it, I'd love to have it pointed out to me.

And her surviving the first war is great, but surviving the first war doesn't really give us a sense of her skill beyond some basic level. Not everyone in the Order, or Friends of the Order, were awesome at spell casting or duels.

Whereas Bellatrix is specifically presented as several points in the text as very good at duels, the Dark Arts, spellcasting, etc.
