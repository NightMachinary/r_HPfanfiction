This has never stopped getting me angry. If Molly Weasley /must/ kill her, have Bellatrix fending off McGonagall and Kingsley and Molly sneaks around and AK's her in the back.

But a straight up 1 v 1 duel? It's ludicrous, disgusting, and infuriating.

I'm probably angry out of proportion to the offense, but one of my pet peeves is when powerful (usually older) women get completely neutered because the plot suddenly needs them to be stupid/weak. And the main reason it's so infuriating is because they've been built up to be these near-unstoppable BAMFs to begin with. So you really start to like them, and think they're awesome, and then the author decides to take away the very thing you liked because they've become inconvenient to the plot.

Don't get me wrong, there is definitely fiction that deals well with taking these sorts of women down, but it's done through character development and build-up that is present from the beginning. So even though it's tragic, you can see the roots of their eventual defeat starting back when you met the character.

But the far more common approach is to build up these women to be total BAMFs, whose only fatal flaw is plot-driven stupid pills from lazy authors.
