With respect to Molly, how do you know she was untrained? The Books are narrated from Harry's very narrow 3rd person POV. He couldn't possibly know what Molly was doing most of her time.

With all her kids at Hogwarts, Molly didn't have much to do at home anyway, and she had *all the time in the world* to practice and train.

Bellatrix rotted for 15 years in Azkaban. She was only broken out in Jan 1996, and was killed about 2.5 years later.

It appears to me that Molly had a lot more time to train than her, and Molly is older.
