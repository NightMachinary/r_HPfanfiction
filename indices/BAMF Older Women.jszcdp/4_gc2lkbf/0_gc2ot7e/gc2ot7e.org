Well, if you want to take that approach, we could say nearly anything in the book is possible as long as it isn't specifically contradicted by the 3rd person limited narration.

However, HP isn't Finnegan's Wake, you know? At some point, we need to have some confidence that the author is presenting the truth unless indicated otherwise.

Sure, maybe Molly Weasley is the Wizarding Equivalent of an MI6 Officer. It's /possible/. Nothing in the text specifically /excludes/ it. It's the sort of thing that's fun for head canon, and might make a great AU fic, but I don't think that's really a good-faith argument.

If the only way we can have something in the text make sense is by coming up with an elaborate backstory for one of the characters that's not even hinted at in the narrative, then 99% of the time, that's a sign of lazy writing, not elaborate subtext, no?
