  But Bellatrix is defeated via a one-shot kill by Molly Weasley because Molly Weasley is upset. It's like a guy with a sword and shield defeating a machine gun platoon. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Sorry Bellatrix, all your 40 years of training in the Dark Arts is no match for some untrained rando getting angry.

Look, if I were writing DH, I'd give Bellatrix to Hermione, but you have no data to know how skilled Molly Weasly was or wasn't. This notion that it was a one-shot kill isn't even factually accurate, however. It was a fairly lengthy exchange of a large number of rapidly, nonverbally cast spells, something that, for example, late-DH Harry probably couldn't manage:

  ‚ÄòOUT OF MY WAY!' shouted Mrs Weasley to the three girls, and with a swipe of her wand she began to duel. Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly Weasley's wand slashed and twirled, and Bellatrix Lestrange's smile faltered, and became a snarl. Jets of light flew from both wands, the floor around the witches' feet became hot and cracked; both women were fighting to kill.

  ‚ÄòNo!' Mrs Weasley cried, as a few students ran forwards, trying to come to her aid. ‚ÄòGet back! Get back! She is mine!'

  Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two fights, Voldemort and his three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood, invisible, torn between both, wanting to attack and yet to protect, unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent.

  ‚ÄòWhat will happen to your children when I've killed you?' taunted Bellatrix, as mad as her master, capering as Molly's curses danced around her. ‚ÄòWhen Mummy's gone the same way as Freddie?'

  ‚ÄòYou -- will -- never -- touch -- our -- children -- again!' screamed Mrs Weasley.

  Bellatrix laughed, the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he toppled backwards through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen before it did.

  Molly's curse soared beneath Bellatrix's outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart.

So, there you go. Molly could stalemate Bellatrix, then Bellatrix's focus faltered and she died.

What we need in the BAMF Older Women department is more fics showing off Molly.
