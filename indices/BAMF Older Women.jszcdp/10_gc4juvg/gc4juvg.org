Read Chapter 14 of Significant Digits. Actually not even the whole chapter: search to about halfway through, where it says "not one more minute!", then start a paragraph or two earlier.

Bellatrix Lestrange broke out of Azkaban you say? Just broke out? What a yawn. In the chapter above, Hermione Granger literally *destroys* Azkaban.
