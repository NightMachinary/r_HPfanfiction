[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1847346/jlmill9][This author]] used to have all seven books completed, plus a sequel to describe how, and what had changed with the future knowledge. They used to be on FF.net, but sadly, they had to be deleted, because -apparently- a while back there was a great /reading the books/-purge.

I do think they are still on other fanfiction sites, though.
