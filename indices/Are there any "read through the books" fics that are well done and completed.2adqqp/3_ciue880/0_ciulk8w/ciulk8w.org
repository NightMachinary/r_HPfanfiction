I think you misunderstood what OP was asking for. It isn't just a copy-paste of the books. Its someone going back in time and telling the Marauders, or Dumbledore, what happens, or some AU shenanigans happening and them getting a copy of the books.

Snippets from the books might be used, but the focus is more on the reactions of the reader.
