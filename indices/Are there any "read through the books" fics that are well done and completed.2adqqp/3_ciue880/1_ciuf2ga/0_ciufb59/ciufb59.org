These are the types of fics that have literally the entire book copy-pasted in their story with only a few lines of (often very poorly done) "discussion" in between paragraphs.

Fanfiction generally falls under "fair use" and is thus legal (regardless of what the author wants, even pure porn stories about harry Potter are legal) However you cannot just copy the entire work and put it online for free. That's a clear copyright violation.
