I can't help you, sorry, but thank you very much for the squid typo, which has helped me to find and submit another entry for linkffn(Minuets in B Minor) :). I just went to Google and searched for an appropriate misuse of "squid" instead of "squib" in fan fiction until I found a good one. It's fun!
