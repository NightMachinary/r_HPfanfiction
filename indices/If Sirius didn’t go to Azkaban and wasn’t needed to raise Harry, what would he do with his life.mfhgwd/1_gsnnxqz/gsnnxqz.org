Sirius wouldn't necessarily be poor if Regulus survives. His uncle Alphard Black apparently left him a "decent bit of gold" in canon. Also, Sirius is a highly skilled wizard, not an immature womanizer, nor does he run around making stupid jokes all the time. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/anvuxx/fanon_sirius_vs_canon_sirius/?utm_source=amp&utm_medium=&utm_content=post_body][This thread]] sums up the difference between Fanon and Canon Sirius quite well.

An overused but believable option is to make him an Auror. He could also be a DADA Professor and continue the noble work of being a pain in Snape's ass.

  How would he respond to his mother dying soon and *possibly getting the house*?

  But what I really want to know is how he'd make a living *without the fortune*...

How would Sirius inherit the house but not have a fortune?
