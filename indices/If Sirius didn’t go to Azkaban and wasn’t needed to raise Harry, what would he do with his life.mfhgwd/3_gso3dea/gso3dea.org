I think he'd mind his own business. Maybe develop a similar passion as Arthur for Muggle vehicles and enchant them. Honestly I don't think he would become an Auror like most say. That job is over-romanticized by fanon because we see a cool retired Auror in Moody and a really competent one in Kingsley but most of the work (in times of peace) seems to be rather dull and mostly a desk job. I don't think he's the crazy constantly partying womanizer that fanon makes him out to be. Not all pretty boys turn out like that and even if he might have had a phase in his late teens - early twenties... he would get over it.
