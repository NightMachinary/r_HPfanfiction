I've actually read a wolfstar fic like this. An Au in which Remus never went to Hogwarts. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6454192]]) But there is still much to explore. I think he would perhaps be tad less reckless than he is in the books. I think he would want to work something that is fun but he was also said to be very intelligent. He made the map and was an Animagus.

I would always love to see Sirius as a professor in Hogwarts though I don't know if this would be his profession if choice. I think he might be an Auror for a while but I could see him finding that boring after a while (paperwork and rules) so I think he would end up in a profession like Bill, who works as a contracted cursebreaker for Gringotts and raids tombs and stuff.
