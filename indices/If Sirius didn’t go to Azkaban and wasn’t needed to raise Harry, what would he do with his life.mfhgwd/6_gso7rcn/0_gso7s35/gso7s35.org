  Post-Hogwarts, Sirius Black is searching for something, he's just not sure what. James has moved on-married and a newborn baby to content with. So deciding he is going to find out for himself what's out there in the world, he packs up and heads to a Muggle University in San Francisco. There he meets Remus Lupin, the mysterious Teacher's Assistant, who very clearly, has some hidden secrets. At first Sirius wants to sate his curiosity, but eventually finding out what Remus is hiding becomes a near obsession.
