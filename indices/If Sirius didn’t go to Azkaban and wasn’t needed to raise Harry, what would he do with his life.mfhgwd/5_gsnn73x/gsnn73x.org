I think that he would have tried to get into the Auror Corps or be a Hit Wizard.

Alternatively, he might have been disowned by Orion and Walburga, but it doesn't look like Arcturus did (who dies in 1991 IIRC). I find it equally plausible that he could have convinced Sirius to be Heir Black and taught him to politic with the best of them. Although it would take a while; in 1981, SIrius was in full blown rebel mode and probably wouldn't have been too receptive.

Possibly both. And Sirius could be equally charming and provocative, so I could see him having fun in the Wizengamot. And James might then try for a seat like his (great?) grandfather Henry and the two of them would be a real force.

As for money, I believe it is canon that he inherited something from his uncle Alphard, so he could have had enough to get by for a short time (more if you want to go the goblins do the full financial services route). Add to that the elder Potters probably left him something when they died in 1979/80, considering that they took to him so well. One story I read had James' father buying up most of Grimmauld Place and giving all of it to James and Sirius, partly to provide an income and partly to be one in the eye of the Blacks at number 12.

I doubt he would mourn Walburga very much. He might feel her passing as the end of an era, but he would keep it very much to himself. There would be a gap in his life (who is he going to rebel against now?), but ultimately not a negative one. The house and Kreachur would probably go to Regulus between Walburga and Orion's wills. (There has to be at least one other property as there is no indication that Arcturus ever lived there. If Sirius becomes Lord Black or whatever, he'll get that as well as the vaults.)
