Okay I just finished reading it and wow, amazing. I LOVE the characters although i think voldemort turned "nice" abit to fast. Severus is portrayed in a interesting way in this fanfic and you cant stop yourself from becoming attached to him. Great fic, if anyone has knows of any fics that are like this one please let me know!
