One I'm currently reading and really enjoying is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]]. In progress, no pairing (at least as far as I've made it), but HP and LV have a very intense, if not romantic or sexual, relationship, and Snape and Harry see quite a lot of each other. Voldemort has won in the UK in this fic, but as Harry is growing up LV is setting his sights on the rest of Europe, so there's more conflict to come. Not sure if this is what you're after or not, but I hope you enjoy it.
