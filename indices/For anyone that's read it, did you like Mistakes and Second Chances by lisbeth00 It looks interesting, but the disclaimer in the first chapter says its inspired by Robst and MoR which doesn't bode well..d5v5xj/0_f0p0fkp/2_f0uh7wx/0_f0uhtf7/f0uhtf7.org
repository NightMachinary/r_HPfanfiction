They weren't inspired by it, but they definitely had an effect on my early writing for the story.

I had no idea what was popular or 'wanted' - so to say - so I looked at what had topped the charts over the years and used it as a foundation for my story.

Essentially, I used it to prop up the story I created without knowing any better, but I quickly realized after reading more and more stories that it wasn't the wisest choice.

Afterwards I did my best to rectify it with an extensive edit of my already posted chapters, setting up later plot points that I utilized to subvert or explain the overuse of tropes at the beginning, while trying to ignore the ones that I couldn't reasonably work into the later plot in a reasonable manner.
