Heya! This is the writer.

So, that disclaimer I put up on the first chapter was my way of saying "This is what I had assumed to be enjoyed and popular, and quickly realized is not."

I had begun writing that fic very soon after getting into fanfiction as a whole, and all I had read thus far had been stories along those lines.

About twelve, maybe thirteen chapters in I realized what a horrible mistake (haha) I had made and did my damndest to pull away from that mess.

If you have no interest in reading the silly, shitty portion of the story, there's a big ol' self deprecating summary to help you bypass the bad.

I'd like to think my story is worth reading, but I'm not going to be hurt if you don't enjoy it.
