I read it last year and remember being pretty obsessed about it. I'm actually stoked as /hell/ to see that it is updating :-D

It starts dark, stays dark and gets darker at times. Engage the safeties on every trigger you have, maybe have a whisky and it can be great fun.

So yeah, I recommend it heartily. In fact, I'm gonna put down my current book to re-read this heavy bastard along with you.

Edit: So I caught up with the final chapter and preeeetty much stand by my comments. It has some slow and rough spots between chapters 4 and 12
