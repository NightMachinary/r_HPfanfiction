In the begining it has a lot of tropes (Manipulative!Dumbledore, Maste of Death stuff, etc) but it gets a lot better and if you're a fan of new and powerful Magic being introduced then this story is definitely for you. And in my opinion it has nothing to do with Robst besides using a few of the tropes that he has also used (but are now used in probably over half of AU stories). It does have a Fem!Harry and a Fem!Slash pairing, though that should be obvous from the summary I think.

PS: When I read the first chapters I had feared that it would end up being a weird transgender/ Male in female body type story, but luckily Harrys gender change is accepted easily by her and it doesn't lead to massive drama, so you're okay if you feared that, which you probably didn't anyway xD

So all in all I would say a decent story. Certainly readable and enjoyable.
