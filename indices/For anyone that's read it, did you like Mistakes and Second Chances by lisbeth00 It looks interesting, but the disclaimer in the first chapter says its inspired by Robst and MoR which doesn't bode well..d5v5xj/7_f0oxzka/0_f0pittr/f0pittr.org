I dunno, I get it. Both are filled with overindulgence. Of course this is fanfiction, so it doesn't really matter.

Robst does it the safest way by writing essentially the same thing over and over again with different scenarios.

MoR does it with technical explanation and characterization (issue is I don't enjoy either in this story).
