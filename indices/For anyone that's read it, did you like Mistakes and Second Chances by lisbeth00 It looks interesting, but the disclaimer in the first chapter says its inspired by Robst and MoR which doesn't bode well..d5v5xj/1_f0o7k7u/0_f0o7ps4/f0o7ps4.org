I could, but I'd rather ask people. That's part of the point of having a community. I can benefit from the people that have come across it before me and get their opinions. Whenever I come across a story that ends up being shit but that I'm interested in reading, I end up wasting at least a day of reading time figuring it out. It will be easier and quicker to just have people to tell me it's a waste of time if it's terrible.
