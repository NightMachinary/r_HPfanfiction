linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) Harry, Hermione, and ron are all sorted into Slytherin. Harry took refuge from Dudley in the library, Ron embraced his chess skills, and Hermione had an encounter with the supernatural before Hogwarts. Lots of original Worldbuilding. (Also, Harry met Blaise rather than Draco at Madam Malkins, and Snape gave him his introduction to the magical world.)
