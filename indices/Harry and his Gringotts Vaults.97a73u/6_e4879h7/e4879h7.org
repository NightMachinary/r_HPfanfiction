One of the biggest things to also keep in mind is How much is a galleon worth, both in the wizard and muggle world.

There's no point in saying Harry has exactly 5 million galleons if galleon means nothing to us. I would personally assume galleons are pure gold and worth ~$200. Muggle anyways. But then it seems to cost a few thousand dollars for textbooks and school supplies?
