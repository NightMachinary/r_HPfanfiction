So, from a purely fanon perspective, there are a few things to consider. Obviously, JKR sucks at numbers and loves to pander to fans and retcon things she's forgotten about, etc.

A) Enough to where it's not something that Harry needs to worry about. Or rather, enough to where the reader doesn't need to keep a running tally. Putting an actual number is a fool's errand, and it'll never be right.

B) I personally don't see the need for a second vault. If his first vault already has as much as he needs, does he need two vaults with as much as he needs?

C) This is an interesting discussion. On one hand, we see the Malfoys keeping all of their dark heirlooms hidden in their own manorr. On the other, we see the Lestranges hoarding a bunch of treasure in Gringotts. Part of me is curious as to what if there's another Goblin war. I feel like there's probably a line that separates something from being a vault and being a self-serve storage facility.

D) Probably. James's Parents had to have lived somewhere before they died. Sirius even lived with them for a bit. So there is likely that property, as well as the one in Godric's Hallow.

E) My headcanon is that most of the money was squandered, and a large portion of the remaining was spent on Harry's Firebolt. Or is that canon?

F) Probably. I don't think Bellatrix/Narcissa/Andromeda grew up at grimmauld place, so that's another location. And then there's got to be others for Arcturus and all the other grandparents. There's a lot of them. As for businesses and such, we can only speculate.

H) In canon, it's free. But that does open up a whole load of other questions, doesn't it? How do the teachers and other staff get paid? If the Ministry pays for it, where does their money come from? Solely from taxes? Taxes from whom? Surely not muggleborn families, and I don't picture someone like the Malfoys paying taxes. How do they generate any significant amount of money to pay all the workers the Ministry has considering how cheap everything is? And, if the Ministry is paying for all the students to go to Hogwarts, how can anyone complain about them "interfering at Hogwarts" when they're footing the bill for every last one of them? Personally, I prefer there to be a tuition cost. It's an easier, simpler explanation that doesn't take much to work.

I) Harry doesn't receive any mail at all, until his Hogwarts letter. Not a single piece of fan mail, gift, or advertisement. Kind of strange.

J) Probably just have to file claim and prove your identity, if there's something extant for some reason. If there's only one vault Harry already likely has everything already, even if he's not aware of it.

K) I doubt it. Maybe if there was some actual paperwork filled out, but I feel like that scene wasn't written with indepth analysis in mind.

I) Probably not much. Newspaper isn't that much, and it seem like there's no wizarding equivalents of vending machines in the castle. So that leaves sporadic owl orders, christmas shopping, and Hogsmede trips. Like, we see Ron make it through the year, and he barely has any money at all.

Your assumptions: What does being an old/noble/whatever house really mean? I don't think it really means anything. After all, it can take twenty generations to build up wealth, but it can be spent in one. If you just have these guys doing nothing but sitting in manors all day while funding war efforts, with no money coming in, the money won't last. And, if they do have money coming in, from where? How are people like the Malfoy's millionaires when there's just not that much money to go around. What is the value of money to a wizard anyways? There's a lot of questions that don't really have good answers.
