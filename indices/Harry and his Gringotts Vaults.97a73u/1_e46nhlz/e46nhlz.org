A few very important things:

- There are no such things as inherently wealthy Ancient and Noble Families. The Blacks are basically the only ones who claimed to be "noble", though the modern Malfoy may think along the same lines. The rest aren't particularly wealthy, just... wealthy, and there are as many rich half-bloods and Muggle-borns as rich pure-bloods, it's just that the pure-bloods use it for bribing more often.

- There is no "main" Potter vault separate from the "trust vault". Harry's vault /is/ the Potter vault. And it contains insane amounts of money. In Muggle terms, I would say that Harry would probably be a millionaire... but not a multimillionaire. From then, the figure in Galleons depends on what exchange rate you're using; the canon one is about five pounds to a Galleon, but some headcanons place it as high as fifty pounds to a Galleon. You make the conversions.

- There /is/ no Hogwarts tuition. You have to buy your robes and books and /that's it/. Rowling has explicitly said that the Ministry pays for Hogwarts. How else do you suppose destitute Tom Riddle & Co. would have managed it?

- An easy answer for i) is that Dumbledore expected Petunia to have known through Lily and to tell Harry as a matter of common decency. Dumbledore knew the Dursleys were /unpleasant/, but refused to believe that they would be quite as abusive as they turned out to be, and was as flabbergasted as Hagrid when he learned they hadn't even told him magic was real --- though it would not have surprised him for them to keep his Boy-Who-Lived status quiet, and he thought /that/ was rather a good thing.

- Harry being placed with the Dursleys was a decision Dumbledore was forced to make, which suggests, to me that, that if there /was/ a last will and testament that named a guardian for Harry, it named Sirius as first possibility, and Peter if unavailable. One being convicted and the other dead (as far as anyone knows). So no, I don't think the Dursleys received any money. Possibly Dumbledore wrote to them that he would help them financially if needed, but, naturally, the bigots refused to get any wizard money, even if it was only to embezzle it.

Concerning l), I would say, not much for the first few years. I expect many don't /have/ spending money. /Where/ would they spend it, except for the Hogwarts Express? Of course, this changes past Third-Year with the Hogsmeade Weekends, and there I suspect they'd get the same varied lot as regular Muggle kids do.

Concerning f): I'm going to say... not really. They might at one time, but they probably sold them all, or nearly so, over the years to get more money to bribe their way out of court cases and, later, support Voldemort financially.
