  Muggleborns don't have this luxury, they enter the Wizarding World with nothing

It all depends on the exchange rate from Pound to Galleon. If we stick by the 5 to 1 in canon, then some Muggleborns could be a lot richer than Purebloods:

- In GOF, 1000 Galleons were considered big money in Wizarding world. The Twins were able to own a shop in Magical Britain's prime shopping district. But in 1990s Muggle London, 5000 Pounds might get you 3 months rent in an upscale location. Nowadays, it's probably worth one month rent.
- Hermione Granger's house was [[https://mashable.com/2016/09/26/hermione-granger-house-for-sale-harry-potter/#I68W71hjGmqn][sold for 2.4 million Pound in 2016]], or 480000 Galleons. Her parents were only dentists and upper middle class.
- Muggleborns from truly rich Muggle families (corporate executives, hereditary nobilities, successful entrepreneurs) could easily out snob rich Purebloods, if they were allowed free Pound to Galleon exchanges.

Therefore, if I were to design my own world, I would have Goblins charge an exorbitant bid and ask spread when it came to Pound/Galleon exchange rates:

- For anyone exchanging Galleons into Pounds, the rate would be indeed 5.
- For anyone exchanging Pounds into Galleons, the rate would be 5 up to a certain (small) amount, the rate for anything above that amount would be the prevailing Pound price for 1 Oz of Gold. In the 1990s, that would be 200. Today, it's about 1000.
