I think it should be noted that most of the Muggleborns (for whom its discussed) seem to come from well-off families. Hermione's parents' are dentists, which means anything from a middle class income to pretty rich, and her own intelligence makes it likely that her environment growing up (nurture) encouraged studying and other traits that are simply easier for rich students. Justin mentions being on the books for Eton at one point, which means he would have been going to a posh, expensive, public boarding school. Muggles are even more likely to have generational wealth- we see businesses and real estate in the wizarding world (that are presumably funded by patrons), but it's not really clear that Gringotts has "investments" per se, so common muggle intergenerational investment vehicles (stocks) don't exist.

The one concession for wizards is that they're still in a post-scarcity society. Theoretically, no wizard should ever be desperately in need of food+shelter due to what they can create through magic, yet somehow seedy places and wizards still exist, and the Weasley's monetary circumstances are mentioned a couple times.
