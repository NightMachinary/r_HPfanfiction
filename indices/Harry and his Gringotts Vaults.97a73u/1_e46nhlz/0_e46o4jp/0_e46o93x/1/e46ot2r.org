No property, no heirlooms, no knowledge of how the world works. The 11 years where they are unaware of magic will hurt them later in life, it is folly to suggest that this does not make a difference in future successes. Can you imagine not going to kindergarten until age 11? How much a disadvantage you would be at? This has financial implications.

We also have another thing to consider: the implication that muggleborns may not have equal employment opportunities, further widening the gap financially. Arthur Weasley, a man completely unqualified for his position is a Department Head. It certainly isn't because of his ability, but more than likely his blood.

Just as there is racial inequality when it comes to wealth, blood purity would have the same issues.
