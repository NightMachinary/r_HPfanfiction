The muggleborn are still going to school and getting an education. Most of the stuff you learn in early grades isn't important in terms of the specific content, what's important is the structure and the use of a school as an agent of socialization, forcing you to interact with peers and learn social norms. Muggleborns may struggle to write with quills and lack the background in terms of parables about magic, but they still would know how to read, write, and generally interact with peers.
