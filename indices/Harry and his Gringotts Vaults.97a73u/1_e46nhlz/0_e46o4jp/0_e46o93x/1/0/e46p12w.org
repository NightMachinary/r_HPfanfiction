  Arthur Weasley, a man completely unqualified for his position is a Department Head. It certainly isn't because of his ability, but more than likely his blood.

He's quite qualified for his position, thank you very much. He isn't there to understand how Muggle objects work, he's there to make sure Dark Wizards don't curse them for giggles, and he's proven to be quite knowledgeable about the ins and outs of enchanting Muggle objects (/cough/ Ford Anglia /cough/). And besides, the people who would discriminate against Muggle-borns would be equally reticent to see a blatantly Muggle-friendly "blood traitor" like Weasley take the job.

  Can you imagine not going to kindergarten until age 11? How much a disadvantage you would be at? This has financial implications.

Okay, so all that's about Muggle-borns. I'm not entirely convinced, but it /is/ a fair argument. However, what would disadvantage half-bloods, of any type, in relation to pure-bloods? Before you bring up the employment issue again, while there may be /some/ occasional discrimination in the Ministry, a Ministry career is far from one's only option (it's only about a third of the population by most estimates), and besides, it can't be any more blatant than racist discrimination in /Muggle/ British government. Blood-purism may have many closet adherents before the Second War but it's still very much "politically incorrect" in the Wizarding World.

Note, as [[/u/Taure]] has pointed out somewhere, how Lucius takes care not to say anything against Muggle-borns in front of Minister Fudge, not because Fudge would really disagree (he's a bit of a blood-purist himself, we later learn), but because it's not proper to say so in public and would kill Lucius's public image as a philanthropist.
