  Someone who has lived as a muggle, who knows what a toaster, refrigerator, and lawn mower both do and how to use them would be far more qualified

AW is head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts division, not the Use of Muggle devices. He doesn't need to know what a lawn mower's primary use. He does know, however, that a lawn mower that can fire is clearly something to be confiscated and removed from the public. And like, [[/u/Achille-Talon][u/Achille-Talon]] said, he's very good at enchanting, as we see from the car that can fly. I'd say he's nearly as skilled as Sirius is at enchanting, with the added advantage that AW didn't spend a decade in Azkaban which he no doubt used to further his skills.
