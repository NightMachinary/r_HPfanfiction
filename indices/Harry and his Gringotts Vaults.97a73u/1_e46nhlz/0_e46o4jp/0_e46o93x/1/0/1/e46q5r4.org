Another important thing to remember that due to the small size of the Wizarding World, who you know is almost as important as what you know. Nepotism abounds in this environment, political and social connections are something a muggleborn would not have.

Arthur Weasley may be qualified for a pureblood but compared to a muggleborn? Someone who has lived as a muggle, who knows what a toaster, refrigerator, and lawn mower both do and how to use them would be far more qualified. Blood has at least some impact upon his obtaining this position.

It depends on a case by case basis for halfbloods. Those like Harry who are muggle raised would be at a large disadvantage. In the end how you are raised (wizard/muggle) will have the biggest impact on your future success and financial opportunities.
