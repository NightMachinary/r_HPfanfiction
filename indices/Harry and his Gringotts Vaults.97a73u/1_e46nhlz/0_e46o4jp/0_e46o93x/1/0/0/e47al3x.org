I don't think starting magical education until 11 is a huge disadvantage. I think getting a thorough Muggle education for 11 years is a huge advantage. It's not like magical children are being taught spells at home or else we'd see Ron be able to do something as simple as float a feather on his very first try. All they know is that it's real and they see their parents do it every day.

Now, what we don't know is how magical children acquire written language, math and reasoning skills. Are they homeschooled? Do they go to the village school? Private tutors? Magical family educational co-op? So you have a Muggleborn who's gone to school, learned to read, write an essay, do math and think critically put into a school where there can quite reasonably be several children who've never heard of an essay and might not even be able to spell "cat". I'd say Advantage Muggleborn right there. In addition to learning things, being in a school prepares you /to/ learn and to learn effectively and I don't feel like non-muggleborns are really prepared for that very well.

The books have shown us that children raised in the magical environment do not have any sort of leg up on magic than their non-magically raised counterparts.
