  Muggleborns don't have this luxury, they enter the Wizarding World with nothing

Why? Is there a "please deposit all your money upon entering" booth by the Leaky Cauldron? Muggle-borns are as likely to be born to a wealthy family as wizards, you know. I'd be surprised if the Grangers were anything short of upper-middle-class, being both dentists, for example. Hermione is no Draco but I imagine she may very well be as rich as, say, Pansy.

Far from all wizards are rich, far from all Muggles are poor.
