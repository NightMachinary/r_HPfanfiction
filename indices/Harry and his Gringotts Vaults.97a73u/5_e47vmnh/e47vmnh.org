When talking about money, I like to have an idea of the value of currency. Official exchange rate was £5 to ¤1, but things seem to vary wildly. I'd go ¤400/year as a reasonable starting salary without special qualifications. A newspaper is a couple knuts. Dinner out is a sickle or two.

  How much money is it reasonable to say Harry has in his trust vault?
#+end_quote

Money is power. You need to pick how you want power arranged in your fic. You need to decide how you want each type of power to impact the main conflict. You can write a story in which Harry's main focus is attacking the logistics and supply side of Voldemort's operations. In that case, money would be a big part of the story, and while you'd need to give Harry a lot, you'd have to make sure it isn't enough to trivialize the conflict.

Unless you're going for a cash-based roflstomp.

  How much would Hogwarts tuition be?
#+end_quote

According to Rowling interviews, it's free. In canon, it's just not mentioned, so you can set it to whatever makes sense. Hogwarts is implied to be the best school in the UK, not the only one, but there are still slacker students, and all seven Weasley kids got in. That's a bit weird if there are skill-based requirements. But if it's just money, then you could say that Arthur Weasley has a good salary as a Ministry department head, and he and Molly chose to spend it all on their kids' education.

  What other things might be included in the Potter family vault?
#+end_quote

If they have a Potter Manor, then not much. Legal documents rather than personal effects. If there's no Potter Manor, they'll have portraits and artifacts in the vault. Letters from James and Lily.

  What is the process like for getting your inheritance? Do you have to be a certain age? Are there special processes for folks like Harry, last of their lines?
#+end_quote

Presumably adulthood is a prerequisite. That would be a sensible way to arrange it. Or slowly increasing access over time, starting at adulthood. Or starting at an age later than adulthood.

Cue a story arc on how Harry uses shenanigans to gain early access. It would take skill to make that work in a story.

  Would the Dursleys have been receiving money for Harry's upkeep from either Dumbledore or Gringotts (presumably as designated by the Potters' last will and testaments)
#+end_quote

That's a tired trope intended to make the Dursleys seem even more evil and ungrateful. I'd avoid it somehow. Either have them actually be grateful (and better disposed toward Harry as a consequence), or don't give them a stipend.
