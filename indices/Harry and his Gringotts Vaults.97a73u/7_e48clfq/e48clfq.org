The Potter universe makes from a financiel and economic standpoint no sense at all. Same goes for the size of the population.

My personal opinion is to make the whole inheritance story work we first have to assume that Wizarding Brittian has a devide between the upper and lower class. Like the one the real UK had up until the WWI. This means some families are actually incredibly rich while others are just barely getting by. Malfoy vs Weasley. Base your story on the economic situation of the 1800s UK otherwise it makes no sense at all and it fits nicely in the narrative of classism thatis in HP.

Note that the canon exchange rate is 5 pounds to a Gallon. That is ridiculous that would put a wand (the most important magical object) at the price of a dvd box. It also begs the question why Ron was stuck with an old wand? No the price of a Wand should be more like a months salary to make sense.

a. The awnser is NOT THAT MUCH. A classic rich family keeps the money in the Estate while a small stipened is given out to family members. If harries vault is a "trust vault" it just covers tutition school supplies and spending money for all seven years plus some extra.

Important note! Some fics have the vault automaticallly refill from the Potter vault each year. This makes no sense if its a trust vault a trust if for LIMITED spending refilling endlessly does not serve that purpsoe. This only would work if the vault contains money for 1 years expenses each year.

b. a lot more but not that much more but no crazy amount all. (see D)

c. Some objects like the vault they visit in book 7.

d. Yes assuming its a class based society like the UK was the should have rather large immovable properties that provide a stable passive income. NOT owning half of Diagon alley and the Blacks owning the whole of knokturn alley. That creates a ridiculour powerdynamic that ruins every fic. No but magical products need to come from somewhere magical plants and animals need to live somewhere out of muggle eyes..... It would only be logical if that would be on wizard owned lands.

e. The blacks seem like a family in decline. So it can go eitherway

f. Same like last question

h. Canon says the ministery pays. It seems far more logical to have that be a private school. Paid for by a rather large tuition. Otherwise why would it be that prestigous?

i. Harry is an uninterested little shit. Thats canon! Why people didn't tell him? You don't talk about money the older your money the less you talk about it.

j. No. You get your inheretence immediatly when your parents die. But mostly underage children dont get the right to spend unlimited money. There is a trustee and executionor of the will to take care of that. Why they dont contact harry at 11? Because a child has no bussiness with the estate until he turns of age. Harry has in this scenario a trustvault. Trusts exist to keep people away from the family estate.

k. Most likely a small stipened and ofcourse child support from the goverment.

L. Some but not much. The first two years have no chance to spend any. Third year and up enough to go to hogsmeade.

I would expect more school and a higher population to make any of the HP universe work in any realistic sense. The small Hogwarts student body and the fact that there is only 1 wizarding school makes it easy to write but it makes no sense.
