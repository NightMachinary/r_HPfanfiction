  500 galleons max, considering 1 Galleon is enough to buy school supplies for 5 people (Including expensive Lockhart's books)

Sorry, but I'm downvoting for that. Rowling has stated that a Galleon is about five pounds, give or take. Yes, we all know she can't do math, but you can't argue with the canon evidence, regardless. All we can conclude from what you note is that school supplies are /very cheap/ in the Wizarding World, not that Galleons are very expensive.
