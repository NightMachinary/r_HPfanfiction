  How so? When are you supposed to downvote something in a discussion, if not when you think that the comment in question is ill-thought-out/wrong? What's the point of downvoting then?
#+end_quote

That applies in forums. Reddit says this about downvoting:

#+begin_quote
  If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.

  That comes down to different standards of canon, then, I suppose. But to me and quite a few others, interviews and Pottermore are as canon as the books (with supplementary material like cards, video games, movies, etc. a notch below).

Fair enough. I guess then we agree to disagree on this topic.
