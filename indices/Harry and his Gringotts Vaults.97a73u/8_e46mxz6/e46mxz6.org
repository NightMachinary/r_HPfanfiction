#+begin_quote
  How much money is it reasonable to say Harry has in his trust vault?
#+end_quote

500 galleons max, considering 1 Galleon is enough to buy school supplies for 5 people (Including expensive Lockhart's books)

#+begin_quote
  How much money is it reasonable to say is in the Potter family vault?
#+end_quote

1k max, same reasons.

#+begin_quote
  What other things might be included in the Potter family vault?
#+end_quote

Portraits, old furniture, anything you'd put in an attic.

#+begin_quote
  Is it reasonable to assume that the Potter family still owns property?
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  How much money do you think Harry inherited from Sirius?
#+end_quote

~500 galleons

#+begin_quote
  Would the Black family have had lots of properties?
#+end_quote

Yes, due to the Wizarding World economy, property would show you're rich, therefore they likely had at least a couple properties.

Assuming, of course, we are talking about buildings.

#+begin_quote
  How much would Hogwarts tuition be?
#+end_quote

Canonically it is free.

#+begin_quote
  What are ways to justify Harry not knowing about family vaults and properties?
#+end_quote

Everyone assumed he had known. Dumbledore forgot to tell him, and Hagrid is not reliable.

#+begin_quote
  What is the process like for getting your inheritance? Do you have to be a certain age?
#+end_quote

Legal age.

#+begin_quote
  Are there special processes for folks like Harry, last of their lines?
#+end_quote

In the muggle world, yes. Wizarding? Up to you.

#+begin_quote
  Would the Dursleys have been receiving money for Harry's upkeep from either Dumbledore or Gringotts (presumably as designated by the Potters' last will and testaments)
#+end_quote

Probably not. Wizards live life differently then muggles do. Wizards don't need to starve, food is easy to get and cheap, whilst muggles do starve if they have no money (assuming they don't steal).

So wizards might forget that muggles live differently.

#+begin_quote
  How much spending money is the average Hogwarts student likely to have?
#+end_quote

5-10 galleons.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe there's nothing left of the Potter family vaults/properties because they sold them for funding for the Order.
#+end_quote

Wizards have little need for money. Wars could reasonably be fought without a knut in your pocket. Us muggles can't do that.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe various properties/monies were given away/spent as part of various marriages over the years.
#+end_quote

Doubtful, properties are one of the few things in the Wizarding world that is very valuable.
