What [[/u/AutumnSouls]] said. It's a simple fact that that bit of reddit's original rules is pretty much forgotten at this point; people naturally gravitate to downvoting what they think is foolish or ill-thought-out or wrong, as opposed to just trolling, and at this point it's not the people that are in the wrong, it's the books that need updating.

What /should/ remain banned are attacks /ad hominem/ --- downvoting a comment just because you don't like its author, downvoting a sound argument because you don't like the conclusions. But if a comment is misinformed (and thereby spreads misinformation) or its reasoning is flawed, I think it's perfectly reasonable to argue that it should be downvoted.

Such is the common law of this sub, whether you like it or not, and it sincerely won't do you any good to gripe about it. You mention that "this is how it is in forums"; well then just accept that [[/r/HPfanfiction]] works like one of those forums and move on. It's not like such forums are inherently broken and dysfunctional, is it? Our community itself is holding up pretty well.
