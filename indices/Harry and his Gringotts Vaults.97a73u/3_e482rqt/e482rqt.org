There are many holes in JK worldbuilding, things she should have thought but did not, but does not extract from the story and I think fandom does answer some questions quite naturally and logically, so it does not bother me much.

This being said, the wizarding world is /small/, so their economy is also small, especially if compared to non magical. Old, pure blood families could be actually /quite rich/ if you consider:

1)valuable metals as gold and silver are used by both magical and non magicals;

2)old families tend to be conservative in her dealings and nobles are expected NOT to squander what they have inherited, but if possible, to add to their families fortunes;

3) old and large families usually have Estates large enough to house Cottages and other dwellings for ther excess of heirs and land, usually, is an expensive commodity.

4) magical artifacts and family heirlrooms must have quite a value, right?

So, I assume families like Malfoys and Blacks were indeed /multimillionaires/ and had always been; the problem is, non magical economy has expanded and diversified to such a degree in the last cenetury that made this kind of wealth obsolete. Therefore, there is simple no way you can compare a Malfoy with a Jeff Bezos in terms of wealth alone and I guess it is not even this point.

Grimmauld Place is clearly the Blacks /urban/ residence; they are indeed Ancient and most Noble, so they should have land. Period. We know that the Malfoys are noble because they build a Manor in land given to them by King William, meaning they were landowners during a time where only nobles have this privelege.

The Potters, were are told, wree rich, and became even richer when they invented Sleakeasy; it is stated that Harry indeed has a vaut filled with gold and the family has lived in Godrick´s Hollow for centuries. I assume they are not nobles in the sense the Malfoys and Blacks are, but are rather respected members of the wizarding society. James father was a talented businessman, but he sold the sleakeasy and retired; then I assume there was indeed lots of gold in their vaults, but I also suspect that James, not being the "C.E.O" type of guy and because they were living at war, he might have willingly used some of his gold to help the cause.

Frankly, I cannot see Dumbledore being practical enough to offer the Dursleys some gold to help support Harry. I believe it is part of their ressentment and a reason why Harry was forced to be their servant and use hand me downs. The truth is- and I am not bashing- Dumbledore wanted Harry to survive and be protected by the blood wards. He was wearing many hats and I do not thik for a second he would have the common sense to have worked an extra official agreement with the Durleys. He could have, for instance, Hagrid dopping by a couple of timer per year to deliver the Dursleys some mone and see Harry´s living conditions, which again is fucking common sense in such cases, but he opted to have the cat lady just making sure that Harry was alive.

So, all in all, I do not think that Dumbledore is on purpose keeping the Potter´s wealth from Harry, or, as some fanfic suggest, stealing from Harry; I think Dumbledore considered his job "done" by providing Harry with a secure home and leaving the Potter´s vaults flled with gold.

Another reason for that is James and Lily´s will: rich families make wills. /Period/. Add that the war climate and the fact that Harry had no magical obvious next of kin and the will is not only a possibility, but a given. It could very well be that Dumbledore had Harry dropped at the Durleys and ignored the Potter´s will for securiyt reasons, and that he simply dd not offer gold from the Potter´s vaults not to draw attention to the fact that he was disrespecting the will. With Sirius and the Longbottons unable to care for Harry, Dumbledore indeed had many reasons to consider Petunia the best option, but she was defonetely not the only option.

So, yes, everything point out to the fact that Dumbledore simply did not think much about the repercutions of having Harry with Petunia ( Harry growing up not knowing about wizards; Durleys being forced not only to be guardians to Harry but also to support hem; not to mention, Petunia and Vernon being absolutely scared about anything magical and having been told they had no other choise than to be saddled with Harry) and assumed too much ( that Petunia would come to care for Harry solely based on their close relation and that the Dursleys would guide Harry into the more practical side of things, like how to deal with money, for example).

In conclusion, Potters are wealthy, but possibly not noble as Malfoys; Dumbledore merely did not care about such details as a loving and caring environment and the costs of raising a child when he decided to have Harry at the Durleys, and , finally, the vaults were still filled with gold by the time Harry could have the gold, but the boy had already been raised as a pauper, so it made not much difference.
