Potter is a trust fund jock who grows up to be a cop.

He's also... well, he's not dumb, and he's not oblivious, but he... doesn't have a ton of imagination, let's say?

He's not the sort of kid to wonder about where his money comes from, how is it being managed, who else has money, etc. All he really knows is "I'm rich and vaguely embarrassed about it," and doesn't pursue it much beyond that.
