The public does not get to decide upon "justice". Harry was brought before the Wizengamot for a trial, not in the court of public opinion. The ministry deals justice not the masses.

No one is arguing the Death Eaters were bad guys.

I agree that this should happen, but the fact of the matter the ministry is not going to do these things. The very fact that the Malfoys escape justice is proof of this. Lucius did not defect. Draco did not defect. Both of these were Death Eaters until the bitter end and neither received any form of justice. If an inner circle member such as Lucius escapes justice, than a low level thug certainly will.
