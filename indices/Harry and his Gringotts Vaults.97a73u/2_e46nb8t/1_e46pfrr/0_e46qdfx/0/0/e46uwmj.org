  Lucius did not defect. Draco did not defect.

Yes they did. Lucius did it only once it profited him and probably never had a /moral/ redemption, but IIRC he did end up helping the Ministry, fighting the last few renegade Death Eaters post-war. As for Draco, it's clear from /Cursed Child/ and interviews that Rowling clearly thinks he outgrew the savage blood-purism of the Death Eaters for which he had never really been cut out, and, as a grown-up, was a pretty decent bloke.

The Malfoys, for right or ill, also had Harry's support due to Narcissa's part in saving him and his general forgiving nature. The same could not be said of other Death Eaters, whether high- or low-ranking.
