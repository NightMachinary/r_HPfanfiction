I think you are missing the point. Harry (and Hermione now I guess?) do not have the power to do these things. They do not get to unilaterally decide the fate of the defeated. That authority lies with the governing body of Magical Britain, that being the ministry. The ministry is not competent enough to strike against them.

Harry does not have the authority to act in such a way. He is not judge, jury, and executioner. He is not a member of the Wizengamot, nor is he the minister. He does not hold the power to do these things you think he can.

Harry in canon is passive, he only responds to threats. Harry does not go out seeking to make war or enemies. He merely just wants to be ordinary; that's all he has ever wanted.
