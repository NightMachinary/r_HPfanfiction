Well, Harry killed someone as early as 11. In the flight of 7 Potters, he blasted quite a few Death Eaters off their brooms.

Furthermore, you seem to buy the theory that Voldemort remnants still managed to hang onto power miraculously, after the Dark Lord himself, the Death Eater army, and Ministry's own security force all got destroyed at Hogwarts. You still seem to think that a government fallen twice within ten months should have authority.

You are wrong. The center of power would shift to those who had defeated Voldemort and his minions in an armed conflict. The Ministry was nothing but a pathetic laughing stock.
