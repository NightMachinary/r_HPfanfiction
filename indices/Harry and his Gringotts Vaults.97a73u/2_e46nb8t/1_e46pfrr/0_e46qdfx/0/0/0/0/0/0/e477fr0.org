Actually, DA and enraged parents of Hogwarts students would be far more enthusiastic in dishing out extreme punishments against Voldemort sympathizers.

Magical Britain also didn't have that aversion to death penalties and cruel punishments like Muggle UK. The big winners of the War, the Boneses, the Longbottoms, the Shacklebolts, the Tonkses, and the Weasleys had suffered greatly and should be hell bent on exacting retributions against their enemies. They would have little trouble get the rest of the populace riled up, too.

I think Harry and Hermione could actually be a moderating force on the bloodlust of their friends and families. But Harry was already crucioing Amycus Carrow for spitting on McGonagall (who was fine with this BTW), so I doubt his mercy would extend very far. Hermione, being brutally tortured by Bellatrix, should also be out for blood if her action against Rita Skeeter was any guide. Ginny would thoroughly beat up Zach Smith for simply annoying her, so what do you think she would do to those who tortured her and murdered her friends?
