The big winners of the first Wizarding War did nothing to the remaining Death Eaters. They returned to Wizarding Society without even a slap on the wrist. If this truly was to happen in Wizarding Britain /then why didn't it happen after the first War?/

This leads us to one of two conclusions:

1. They wanted to punish them but did not have the power/authority to do so.
2. They were content to allow them to return to society after Voldemort's demise to a child

If #1 is true, which is in my opinion the more likely scenario, then nothing would change as I have said before they have no power to do so.

The DA does not rule Britain, nor does it have the power to sentence criminals, that as I have said before lies with the governing body of Wizarding Britain. /They have no power to do these things even if they want to./ Public opinion means little to those in power.

And yet Harry never once kills anyone, even though he would be justified in doing so. Hermione and Harry combine for a total of zero deaths. Zero. /If they are not willing to kill in a time of war why would you think they would in a time of peace?/
