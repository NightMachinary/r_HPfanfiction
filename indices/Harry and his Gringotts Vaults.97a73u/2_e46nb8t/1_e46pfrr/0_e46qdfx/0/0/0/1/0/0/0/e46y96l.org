I am not a Draco apologist (I hate him) but even I will agree that his upbringing did not make it easy for him to walk the path of righteousness.

But the words of Dumbledore ring true, "It is our choice who define who we truly are.", and Draco's choices damn him. Regulus, Severus, and Sirius all had a hard path to walk and yet they in the end chose what is right. Draco never has that moment of redemption, where he willingly chooses good over evil.

At some point you must become accountable for your actions and I believe Draco was old enough to answer for what he has done.
