There are two possible explanations for that, though.

A. The remaining Death Eaters were actually exonerated for their crimes. Lucius was lying about it, but he successfully managed to claim that he was under the Imperius curse. This is a magical world in which mind control is possible and people don't have a way to defend against it, so it's not just Nuremberg "I was just following orders," it's people claiming that they literally didn't have a choice because of magic. You can't blame someone for something they did that was completely out of their control.

B. It again comes down to a matter of scale. The first war lasted throughout the 70s until 1981, with roots as far back as the 40s. That's a long war, affecting a small population, but still causing a great deal of fear and presumably a lot of damage. From Harry's perspective, we don't get the full story, but it's perfectly possible that the remaining families were fined and that the money allowed for the reconstruction of Magical Britain after the war.

On the topic of the DA, Cursed Child basically shows us Harry and Hermione in major positions of power in the aftermath of the second war. It's never explicitly stated, but is implied that they were able to seize power after the fact and essentially put Order members and DA members into key positions of influence in the aftermath.
