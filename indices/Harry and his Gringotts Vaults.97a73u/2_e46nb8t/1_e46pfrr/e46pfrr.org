This is dangerous, both France and England made unreasonable demands of Germany after WWI, forming the conditions for Hitler's rise to power and WWII. Criminal punishments vary differently in times of war; most (war) crimes are swept under the rug. No one had to answer for the 10+ million rapes in WWII, even though the victims were civilians.

As much as in a perfect world these sorts of things would happen, I would be very surprised for these things to occur. The system of Wizarding Government is shown to be corrupt and incapable of justice. I do not think (the ministry) is likely to do these sorts of things.
