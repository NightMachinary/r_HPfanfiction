  a) How much money is it reasonable to say Harry has in his trust vault?
#+end_quote

Someone did an 'analysis' of the scene in PS movie and came up with a number of 84000 Galleons.

  b) How much money is it reasonable to say is in the Potter family vault?
#+end_quote

There is NO canon confirmation of the Potter family vault. However, this is still a reasonable assumption IMO. If it were up to me, I would have make it ten times the size of Harry's trust vault.

  d) Is it reasonable to assume that the Potter family still owns property?
#+end_quote

Yes, but their buildings should be destroyed during the War. If Harry came out as the victor of the War, it would be reasonable to assume that he would make Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers to pay full compensation for his losses and punitive damages. Other families, who had suffered greatly through the War such as the Boneses, Longbottoms, and Weasleys, should ALL be entitled to similar claims. Death Eater children, who had willingly tortured fellow students at Hogwarts, had to pay BOTH monetary compensations to their victims and serve criminal punishments.

  e) How much money do you think Harry inherited from Sirius?
#+end_quote

You could assume that the Blacks had a lot more than the Potters. By my previous assumption of Potters having about 900k Galleons, giving the Blacks anywhere from 2M to 4M sounds fine to me.

On the other hand, the Blacks might have squandered their fortune and ended with up with only a few hundred Galleons in their vault, like in "A Black Comedy".

  h) How much would Hogwarts tuition be?

JKR already explained it was free.
