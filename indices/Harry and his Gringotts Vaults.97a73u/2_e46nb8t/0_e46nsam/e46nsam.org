  Someone did an 'analysis' of the scene in PS movie and came up with a number of 84000 Galleons.

That's... not really a lot, per the canon exchange rate. And I'm willing to admit info from the movies, very willing even, but on such stuff they didn't /plan it/ --- the writers didn't decide Harry had G84,000, it's the decoration department that built the Vault set a certain good-looking size, then said "fill this up with piles of as many fake gold coins as you need". So I'd say that while whoever did that analysis gets points for trying, it's kind of a fool's errand, and as we see comes down with silly numbers to prove it.
