People talk about how stupid the names were, but I thought they all made a lot of sense too...

Like, for god's sake, Draco named his son Scorpius, and his father's name was Lucius, we see a trail of very old sounding starry names.

Harry is not a very interesting name, and his parent's names Lily and James were also unremarkable. Ginerva, Molly and Arthur, only Ginerva is a bit remarkable in a way that it's older and less common. So his kids being named Albus, Lily, James ect. totally makes sense because those are all unremarkable names and fit with the theme of the character. I can't imagine Harry naming his kids "Aria," "Lissandra" or "Calchas" ect..

Obviously there are other complaints about the ending, but I'm always annoyed with people that are like HARRY WOULDNT NAME HIS KIDS THAT. He totally would. He's never shown any creativity in the books, and neither did his wife.
