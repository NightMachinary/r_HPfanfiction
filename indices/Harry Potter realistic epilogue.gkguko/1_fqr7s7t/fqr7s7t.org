I thought the Deathly Hallows epilogue was fine, though it seems unpopular with others. I thought the names made sense. Though we, the readers, recognize that Snape was not a good man and that his "love" for Lily was unhealthy and more of an obsession, Harry doesn't. To Harry, Snape was an unbelievably brave man (which he was!) who loved his mother, someone he idolizes because he never got to know her and because she sacrificed herself for him. When it comes to cursed child, something not written by JKR even if she insists she did, I don't like it much. Hermione could never have become minister, there's no way she has electability. Ron dropping out of the Auror force felt weird as well. I couldn't really see him leaving Harry.
