I wouldn't say it's a "wrong" version. Yes, there was a bit of confusion and /PoA/'s Conductor wasn't meant to be Flitwick; but as I recall, from the next movie onwards, it wasn't a "bureaucratic clusterfuck", it was just that the director decided they actually liked the Conductor's look better for Flitwick than the one they'd come up with for the first two films. It was a retcon, not a mistake. And at the end of the day it doesn't actually contradict the book --- indeed, Rowling said that she thought the first two movies' version of Flitwick looked too "supernatural" and, while too young, the Conductor is arguably closer to her original intent of what Flitwick should look like.
