Looking at the trailer, they've clearly just gamified the Movie universe. For instance, they use [[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/1/1c/Filius_Flitwick_battle.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/317?cb=20121103080247][wrong]] version of [[https://images.ctfassets.net/bxd3o8b291gf/ShsuS7mzmw62IskMKQE0k/ef3f471a769b18a19406ef4d5ebd5e4d/FiliusFlitwick_WB_F1_FlitwickStugglingToCarryBooks_Promo_080615_Port.jpg?w=455&h=455&fit=thumb&f=top&q=85][Professor Flitwick]].

For those who don't know, Flitwick didn't have a role in the 3rd film but they still offered Warwick Davis a cameo role as the conductor. Then because the films were a beurcractic cluterfuck, they simply used the Conductor make up for Phillius for the next film.

So no. I don't like the films and I don't think the people at Warner Bros. will treat the IP with any respect and I think even JK doesn't really about the Harry era of Hogwarts anymore if Cursed Child is anything to go by.
