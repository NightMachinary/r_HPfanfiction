You basically just described linkffn(Effloresco Secundus by romantiscue), though, to be fair, Hermione /does/ have to die to be reincarnated as Sakura.

Two authors I know of have written a badass!Hermione fic and a badass!Sakura fic:

- jacobk's linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) and linkffn(Trial by Ninja by jacobk) and sequel.
- Alrissa's linkffn(Kick in the arse of the Wizarding World by Alrissa) and linkffn(Deadly Decisions by Alrissa).
