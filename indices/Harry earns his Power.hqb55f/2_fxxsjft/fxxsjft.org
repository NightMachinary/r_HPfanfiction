Severus training Harry in the mind arts (legilimency/occlumency) and he eventually becomes on-par with Snape, Voldy, DD and uses this skill to defeat Voldy: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3389525/1/Stronger-Than-Hope]]

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/index.php?action=profile&id=1023][Harry Potter and the Enemy Within (and its sequel Chained Souls)]] is another mind arts Snape training Harry and it being pivotal in defeating LV.

/Problem of Potions/ is Harry earning his way to a Potions Mastery under Snape, but that story concludes before we ever see him gain his full mastery. But I have no doubt he does go on to do it in the future. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/chapters/23404335]] It also has fun sequels and side stories too.
