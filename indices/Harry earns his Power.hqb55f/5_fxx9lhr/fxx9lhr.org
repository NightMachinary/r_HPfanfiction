i think it can be easily done if you make voldemort attempt to steal the philosopher's stone around harry's 7th year, so by the time he is resurrected harry is 20 or so and has had more time to train/become powerful

of course to make this work you'd have to switch a lot of things up, but i can see it being done easily.

it feels more natural and proper for young adult harry to fight on somewhat even terms with voldemort than 15yr old harry.

sorry i got no recommendation for you, but i just wanted to give me pov.
