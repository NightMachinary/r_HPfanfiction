this is a fanfiction I've seen recommended a lot here.>! the trio work really really hard after Ginny dies in the chamber, using things like wit-sharpening potions, and they use a time-turner to get more study time in. !<also the names of the chapters are really cool too, unfortunately the author hasn't updated in a while.
