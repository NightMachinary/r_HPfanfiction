I'd see a three parts series.

1st part: Harry's days at Hogwarts (and maybe some pre Hogwarts stuff as well). Harry is very talented at magic, and develops a real passion for it. He starts to hone his skills.No Voldemort at this point. But Harry will have to face some of the dark lords old henchmen, like Lucius Malfoy (there are some nice things to do with Crabbe and Goyle Sr as a comic duo and Lucius as a mustache twirling villain) or Peter Pettygrew.This one could be a nice blend of comedy, mystery and adventure.

2nd part: Young adult Harry has to face some stronger Death Eaters who are thought to be in contact with Voldemort. The idea is to have Voldemort's figure looming in the background up to this point. Harry could probably face Rookwood/Bellatrix. Challenging opponents, for sure, but nowhere near Voldemort/Dumbledore.This part could become grittier.

3rd part: Later in life, the actual war against a resurrected Voldemort.

This way, the power curve would be a lot leaner while still ending with a good ass kicking for Voldemort.
