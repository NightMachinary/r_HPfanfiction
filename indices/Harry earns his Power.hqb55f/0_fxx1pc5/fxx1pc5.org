The problem is if you want that you need Harry to minimum be in his late twenties early thirties. Harry couldn't be on Voldemort or Dumbledore level sithout training and research magic for decades without him being overpowered

So you couldn't have Harry being in school as a student I would love to see a realistically powerful Harry

Edit: Sorry I thought this was a Prompt not a Request .I believe you could check Xerosis
