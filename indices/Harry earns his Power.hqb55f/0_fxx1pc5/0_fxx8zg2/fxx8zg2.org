The easiest way to circumvent this is making harry talented while he is a child.

Not even overpowered stuff, just making him live and breathe magic while growing up.

Instead of picking things up they come to his hand due to wandless magic,things like that. And when he comes to Hogwarts he doesn't need to be incredibly powerfull just a 'oh wow that is totally what I was doing all the time, wonder how to take it to the next level now?' By that point he would have had a decade of flexing his magic and intent. Even if he was weaker than Voldemort or Dumbledore on raw power and skill he could still rival them because he would understand magic on a deeper level or something of the sort.
