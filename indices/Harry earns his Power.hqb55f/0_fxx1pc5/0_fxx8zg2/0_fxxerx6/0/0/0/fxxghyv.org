I've seen a few.

The best way to approach this problem is to try and make your harry as powerfull as bellatrix or snape.

When he reaches this level, if harry is creative/smart enough he could kill Voldemort or Dumbledore if he made a plan or a good strategy.

The problem is that authors tend to make harry so strong that there is not really a point to the story since harry could just use a spell and end all human life or something in some fics.
