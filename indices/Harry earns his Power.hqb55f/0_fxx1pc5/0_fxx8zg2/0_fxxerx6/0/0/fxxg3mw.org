True

The problem with that is that some authors do put Harry against death eaters and aurors and Harry absolutely demolishes them with a single snap of his fingers :/ when Voldemort comes knocking he just dodges an avada and kills voldy with another snap of his fingers, it's ridiculous.

I agree, but the problem is that they almost always turn into power wank, and actually I don't think I've seen a fic where it /doesn't/ turn into power wank
