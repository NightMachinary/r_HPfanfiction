Of course, it's the easiest way to make sure harry is usefull when shit hits the fan.

If the author wants harry to fight Voldemort or Dumbledore then the only way for him to do it without dying instantly is having a level of power or skill superior than that of school children. The reason this leads to power wank is because these authors put these harry's in fights against their peers, rather than Aurors or skilled death eaters that would actually give them a challenge.

There is nothing wrong with the concept of magical child prodigy harry. It's just that there are bad stories based on it.
