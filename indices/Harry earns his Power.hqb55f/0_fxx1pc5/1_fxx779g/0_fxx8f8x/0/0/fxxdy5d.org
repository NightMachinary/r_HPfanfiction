I've written an essay on the subject and posted it here as to why it would be a bad story/impossible to write.

It basically boils down to:

1) Voldemort was as naturally talented as any Wizard ever as a child and Voldemort has learned for 60 years.

2) Volddmort must be respected to be a good villian - he isn't impressive if he does not live up to the expectation set up by 1).

3) Harry must therefore be more talented (mary sue/boring to read since he would have to have godlike power as a child) or have at least some long period to get more powerful (need time travel or post-hogwarts).

People dont want to read serious stories where Harry has godlike power because it removes many good storytellling tropes (overcoming barriers etc).
