I believe part of why Zephrok considers super!Harry fics to be 'bad' and 'impossible to write' is because it ignored the journey of how the MC became so powerful.

I enjoy a nice super!Harry fic as much as the next person but after having read so many they tend to get old. Many contain the same or similar tropes and cliches such as the goblins either adoring Harry simply because 'he is the first person in centuries to use manners to goblins' (despite the fact that wizarding bigotry would not include muggleborns or their families), the goblins giving him an inheritance test to 'prove he is who he says he is' resulting in him becoming the heir to the Potters, blacks, peverells, founders and occasionally some unknown Lordships, the goblins telling Harry that Dumbledore had been stealing his monetary assets to bribe the weasleys (etc). OR, the goblins try to cheat him at every turn and are simply grouchy bastards.

But I digress:

Harry generally gets special abilities, wandless magic, parsel magic, family magic, is a prodigy, etc etc.

This usually happens at the start of the story and takes away a large part of Harry's character building. He has little room for improvement and is never challenged by his opponents.

In fics where he is challenged by opponents, it's rather unrealistic because he has all that power, but he has no idea how to use it properly. It contradicts the whole super!Harry thing going on. It seems odd for the writer to give him so much power, with so many different uses, only for him to fail spectacularly.

Also, why give an eleven year old, the power to kill wizards 7 times his age with ease? And come out without any mental issues regarding killing a human being? Or for any issues to disappear within two chapters? And the horcrux hunts when he is still a child?

Next, we move on to the villain:

Like Zephrok (it was him, right?) mentioned, a villain had to be respected and feared. If not, it's not gonna be a very good story, is it?

It's long since been known, that Voldemort was a prodigious child, that he could use wandless magic before he came to Hogwarts, and he had no cares about injuring other children. In Hogwarts, he rose through the ranks of Slytherin, despite being a halfblood (though possibly thought to be a mudblood due to not knowing his parentage) and during his later years at Hogwarts (5th?) Kills Myrtle Warrens to create his first horcrux.

This alone shows he is an intelligent adversary, add on over half a century of practical magic studies and use, a few years in politics, and an army of death eaters, he is not someone to be messed with. During the first war, many of those willing to Satan's up to him were killed, and during the second their didn't seem to be many outside of Hogwarts, or the order of the Phoenix, both of which took a heavy blow with Dumbledore's death.

If Harry, at a young age, were to kill Voldemort, regardless of if he is yet to get another body, it makes all of Voldemorts accomplishments seem moot. After all, a child killed him, he couldn't have been THAT bad. It takes away the gear and the respect he has as a villain.

(I'm getting so distracted so I'll try to finish off soon, I've kinda forgotten what I had planned to write.)

We then have the struggle... What is there to struggle against when the MC just killed a MFing dark lord? Not getting homework in on time? End of year exams?

This also means the rest of Harry's Hogwarts years won't happen the same way.

HEAR THAT WRITERS?!?! IF YOU KILL VOLDEMORT BEFORE HARRY GOES TO HOGWARTS, NOTHING THAT HAPPENS THEIR CAN BE CANON!! (Sorry, it's a real peeve of mine).

(I've kinda forgot completely why I was writing this, but I don't want to delete it cause it might be relevant - I have no idea? - so I'm gonna post this anyway.)
