I look forward to your forthcoming essays regarding why the other topics I mentioned are impossible and no one should ever want to read them. I'm sure that, especially the trans!Harry/Draco, or the Snape/Voldemort child rape fandoms will /love/ to hear all about it.

And, frankly, you're just flat out wrong. You're replying to a comment from someone who wants to read a serious story where Harry beats Voldemort in magical combat, on a thread where a /different/ person also wants to read that. So some people obviously want to read it.

My story, where Harry is OP, has racked up a quarter million views and 1k follows since I started it in April. Granted, perhaps many of those viewers disliked this idea as you do - regardless, you are demonstrating my point that you're trying to police a topic in a /fanfiction/ community.

Do you think your essay, about why a fanfiction topic is "bad" and "impossible to write" will change minds? There are tons of articles about how The Bachelor is sexist, but it is still incredibly popular. Did it ever cross your mind that maybe people aren't interested in your opinion about their like/dislike regarding a /fictional story about wizards/?
