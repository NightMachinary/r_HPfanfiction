On a weekly basis, this sub has requests for fics where:

- Harry spreads his cheeks for his parents' murderer

- Harry gets fucked and/or impregnated (somehow) by his school teacher

- Harry falls in love with a wizard neo-nazi

- Hermione falls in love with actual nazis

- Harry or Draco switch sex and fall in love

But the minute someone requests a fic where the /hero/ of the story actually fights the f***ing villain, a whole crowd of knuckleheads comes charging out of the woodwork to scream about how "THAT COULD NEVER HAPPEN!!!!!"

I'm okay with writers wanting Harry to be preyed on by pedophile!Snape/Voldemort; it's not something I want to read, but to each their own. Let us have super!Harry. The world won't end, I promise.
