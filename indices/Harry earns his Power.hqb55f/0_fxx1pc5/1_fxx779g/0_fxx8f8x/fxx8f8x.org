Rly? Cause i am pretty sure you can find any HP fanfic one can think of on the net. I mean there is just so much of the stuff i am positive no one could go through it all in one lifetime. You could type type something random like harry is a dragon and there would propably be at least 13 fanfics available. I would counter that this is one of the more imaginative fanfic communities anywhere
