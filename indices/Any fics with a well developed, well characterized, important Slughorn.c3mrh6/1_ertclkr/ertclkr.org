  “Here comes the House That Ran,” muttered Lee Jordan darkly.

  “I beg your pardon, Mr. Jordan!” said Professor Slughorn, his cheeks coloring. Harry frowned at Lee. He knew that was what some of his peers called Slytherin House, but he wasn't happy about Lee saying it aloud, especially here. Were they doomed to rehash old grudges every year?

  Behind them, Hagrid rumbled, “S'true. No offense, Professor, I know you stayed to fight, but all the others---”

  “All the others /survived/,” said Slughorn, with ice in his tone, “I sent my students to the only place they would be safe if Hogwarts fell, while the other houses allowed children to fight. You may take pride in the number of Gryffindors whose names will be read today. I take pride in the number of Slytherins who are still alive.”
