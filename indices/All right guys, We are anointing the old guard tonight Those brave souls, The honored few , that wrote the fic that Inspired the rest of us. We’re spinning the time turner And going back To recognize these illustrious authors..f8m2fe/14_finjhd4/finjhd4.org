The Life and Times by Jewels5. Even though it probably will never be finished, it is still one of, if not the best Marauders-era Jily fics that I keep coming back to, and it leaves off at a point that doesn't feel so jarring. The writing style is beautiful and Jewels5 doesn't shy away from juggling a large cast of vibrantly complex characters who are trying to deal with their teenage drama while Voldemort rises in the background. It's an excellent depiction of the first war and the tensions that laid the foundation for Harry's generation, without falling into the same traps and tropes that so many other Marauders-era fics fall into.
