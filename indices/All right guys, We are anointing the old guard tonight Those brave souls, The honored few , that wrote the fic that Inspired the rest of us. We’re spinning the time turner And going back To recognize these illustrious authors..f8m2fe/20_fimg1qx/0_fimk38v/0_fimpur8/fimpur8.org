Personally, I don't get angry because it's shit, I get angry because it's recommended on every single fucking fic search thread. Like,

"looking for x", then some guy comes in "read HPMOR, its cool I guess" or "read HPMOR, this happens in chapter 65 for one paragraph and is then never mentioned again"

I hate the fic because of that, and because people hold it up as like this pillar of the community, when in actuality it's a pretty shit indy!harry fic with some extra arrogance and an author possessing of a titanic ego.
