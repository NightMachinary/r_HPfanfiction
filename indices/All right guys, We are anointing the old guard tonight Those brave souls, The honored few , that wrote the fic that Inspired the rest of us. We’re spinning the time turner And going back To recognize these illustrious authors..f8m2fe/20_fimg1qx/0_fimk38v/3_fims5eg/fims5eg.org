I feel much the same way. The condescension complaint in particular irks me. HPMOR has a plethora of serious problems (eg [[https://danluu.com/su3su2u1/hpmor/]] ), but Less Wrong actually does a pretty good job framing that condescension as a character flaw that Harry must overcome over the course of the story---Harry suffers setbacks due to dismissing and looking down on other people from the get-go, and each of those setbacks becomes a learning experience for him.
