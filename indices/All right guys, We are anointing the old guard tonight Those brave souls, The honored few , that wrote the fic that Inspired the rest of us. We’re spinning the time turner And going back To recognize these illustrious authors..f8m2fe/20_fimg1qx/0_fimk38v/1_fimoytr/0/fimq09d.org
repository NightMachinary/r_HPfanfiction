I think the worst part for me was how he kept trying to lecture people on magic.

Like, this lad has known about magic for two days, and he sees fit to mouth off about it to a man who has studied it for close to a hundred years? Get the fuck outta here. He doesn't even read his fucking textbooks.

What really broke me though was how much he hates magic and everything to do with it. His first reaction to anything cool isn't "wow, how does that work?", but "What the fuck, that's impossible, I hate it!", as seen when McGonnagal transforms into her cat form.
