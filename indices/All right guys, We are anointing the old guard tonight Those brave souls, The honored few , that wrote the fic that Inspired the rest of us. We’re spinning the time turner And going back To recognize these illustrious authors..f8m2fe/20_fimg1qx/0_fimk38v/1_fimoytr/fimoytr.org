To be fair it would be halved in length if you took out all of the condescension and preaching. There is actually an audiobook version. I freely admit I would have abandoned the fic if it wasn't for the audiobook.

Though I think the problem is people often fall in extremes like love/ hate. I read it and I liked some of the ideas, disliked others and was bored by yet others. I liked Hermione and Mcgonagall and the mock battles. I really, /really/ disliked Harry. This must be the most obnoxious version of him I've ever seen. So he's read a few science books and thinks that makes him wiser than adults with decades more experience than him. And anytime someone dares to disagree with him he throws a tantrum. Though I find it funny that normal home life and childhood produced a more whiny and irritating Harry than the abusive Dursleys.
