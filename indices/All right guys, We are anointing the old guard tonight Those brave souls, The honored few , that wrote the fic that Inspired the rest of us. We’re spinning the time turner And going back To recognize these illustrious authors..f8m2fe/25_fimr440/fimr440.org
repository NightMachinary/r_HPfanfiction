linkffn(The Lesser Sadness by Newcomb; The One He Feared by Taure; Wind Shear by Chilord)

Chapters 1 and 2 of 'The Lesser Sadness', Chapter 4 of 'The One He Feared' and Chapter 5 of 'Wind Shear'...best duelling scenes I've ever read.

Chapter 1 of TOHF also has an amazing backstory for the Dumbledore-Grindelwald fiasco, and Chapter 2 has the most creative curse-breaking scene.
