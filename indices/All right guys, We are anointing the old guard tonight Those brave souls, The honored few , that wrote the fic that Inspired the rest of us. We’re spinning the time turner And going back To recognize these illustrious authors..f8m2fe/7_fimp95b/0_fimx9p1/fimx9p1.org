Like- ever? I'm pretty sure it predates the internet. I think Star Trek had fanfiction as early as the '60s. Yep, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_fiction#Star_Trek_fandom][Wikipedia]] confirms that:

#+begin_quote
  The modern phenomenon of fan fiction as an expression of fandom and fan interaction was popularized and defined via /Star Trek/ fandom and their fanzines published in the 1960s. The first /Star Trek/ fanzine, /Spockanalia/ (1967), contained some fan fiction; many others followed its example.

Otherwise, the oldest HP fanfic on fanfiction.net is from September of '99. That's before Goblet of Fire was even released. Though I don't know if there are other sites with fics older than that.
