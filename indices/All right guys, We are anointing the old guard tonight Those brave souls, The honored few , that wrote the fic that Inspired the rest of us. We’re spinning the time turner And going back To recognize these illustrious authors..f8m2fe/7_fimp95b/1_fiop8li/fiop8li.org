Technically a lot of literature can be classified as fan fiction, because the concept of copyright is relatively new.

here's something I found on [[https://tjmystic.tumblr.com/post/141003600885/so-when-i-was-doing-my-thesis-on-whether-or-not][tumblr]]:

  So, when I was doing my thesis on whether or not fanfiction should be considered a legitimate genre of literature, my advising professor asked me for examples. I gave him the generic ones, of course - “Pride & Prejudice and Zombies” is a horror fanfic of “Pride & Prejudice”, “50 Shades of Grey” is an erotica fic of “Twilight" - and that seemed to make him understand what fanfiction is, but not how it's useful. So I thought about it, and, after about a minute, I said, “Paradise Lost is basically a fanfiction of the Book of Genesis. And The Divine Comedy is an epic self-insertion fic for Catholic doctrine. So, basically, you were teaching us fanfiction last semester.” I had never before seen a grown man's eyes widen with such fear, incomprehension, disgust, awe, and understanding.

I'd argue "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead" is fan fiction of Hamlet.
