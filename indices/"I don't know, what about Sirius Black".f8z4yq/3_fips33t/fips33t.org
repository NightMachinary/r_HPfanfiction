There is a pretty effective rhetorical strategy where you adopt the opponent's assumptions and attempt to prove them wrong within their own paradigm.

For example, instead of insisting that Voldemort has returned and that's why they need to learn to defend themselves, Harry could have avoided mentioning Voldemort completely and just asked Umbridge why the Ministry has Aurors if there aren't any dark wizards out there.

But Harry isn't the best at arguing. He's too principled to be able to see things from anyone's point of view but his own. That means he would never use the above strategy - it's not in his nature to be able to step outside of his own assumptions/values. If he was capable of that kind of "decoupling", he would have been better at occlumency.
