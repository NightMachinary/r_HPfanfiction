Heh. Touche. :)

Do we know how that training actually works? Like, are they paired with senior aurors and trained like Doctors? One senior auror wandering around with a little flock of apprentices trailing behind and learning from them specifically? Or is it a smaller school like Hogwarts? I don't remember anything myself.
