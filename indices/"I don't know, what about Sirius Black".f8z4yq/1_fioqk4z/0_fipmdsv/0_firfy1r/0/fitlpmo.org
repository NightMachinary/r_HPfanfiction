That'd be interesting. A rephrased prophecy where it's all just "Born as the seventh month dies, the Chosen one will just fuck shit up." type sentiments the whole way through. :D

The only reason Dumbledore never told any of the teachers about this prophecy would be Minerva's inevitable breakdown at the thought of a prophesied child who was even more bother than James, Sirius, Peter, and Remus were. :D

"He will be chaotic, and the Tabby will drink of the Glen of Morangie." :D
