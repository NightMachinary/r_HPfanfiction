"Harry, it's your destiny." Dumbledore's usually cheerful bearing was nowhere to be seen, replaced instead by a grave demeanor.

"What do mean, Professor? What destiny?" Harry did his best to not allow his confusion to turn to fear - the last time Dumbledore used that voice had been in second year while dealing with the basilisk disaster.

"A prophecy was made by Sybil Trelawney a few months before your birth. /The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord of Chaotic Evil approaches... Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not...the unpredictability of the complete absence of common sense... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... The Hero of Chaotic Idiocy will be born as the seventh month dies, and he will be legendary for his Super Chaotic Stupid .../ Harry, I'm afraid your bad OWL results were predicted more than a decade ago."
