I think she was death eater sympathizer and knew exactly what was going on. I do not think she was innocent or misled at all. Her actions after Voldemort took over were pretty sadistic. The only reason I think she wasn't a full blown death eater is due to the horcrux. She wore it openly, proudly proclaiming it to be a family heirloom. Had she been in Voldemort's presence - he would have recognized it instantly.
