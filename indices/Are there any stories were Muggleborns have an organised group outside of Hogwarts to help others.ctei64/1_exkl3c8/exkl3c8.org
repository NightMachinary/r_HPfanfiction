I think Wish Carefully by Ten Toes has a bit (But only a bit) of that. It is a oneshot in which harry makes a contract voldemort and the death eaters into letting all the light supporters and muggleborns to leave britain and go to other countries if he lets all the dark supporters have magical england if they leave the muggles alone on penalty of losing magic. It is quite amusing to see just HOW devastating the effects were.

Also, it is not one of those stories that say death eaters are misunderstood. In this story, you are meant to feel happy that this is the death eaters fate.

Anyways, i think the idea of an underground muggleborn railroad sounds interesting.
