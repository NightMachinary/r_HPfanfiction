Hm, when I had a Kindle, I used to download the fics in MOBI format on a computer, send it to myself, and download it on my Kindle. Now that I think about it that sounds a little tedious, especially with the number of fics I read, but I guess at the time it seemed fine as long as I got my fix of fic.

Sadly my precious Kindle disappeared, and now I read on the laptop... which is extremely inconvenient since it's not even /my/ laptop and it hurts my eyes. Planning to go back to what I did with the Kindle when I can buy one in the future. Though I do want to know a more convenient way of doing it.
