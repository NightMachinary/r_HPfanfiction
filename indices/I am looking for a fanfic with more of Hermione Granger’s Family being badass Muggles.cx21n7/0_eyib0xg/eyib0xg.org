Hermione's parents are pretty badass in Escape. She has kept them abreast of all the happenings in the wizarding world, and she has shared as much of the world (magic, history, potions, etc) with that as she can. Her mum also doesn't take shit from anyone. I really enjoyed their relationship. Full disclosure Escape is an anti-marriage law fic with Harry/Hermione. It also features a great friendship between Snape and McGonagall. Linkffn(11916243).
