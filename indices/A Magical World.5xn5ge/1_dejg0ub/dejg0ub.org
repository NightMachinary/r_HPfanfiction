Someone recently mentioned the brit dominated world in my story. They had a fair point and i planned to write a chapter about the twins going on a world tour to see what the other cultures are like. My gran passed so my story is on hiatus but soon there'll be a chapter about t'ryl traveling Ignotus to see the cultures then a few years alter taking her and Harry's twins to see the world. Harry/oc/star trek character or potential oc, hermione is dead but her painting is an advisor, formerly harry/hermione/fleur
