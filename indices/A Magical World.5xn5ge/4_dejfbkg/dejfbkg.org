In my story "Patron", the characters spend time in France, Bulgaria, the Balkans, the Magical Ottoman Empire, Jamaica and Scandinavia. I tried to make every culture different as well. For example, werewolves are valued very highly in Magical Scandinavia, but treated as dark creatures everywhere else in Magical Europe.
