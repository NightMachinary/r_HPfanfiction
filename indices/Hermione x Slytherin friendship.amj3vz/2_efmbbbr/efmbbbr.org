Linkffn(12526865) is a retelling from HBP on from Hermione's POV with a couple of non-canon twists that features a WONDERFUL Hermione/Theo friendship. The endgame will be Dramione, but we're 56 chapters in and it's still not the focus of the story. I highly recommend it; the writing is very good and super witty.
