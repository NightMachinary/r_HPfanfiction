linkffn(Nihil est ab omni parte beatum) is an excellent Hermione/Theo, back in time fic with an interesting plot and some unusual aspects. The friendships are definitely portrayed interestingly, but it's more about the couple having a slow build and then growing to accept each other's friends. The author is fantastic and has written some great stuff.
