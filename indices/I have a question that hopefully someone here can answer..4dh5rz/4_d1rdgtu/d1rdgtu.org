My understanding is that it isn't the venom itself that would give Harry the ability to destroy horcruxes. The reason that worked was because the sword of Griffindor was goblin made and therefore took in what made it stronger. It's the object absorbing the venom and not a characteristic of the venom itself. Ergo it was the sword taking in the venom that gave it the ability and not the venom entering the object, if that makes sense.
