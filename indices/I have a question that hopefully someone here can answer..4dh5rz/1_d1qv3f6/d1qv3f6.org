The Horcrux resided in or near the curse scar on his forehead. The venom likely did not have a chance to reach that area before it was neutralized. I can't say I know anything about antivenom, but I'm assuming it neutralizes the venom's harmful effects, even if it doesn't remove the venom itself. Removing the venom's harmful effects would likely mean that it lost its magic-destroying properties by the time the venom reached the scar area.
