First off, because it bugs the hell out of me: canon, not cannon. The one is a synonym for "official" most often used in fanfiction and fandoms to describe the original authors work , the other is a tool of war, used to shoot projectiles at high velocity.

And I personally always assume that Harry is somewhat friendly with most people in Gryffindor, on mostly neutral ground with Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw and in a general state of distrust and animosity with Slytherin. I'd say he's friendly with his dormmates, friends with the Quidditch team and maybe friends, or at least well-acquainted with the DA members. I also assume that he knows at least the names of all of his year-mates and of most, if not all, of Gryffindor.
