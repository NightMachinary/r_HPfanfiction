Indeed it is impossible to say. I just find it interesting how we have far more fics where Harry goes edgy and alone to Harry moves to spend time with his other friends which surely he must have even if they are not as close. When Ron joins up with Dean and Seamus in GoF neither Dean nor Seamus are show saying anything about this which suggests he often spends time with them so I can only assume Harry sometimes chats to others too.
