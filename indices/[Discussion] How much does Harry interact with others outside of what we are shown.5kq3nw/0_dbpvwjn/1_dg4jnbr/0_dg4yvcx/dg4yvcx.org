The part where he got his grades in HBP for his OWL exams? In all the important subjects he has an E or an O i.e. the equivalent of a B or A in Muggle exams. If wizarding grade spread is anything like the Muggle world, that easily puts him in the top 5%. It's certainly enough to justify the proposition that he has a decent general idea about the content of the subjects he is studying.
