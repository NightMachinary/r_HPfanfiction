Pretty good grades? - CITATION NEEDED! (I'd like to know how you got that idea!)

As far as I remember Harry excelled at one subject and one subject only: Defense against the Dark Arts - in all others he was kind of mediocre (not good, but not worthless either! Still, nothing to be really proud of!) and he was kind of lazy (if Hermione didn't prod him he'd probably be even worse!) - a slacker if you wish, more interested in quidditch and chess (kind of a jock - someone getting by in school because of being a damned prodigy at sports! In RL you have people who get into fucking college/university (even Ivy-Fucking-League!) because they are good at fucking football or basketball etc...IMHO this is so wrong and needs to stop...think about all those nerds those kind of guys use to do their homework/write their papers etc.!)) and generally being a lazy bum with Ron (look at his electives! He chose the easiest ones available (ok, not fully, he could have probably aced muggle-studies...but I don't think CoMC is super difficult and neither is "how to deceive a fraud with crazy made up homework" (otherwise known as Divination!) which he and Ron took for "an easy OWL"!)

ps: I don't think Harry is the most sociable guy - sure he knows the names of his classmates and a few things about them (especially the guys he shares a dorm with and the members of his quidditch-team), but that's what happens if you go to school with people for 6 years...I know stuff about my former classmates, too and I was very withdrawn etc. (and bullied because of it))
