Impossible to answer precisely because it isn't shown lol.

However, it's worth considering just how little we see of Harry's life. This is the origin of the popular idea that Harry doesn't really understand much about magic - Harry is our PoV, and we the reader don't really know much about magic, so we assume the same is true for Harry. But of course Harry has been spending years at a school of magic, attending classes, doing homework, and getting generally pretty good grades. He knows far more about magic than we do - as seen by the way he pulls spells out of nowhere that we never saw him learn.

I'm convinced that a lot of the reason why people think Harry is an average or above-average wizard is that we don't see him learning magic. But everyone else treats him like he's a very good wizard, which is I think telling.

If this is true of Harry's magical ability, it may also be true of his social circle. Just as he pulls new spells out of nowhere, he also seems to be familiar with a large number of people with whom we never saw him previously interact (like McLaggen in HBP).
