He's not really as isolated as you'd think, but he isn't the star of the party either.

He interacts with other people to what I presume to be a fairly reasonable degree, as he knows many of the people, but whereas Ron and Hermione (and a few others in later years) are “friends”, people with whom he spends time just because he can, the others are all “acquaintances”, people he simply knows and occasionally talks with but doesn't get particularly close to.

This is precisely why he became so frustrated and aggressive in fifth year: when the public perception of him (again) became so negative, all the “acquaintances” became shunning him and because they weren't complete strangers it hit him quite hard in addition to the other stuff already happening.
