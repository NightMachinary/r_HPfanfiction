There is the dogfather by hollimichele linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487]]). Instead of taking him in they call the police, rip his name out of the letter and hide the name in the blanket, then tell the police they found this baby on their doorstep, they've never seen or heard of him before. He's quickly adopted by an older muggle couple who've been wanting a child for years.

This leaves both Harry and them without the blood protection, and it's strongly hinted that they are killed by Death Eaters looking for Harry. There is no bashing of anybody as far as I can see, the story treats many characters quite kindly, even the Dursleys. Except for voldemort of course. Fuck him though.
