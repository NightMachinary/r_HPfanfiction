It's not exactly what you asked for, but Linkffn(Replay) has the blood wards failing when Harry says that Privet Drive isn't his home to some dudebros in a pub. Fair warning, though, it also has him in a romantic and very nearly sexual relationship with a woman in her thirties. To their credit, the author /does/ realise how creepy this is, but it was enough for me to drop the fic.
