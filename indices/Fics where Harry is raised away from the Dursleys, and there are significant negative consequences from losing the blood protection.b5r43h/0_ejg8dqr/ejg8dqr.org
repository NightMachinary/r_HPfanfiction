There is a story where when Weasley boys pick Harry from the Privet Drive, they are discovered and kicked out by the uncle Vernon (“And never return back!”). The blood wards fall and the next morning Harry's breakfast at Weasleys is interrupted by professor Dumbledore, white as a wall, announcing to Harry that all Dursleys were killed by Death Eaters. I think the story was unfinished and stopped not long after this.

This is also mentioned in linkffn(5435295), which is just a bit random soul binding story. Because soul bound is from the magical point of view equivalent of the marriage, Harry is from the magical point view emancipated and thus the blood wards fall down. They are attacked by two werevolves, and ... NO SPOILERS!

Which leads to another question: are there any stories, where the wards are actually tested? In the cannon there is no attack on Privet Drive (except for dementors but that's outside of the bounds of 4 Privet Drive) and we don't even know what would happen if somebody tried.
