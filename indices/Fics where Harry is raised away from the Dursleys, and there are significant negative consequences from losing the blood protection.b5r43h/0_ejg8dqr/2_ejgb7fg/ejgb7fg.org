I thought Dumbledore admitted in HBP or maaaaybe OotP that there were a bunch of attacks on Number 4, but Harry didn't notice because the blood wards were so effective and there was an unspoken assumption that the bad guys didn't want to mount an open assault.

Harry could probably have been grabbed off that playground he sometimes hid at if the wards were narrow enough to let a dementor attack him right in his neighbourhood.
