Yes, I would.

And maybe I would consider giving some older and trustworthy students the power to oversee and punish them when no teacher is around.

Additionally, you could create different teams, and punish the whole team if a student misbehaves, and thus create some social pressure to behave. This might be implemented by a points system or something similar.

Additionally, you can be mindful of what spells you teach in what order, for example teach mostly temporary spells in the beginning, and if something happens, let the students learn to deal with it.

The problem is that in the end, they will all be grown up, and wield their wand daily. Teaching some form of responsibility early helps.

And if there is one thing much worse than a mindless teenager that hurts someone stupidly, it is a mindful adult that hurts someone deliberately. In the wizarding world that seems to be a distinct possibility, so they ought to have some mindfulness about the existence of dicks with wands.
