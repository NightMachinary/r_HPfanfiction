Linkffn(The Merging) is an interesting case: it features Harry/Tonks (in a way that I personally found pretty squicky- the fic indirectly states that they're second cousins*) while Tracey has a massive crush on Harry that's mostly unrequited, but also might not be and it's kinda vague about it. As a warning, though, it's one chapter (plus two epilogues) away from completion, currently ends on a cliffhanger, and hasn't updated in a little over a year.

Also, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chance Encounter) is an OT3 fic, but the first chapter is strictly Harry/Tracey, so you can read it as a one shot.

* Second cousins once removed, to be precise, which means that one of Harry's great-grandparents is one of Tonks' great, great-grandparents. While that isn't /super/ related, it's more related than I'd personally want a romantic and/or sexual partner to be.
