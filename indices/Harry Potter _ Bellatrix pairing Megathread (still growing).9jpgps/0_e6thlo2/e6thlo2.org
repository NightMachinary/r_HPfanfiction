If you don't mind abandoned stories then:

/Only Enemies/ has Harry and Bellatrix stuck in the past/AU hating each other. I remember it being readable, but not really that good. 5.5/10 linkffn(2896398)

/Ouroboros/ never really gets to the actual pairing so to speak, but there is plenty of interaction between the two. This story could have been great if it wasn't abandoned so prematurely. 7.5/10 because it is really well written but is essentially smut at this point. linkffn(6927447)
