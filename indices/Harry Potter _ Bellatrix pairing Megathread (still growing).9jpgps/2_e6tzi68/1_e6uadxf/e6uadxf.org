Yeah, Delenda est had so much potential then the whole skip forward in time thing was just bad.

I didn't think Stepping Back was that bad but the last update was fucking terrible the author “killed” harry but he didn't die cuz of some bullshit and then Bellatrix goes insane and starts murdering children of death eaters. I can't see myself going back to the story.
