Man, this pairing is in bad shape if this is seriously the best there is.

Delenda est has 20 good chapters and 20 bad chapters, ultimately averaging out to a mediocre-to-average fic, one that has a horrendous sequel.

Wind Sheer is atrocious. Let's not beat around the bush just because the author died recently. There story had some potential, but it was pretty much squandered before the first chapter was even over. The only thing the story has going for it that it is complete, and it is Harry/Bellatrix. If all you care about is jamming words into your eyes regardless of content, it works.

Earl of the North is the testbed for Delende Est. When it came out, there was very little else with the pairing. But, let's not try and convince ourselves that it was even good back then.

Steeping Back is just mind-nubingly tedious.

Passageways is terrible, and I don't know how anyone can make it past the first chapter. The list of cliches is quite impressive.

Other than those I can think of Only Enemies which is pretty good, but abandoned, and largely unedited, which affects its readability. Turning of the Sun is interesting, but boring, and the author gets sidetracked with too much random shit.
