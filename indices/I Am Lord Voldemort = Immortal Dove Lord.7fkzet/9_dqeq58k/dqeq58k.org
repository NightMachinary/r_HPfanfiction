Years ago, I made a wizard rock/electronic band from the perspective of Ron in fourth year, when he is jealous of Harry for entering the Triwizard Tournament but before the dragon task. Ron, in a fit of jealousy, decides he hates Harry and will become his own dark lord. Ronald Bilius Weasley anagrams to I Was Lord Elbin Ausley. I played one show even.
