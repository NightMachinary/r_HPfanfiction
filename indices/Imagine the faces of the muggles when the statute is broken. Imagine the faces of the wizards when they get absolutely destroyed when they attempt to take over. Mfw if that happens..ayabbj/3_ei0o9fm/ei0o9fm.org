The problem with that whole scenario is that you have two dark lords, over half a century, planning to enslave, kill or at least segregate and discriminate against the muggle born and then take over the World. By the time of the Boy Who Lived events, they would have run to their muggle government for protection, in exchange for intel, wards, counter measures and not a few highly trained MI5/MI6 agents.

When I read about the PM knowing about the Minister of Magic and hence magic itself (a surprise as I had only watched the movies) I though it was all beyond implausible. No different than the governments in the X-Men universe hunting down mutants "on principle", as if governments had any, instead of weaponizing them.
