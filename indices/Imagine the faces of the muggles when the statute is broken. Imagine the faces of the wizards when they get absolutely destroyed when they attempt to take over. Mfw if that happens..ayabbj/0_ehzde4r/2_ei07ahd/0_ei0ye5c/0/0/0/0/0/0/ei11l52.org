If two of the most powerful dark wizards in history are confident that they could rule muggles, maybe that means /they could./ They both lived during WW2, they certainly knew what kind of weapons muggles possessed, and yet they still seem utterly unafraid of muggles.

This, with the fact that the magical Ministry already does whatever it wants with muggles, tells us that wizards are indeed superior, that magic is might, and that muggles wouldn't stand much of a chance.
