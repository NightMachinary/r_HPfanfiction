Seriously.

You have a group of people who can control minds and actions, become invisible, unleash fire that would put the California wildfires to shame, and can appear and disappear in an instant.

Look how effective terrorism is right now in America and Europe. A few bombings in the right places, a plane into a building, and you have massive panic and society changes. Wars started, discrimination on color/religion and horrible fears that an attack could happen again.

Now think of this about a million times worse. That is what wizards could be. Muggles would be shaking in their boots, as they wouldn't know who is compromised, where Wizards would appear next and what else they could do. Honestly, wizards would be almost unbeatable.
