So... You gonna bomb London?

Most wizards live in secret communities within major muggle cities. Nuclear bombs become a weakness not a strength. A single wizard could apparate and launch nukes if they wanted... Or imperius those who have the ability to launch.

BTW, all those 'strengths' can be countered by magic. Shields block physical objects (bullets), tanks are big bulky and can be easily taken down by a wizard popping in. We have no idea if going invisible also hides every trace of someone including heat signatures.

I don't know how snipers would be useful if they don't know where wizards are.

Long story short, We have all this tools today and still can't stop terrorism... And these people don't even have magic. All it takes is a single wizard casting fire onto London and millions would die. A single wand is a powerful as a nuclear bomb.

What's more unbelievable is the fact muggles aren't already subservient to wizards. It's disbelievable that no one has not tried to take over the world using magical means or revealed them. One wizard could ruin everything.
