Waffle. The wizards will have no idea where the commander/generals will stay during the war. And I know for a fact that geaurilla warfare won't work as well with wizards then the Vietnamese. The Vietnamese used insanely complex tunnels and the jungle to attack and disappear. Wizards haven't made complex tunnels nor do they know the forests enough to gain am advantage. Plus the Vietnamese used boobie traps to do the maximum amount of damage possible as well as modern weaponry (they used explosives like grenades, mines and artillery shells among ak47s ar' s and sks carbine/semi automatic rifle as well as other modern weapons) what do wizards have? A bloody stick that shoots random shit that what lol
