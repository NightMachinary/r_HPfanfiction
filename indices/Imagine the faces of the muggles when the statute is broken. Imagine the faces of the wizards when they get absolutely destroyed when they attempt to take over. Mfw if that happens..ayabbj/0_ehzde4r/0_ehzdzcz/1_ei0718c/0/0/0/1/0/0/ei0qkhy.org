They actually have to think of a spell, wich will be fast (I'm not gonna lie) if there experienced. It will almost be like a mma fighter choosing what strike to throw. But they need to raise the wand the choose a spell then cast it. I personally think a trained soilder that is ready to shoot will beat a wizard in speed 9 times out of 10 because all the need to do is aim and pull the trigger.
