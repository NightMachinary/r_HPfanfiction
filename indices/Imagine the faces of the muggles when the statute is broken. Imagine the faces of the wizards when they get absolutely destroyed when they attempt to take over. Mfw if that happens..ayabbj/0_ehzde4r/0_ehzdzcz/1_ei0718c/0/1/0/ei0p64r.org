Wizards can blow up tanks. They don't need to get inside of it. Same with any armored vehicle. They wouldn't even have to be near the tank.

Plus, they don't need to target the miltary. If wizards burnt down the cities, or killed millions of everyday people... Or poisoned food and water supplies...

Again you keep talking as if it would be two armies facing off. That's not even a thing nowadays. Almost all warfare is guerrilla based and we know wizards can do this due to the death eaters.

One wizard can cause far more damage to the public than any one muggle to a Wizarding community...and everyone in the Wizarding community is armed unlike the vast majority of muggles.

They could completely dodge the army and go for the salting of the earth method.
