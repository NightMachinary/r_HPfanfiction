I never mentioned it as 2 armies facing of. And about guerrilla warfare look at the second wizarding war. There was no guerrilla type tactics. And it looked like 2 armies facing of in the movies...... I guarantee that they will find it insanely difficult to blow tanks and armoured vehicles up (maybe except an insanely powerful like Dumbledore, grindelwald, Merlin etc) spells like bombardo maximo blows walls and shit up. We never seen them blow anything armoured up. The only time I saw it being used it blowing a wall of an old as castle up. Give evidence that magic can "blow up" muggle tech that is designed to with stand explosions and bullets?
