  What the he'll are portkey bombs?
#+end_quote

A Portkey is an object from the Harry Potter stories, enchanted to instantly transport anyone touching it to a specific location.

Now make a bomb or an explosive potion a portkey, throw a bug at it, and boom, teleporting bombs. How will your precious muggles counter that?

  Wizards can't send nukes.
#+end_quote

Of course they can. Muggles can, so can wizards. Wizards can do everything Muggled can and they have a magic as a plus. They only need launch codes. If only there was magic to find that...oh wait. Confundus, Imperio, Legilimency, truth potions, love potions. They can easily use Muggle nukes against Muggles.

  Not everyone cast a fiendfyre, its extremely dificult to master and can be fatal to the witch/wizard that casted it
#+end_quote

You are barely correct. Barely. Yes, it is very difficult to control/master, but you don't have to. Fiendfire and apparate out. Or Fiendfire from your brooms while you are invisible. About the casting part, Crabbe easily casted it. And he is an inbred, stupid, incompatant moron. He learned to cast it within a year of Dark Magic being taught at Hogwarts. He couldn't master it, but if he fought a huge muggle army he wouldn't have to. Fiendfire, apparate. How will the muggles counter that?

  Liquid luck can't and was never produced in mass so that's not an advantag
#+end_quote

It is difficult to brew, I'll give you that. It wasn't mass used in Wizarding Wars because if one side used it, both would. So you achieved nothing except having to constantly have your potions masters keep making them to make sure the other side doesn't have an advantage. It would devolve into a cold war. And your logic is strange. Why would it not be an advantage? Say you have 5 average wizards all drink it. 5 wizards that are now nigh-inhitable and can cast magic far better than ever before. Harry using the potion was able to silently conjure a glassfull of wine, something he couldn't normally do.

  And wizards aren't as versed in war and combat as trained soilder are.
#+end_quote

Most soldiers aren't either. Bossman tells me the plan, I follow. The same applies to Wizards. And again, they outclass Muggles in every way. It's like asking who would win in a battle between a bug and a god. God, obviously.
