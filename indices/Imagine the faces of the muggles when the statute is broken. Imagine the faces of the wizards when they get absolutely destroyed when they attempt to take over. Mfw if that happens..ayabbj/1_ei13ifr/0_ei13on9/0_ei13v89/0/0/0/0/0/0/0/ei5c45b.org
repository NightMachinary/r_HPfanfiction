I'll let you deal with this. These are comments of logical people

"As the battle prolongs, the wizards lose their advantage of having superior knowledge. Many of the commenters here seem to have no idea how the military works. I'm currently serving and have seen first hand how scary an organised military can be. Attack Gringotts and Wizarding Britain falls. Goblin guards? Send an infantry battalion. Dragon? Send an armour battalion. Protective charms and wards? Send an artillery battalion. Boom. Gringotts is gone.

Wizards might use memory charms etc to manipulate the leaders of the muggle world? Well, once the war begins, muggle leaders are going to be hiding in fortified bunkers with dozens of guards.

It would be a draw. In the initial stages, the wizards have the advantage since muggleborns know about muggles while muggles know nothin'. However, sooner or later, the muggles will get their hands on at least a few wizards. And we know, how efficient the CIA's torture methods are.

However, if the wizards change to guerilla tactics, it would be nearly impossible to eradicate them. Invisibility cloaks, disillusion, muggle-repelling wards etc would make the survivors extremely hard to find. Hence, a draw seems most likely. As for a one-to-one fight between a wizard and a muggle? A wizard would win. However, a muggle soldier vs an Auror? Aurors and Wizards are not trained to kill. Muggle soldiers are. And muggle military personnel alone are probably superior in numbers compared to the entire wizarding world. However, if the wizards change to guerilla tactics, it would be nearly impossible to eradicate them. Invisibility cloaks, disillusion, muggle-repelling wards etc would make the survivors extremely hard to find. Hence, a draw seems most likely. And I almost forgot another key factor - speed. Let's say Wizarding Britain and Wizarding Bulgaria decide to attack muggle France. Fudge sends a message by owl. The owl would take several days to travel to Bulgaria.

In comparison, Theresa May gives Putin a call. “Let's attack Wizarding France.” “Sure. “ Within 15 minutes, both sides would have already scrambled a squadron of fighter jets each. Within 4 hours, both countries would have a battalion-sized force ready.

Edit: Also, you don't need to see something to hit it. You can fire artillery by aiming at a "hole" in the map. And again, good luck hitting tactical nuclear warheads as they come at you at supersonic speeds. An ICBM warhead has a terminal velocity of several thousand meters per second. Good luck hitting that with a spell, nevermind multiple warheads carried by one missile. Also, you'd need to track down all missile submarines before they can launch, and again, good luck with that.

That's why it's completely stupid and total wizard wank if someone thinks they could be intercepted by some spells in the flight. The obvious counter to that are SSBNs. Good luck finding every single missile submarine with standing orders to launch should their country fall. Each is capable of turning earth into a nuclear wasteland. Especially the Russian Typhoons, which have the same displacement as a treaty battleship.

It's nearly impossible for the navies which do that for a living, nevermind wizards whose experts are too stupid to consider buying a book to answer the question "what are rubber ducks for".
