  It would be a draw. In the initial stages, the wizards have the advantage since muggleborns know about muggles while muggles know nothin'.

If only there was a department that constantly deals with Muggles...if only...Oh wait. There is. The Obliviators. They known about Muggles and they work fast. A couple of their feats:

Teams of Obliviators were involved in modifying the memories of Muggles who had seen giants uprooting trees in the West Country. Upon finding and modifying all of their memories, they thought it was a huge hurricane. Obliviators regularly have to perform Memory Charms on Muggles who have see the Loch Ness Monster. That means they have a way to quickly find any muggle who has seen said monster. A rogue Welsh Green dragon descended on a beach full of Muggle holidaymakers. Tilly Toke and her family happen to be there, and her family casts the largest Mass Memory Charm of this century on all the Muggles of Ilfracombe. The Muggles later remember nothing of the incident, with the exception of an old fellow known as Dodgy Dirk, who still claims that a “dirty great flying lizard” attacked him on the beach. People think he's crazy, of course. One family was good enough to wipe out the memory of *All* of Ilfracombe except one person. That's 11,183 Muggles, modified before the news of the Dragon could spread. 11 thousand. Obliviators are no joke. But, if only there was another department heavily involved in Muggles...Oh, wait. There is. Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Department. The Department that went into the Muggle World and made sure all of their objects were Magic-free. If only there was someone else who would know about muggles...Oh, wait. There is. Minister of Magic controls the Muggle Prime minister and hS wizards infiltrated within Muggle Government ranks. Nobody ever noticed anything wrong with them. Do I really need to go on?

  However, sooner or later, the muggles will get their hands on at least a few wizards.

Please, do go on and tell me how.

Mind you, you are heavily overestimating Muggles and their efficiancy. Isis(an terrorist organisation originally created by the USA) was fighting with USA since 1999 until 2017. 18 years that the might of USA took to defeat a terrorist organisation, leagues weaker than USA. But sure they could totally defeat a community of people who can bend reality to their will(*SARCASM*)

  And we know, how efficient the CIA's torture methods are.
#+end_quote

Even if they did catch a couple of Wizards, other Wizards could very easily rescue them. Oh, btw, you know what would happen if Muggles tortured Wizards? An Obscurial. Couple of quotes about them.

#+begin_quote
  It's an unstable, uncontrollable dark force that busts out and attacks, and then vanishes An Obscurial may lose control when they reach their emotional and mental breaking point, releasing their Obscurus as an invisible (or nearly invisible) destructive wind. In extreme cases, they may physically transform into an Obscurus. When an Obscurial releases the Obscurus within, their eyes become pure white and their physical form vibrates and becomes distorted. While the Obscurus is invisible, the Obscurial can physically interact with the world without making physical contact, though the ability is uncontrolled and triggered by the host's distress, anger, or other intense emotions. This notably damages structures and objects near the host.

It seems to me that capturing Wizards would do the CIA more bad than good.

#+begin_quote
  As the battle prolongs, the wizards lose their advantage of having superior knowledge. Many of the commenters here seem to have no idea how the military works. I'm currently serving and have seen first hand how scary an organised military can be. Attack Gringotts and Wizarding Britain falls. Goblin guards? Send an infantry battalion. Dragon? Send an armour battalion. Protective charms and wards? Send an artillery battalion. Boom. Gringotts is gone.

Not sure why you felt the need to steal that comment twice, but I already answered this part.
