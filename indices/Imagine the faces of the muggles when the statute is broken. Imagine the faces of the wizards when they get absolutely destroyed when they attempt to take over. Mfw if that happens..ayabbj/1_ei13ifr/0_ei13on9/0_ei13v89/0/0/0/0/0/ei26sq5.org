What the he'll are portkey bombs? Wizards can't send nukes. Apperate is an advantage. Not everyone cast a fiendfyre, its extremely dificult to master and can be fatal to the witch/wizard that casted it.Liquid luck can't and was never produced in mass so that's not an advantage. And wizards aren't as versed in war and combat as trained soilder are.
