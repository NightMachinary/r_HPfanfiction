  Wizards might use memory charms etc to manipulate the leaders of the muggle world? Well, once the war begins, muggle leaders are going to be hiding in fortified bunkers with dozens of guard
#+end_quote

Again, not sure why you stole this comment twice, but I answered it too.

#+begin_quote
  However, if the wizards change to guerilla tactics, it would be nearly impossible to eradicate them. Invisibility cloaks, disillusion, muggle-repelling wards etc would make the survivors extremely hard to find
#+end_quote

What survivors? Muggles couldn't even begin fighting them. But he is correct. Wizards would be impossible to find and battle. Hell, if they wanted to, they could hide their entire community under Fidelius. What would the muggles do then?

#+begin_quote
  As for a one-to-one fight between a wizard and a muggle? A wizard would win. H
#+end_quote

Agreed.

#+begin_quote
  However, a muggle soldier vs an Auror? Aurors and Wizards are not trained to kill. Muggle soldiers are.
#+end_quote

Not entirely accurate. Some Muggle Soldiers still just shoot blindly hoping to hit somebody because they can't will themselves to kill. And, Wizards can kill rather easily even if they are Untrained. Harry had no problem killing Quirrell. The order of the Pheonix encouraged killing their foes. Death Eaters had no problem with killing. Aurors had no problem with killing in the first Wizarding War. And lets assume he is right, he is not, Muggle has no choice but to kill. Wizard does. He can flee via portkey(love how you never adressed the portkey bombs) or apparation. They can easily knock out, paralize, or make the muggle unable to aim by cursing them to dance. I could make a huge list of things a wizard can do to defeat a muggle while not killing him. By the way, not all Muggles have wands, but all Wizards have wands. Hence, not all Muggles are armed, but all Wizards are.

#+begin_quote
  And muggle military personnel alone are probably superior in numbers compared to the entire wizarding world
#+end_quote

And that matters why exactly? In an hour, Wizards could easily reduce Muggle population by half or more. Apparate, Fiendfire, apparate out. Rinse and repeat. Or make the Muggle Governments nuke eachother. What else? Wizards could easily crash Muggle economy therefore disabiling the army and everything else. Muggles do need equipment while Wizards don't. They can dublicate all they need. Wizards could easily cut Muggles of electricity. Destroy all internet servers. Have the Governments use rockets to destroy the satellites. What would Muggles do then? No money, no electricity, no internet, no tv, no equipment, ect.

#+end_quote

Not sure why you repeated this again, but I already answered it.

#+begin_quote
  And I almost forgot another key factor - speed. Let's say Wizarding Britain and Wizarding Bulgaria decide to attack muggle France. Fudge sends a message by owl. The owl would take several days to travel to Bulgaria.
#+end_quote

...did you forget that Wizards can teleport? Fudge could just floo over to Bulgaria in a second. Not that he'd need to. One Dark Wizard could easily destroy all of Muggle France. Hell, Muggle France is doing a great job at that by itself.

#+begin_quote
  In comparison, Theresa May gives Putin a call. “Let's attack Wizarding France.” “Sure. “ Within 15 minutes, both sides would have already scrambled a squadron of fighter jets each. Within 4 hours, both countries would have a battalion-sized force ready.
#+end_quote

In comparison, Fudge tells his forces to defeat Muggle France and in an hour its destroyed. They can easily destroy it economically or physically. Oh, btw, how exactly would Muggle forces attack or enter Muggle France? Please let me know. Because I don't think they can. Even if they did know it existed.

#+begin_quote
  Edit: Also, you don't need to see something to hit it. You can fire artillery by aiming at a "hole" in the map
#+end_quote

The charms will not make it look as a hole. It will make it look as something completely normal by Muggle standarts. Hogwarts, for example, has this protection.

#+begin_quote
  And again, good luck hitting tactical nuclear warheads as they come at you at supersonic speeds.
#+end_quote

I'm sorry, are you stupid? Do you really think Britan would nuke itself? Or that America would? And even if they did, which is moronic, Wizards easily lived through WW2 bombings, which involved the bombing of London. They easily survived with no damage, so we can logically assume they are protected from bombs.

#+begin_quote
  Also, you'd need to track down all missile submarines before they can launch, and again, good luck with that.
#+end_quote

I'm sure Wizards would have a big problem with this. It's not like they control the Muggle Government and could get the locations...Oh, wait. They do control it. And they can get the locations.

#+begin_quote
  That's why it's completely stupid and total wizard wank if someone thinks they could be intercepted by some spells in the flight. The obvious counter to that are SSBNs. Good luck finding every single missile submarine with standing orders to launch should their country fall. Each is capable of turning earth into a nuclear wasteland. Especially the Russian Typhoons, which have the same displacement as a treaty battleship.
#+end_quote

I already answered all of the parts of this up above.

#+begin_quote
  nevermind wizards whose experts are too stupid to consider buying a book to answer the question "what are rubber ducks for".
#+end_quote

This argument is so stupid. Sure Arthur is curious what are ruber ducks for. Are there books explaining that? No. The ruber ducks serve no purpose except to entertain you in bath. Or your dog. And even if there is a book on rubber ducks, he might not be actually curious enough to look for it and buy it. And Arthur was smart enough to figure out how his car and Sirius' bike worked and enchant them. He even added Nitro to Sirius' bike. I can be curious as to how cakes are made but I won't nececarelly go and look it up. I don't care all that much, just a simple curiousity. By your argument I'm stupid. That is one of the worst arguments you could have stated.

#+end_quote

Why do you keep repeating stuff over and over again? It makes your points seem even less valid.

#+begin_quote
  It's nearly impossible for the navies which do that for a living, nevermind wizards whose experts are too stupid to consider buying a book to answer the question "what are rubber ducks for".
#+end_quote

Stop repeating your words.

So, you stole this dudes comments. Good job. And you failed to adress even a single point I made in my last one.
