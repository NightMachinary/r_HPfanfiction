  I'll let you deal with this. These are comments of logical people
#+end_quote

What logical people? And why can't you debunk my arguments yourself like I'm doing?

#+begin_quote
  As the battle prolongs, the wizards lose their advantage of having superior knowledge.
#+end_quote

I legit never stated that they had superior knoeledge. But they do. And they lose none of it. You are of course free to debunk my comment, but seeing as you are simply using someone elses comments to try to debunk my words without adressing any of it, I doubt you will.

#+begin_quote
  Many of the commenters here seem to have no idea how the military works
#+end_quote

Neither do you, I'd think since you are increadibly wrong on all the possible counters.

  Attack Gringotts and Wizarding Britain falls
#+end_quote

Not at all. Wizarding Britan's economy is vastly diffrent to muggle one. They don't actually need it. I'll link my comment explaning their economy. Here you go:

#+begin_quote
  You are looking at the wizarding economy like a muggle. Muggles operate on supply and demand, but Wizards don't have to. They have infinite supply of most things. The currency is there for convienience. Sure you can transfigure yourself a pretty nice table, or you can give a shopowner who has better transfiguration skills a few sickles to do it for you. Very little things in Wizarding world have any real value. The textbooks and brooms and rarer potion materials are the only things I cam think off and that's only because duplicating them is not really gonna work long-run. You don't want your book to go bad in the middle of the year, or your broom failling you mid-match. For example of their purchasing power you could use book two. The Weaseleys managed to buy all of the school supplies(bar wands, of course) for 5 of their kids for only a single galleon. If you had a thousand you would likely be one of the most powerful/influencial people in Wizarding Britain
#+end_quote

If Wizarding Britan loses all of its currency they'll simply make a new one with Zero loses.

  Goblin guards? Send an infantry battalion.
#+end_quote

That may be the only fair point you have made this entire debate, and you stole that from someone else. Good job. And its only a fair point since we don't know much about how Goblins fight and their equipment. I could point out the Goblin Rebelion of 1612 against Wizards as proof of Goblin power, but I'm sure you're gonna ignore it either way.

#+begin_quote
  ragon? Send an armour battalion.
#+end_quote

First of all, that's not a thing. Simple Google Search will show you that Armour Battallion is an infantry unit used by the Norwegian Army. It does have some tanks, so I assume the person you stole this comment from meant tanks. Secondly that person appears to be incapable of actual logic. Tanks are very slow. Dragons are very fast. While the tank shell itself is rather fast it actually needs to aim and hit the Dragon. And said Dragon is capable of evasive maneuvers making the tank increadibly hard to aim and hit said Dragon. The Dragons are also increadibly powerful and tough. Some Dragons have scales as tough as steel. They are capable of easily lifting muggle ships. Their flames can melt stone in mere seconds and some boast quite the range for their flames. So it boils down to the fact that Tanks can't hit them, while Dragons can hit Tanks.

#+begin_quote
  Protective charms and wards? Send an artillery battalion.
#+end_quote

Oh, I am sure that tank shells can penetrate all the wards. After all, Diagon Alley was destroyed in the WW2 bombings. Oh, wait! It wasn't. And nothing canonically suggests that they could be penetrated by tanks. Let's assume that they can, for the sake of the argument. The only way they can reach Diagon Alley with their tanks is via the Leaky Couldron. Which is protected by charms that make it invisible to muggles. In fact, they are not even aware that something exists there or anything at all. It's fairy hard to hit something you can't see or comprehend. That's assuming they even know the approximate location of Diagon Alley. What about Gringotts then? Surely it has non protection? What about Thief Downfall? The magic enchantment protecting them against any magical enchantments used by the enemy? That means that they do have magic to use. It could be similar to House Elves or Wizards simply wanted to protect Gringotts against thieves. Either way, it is very likely that they have similar, if not better, protections as Diagon Alley. By the way, how are tanks going to even reach Gringotts?

  Wizards might use memory charms etc to manipulate the leaders of the muggle world?
#+end_quote

I just love how much he seems to be ignoring canon. Or maybe he simply never read the books. Wizards already control the Prime Minister and have infiltrated Wizards within Muggle Government. Anything Wizards want to know about it, they can. If Muggles flee, Wizards will easily follow. After all not even the prime minister knew that some of the men he employed were Wizards. And you know what? Muggles have no way of figuring that out. And it's not simply the memory charm that Wizards could use for manipulation. I mentioned it in my last comment. Let me repeat the list as I can recall it. Memory Charm. False Memory charm for implanting false memories or modifying existing ones. Truth potions for truth. Confundus is basically a weak imperius. Imperius curse. Love potions to make the world leaders madly in love with your Wizarding leader. And that's only on the top of my head. I'm sure if I looked it up, I could find more spells for manipulation that do not involve torture. I could also list plenty of torture spells as well. Oh, wait, just remembered! Someone like Snape, Dumbledoor, Voldemort, Bellatrix, could also use legilimency if they wanted to know something or manipulate the muggles with their deepest fears. I said that in my last comment as well.

#+begin_quote
  Well, once the war begins, muggle leaders are going to be hiding in fortified bunkers with dozens of guards.
#+end_quote

If only the Wizards could use some spells to mind control the guards. Oh wait, they can. If only there were super quick and easy ways to kill them all. Of wait, The Unforgivables and fiendfire. I could list some more. And before you say that Unforgivables are super hard to cast or require you to be a dark wizard, consider this. Harry Potter easily used the Imperius Curse. Harry Potter easily used the Cruciatus when a death eater spat at his teacher. During the first Wizardinf War the Unforgivables were allowed to be used by Aurors and they did so with no great difficulty. I already explained the Fiendfire one in my last comment. If you need me to explain that again, feel free to ask. Let's continue. If only Wizards could somehow change their appearance to fool Muggle guards...oh wait. They can. Polyjuice, invisibility cloaks, disillusionment charm, Animagus, Human Transfiguration. Do I need to go on and on about why this is a stupid argument? An argument that you didn't even see fit to make yourself and instead stole from someone else.
