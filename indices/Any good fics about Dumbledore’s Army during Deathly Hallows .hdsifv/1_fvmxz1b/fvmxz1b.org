Depends on what you mean 'about' Dumbledore's Army. If you mean a fic solely focused on their actions, thats probably pretty sparse. There are, however, a number of fics about Deathly Hallows from the perspective of those involved in the DA though. Some better ones include:

- linkffn(The Changeling): a Slytherin-Ginny AU, mostly the last four chapters, a brilliant read for the characterizations and journey seen.
- linkffn(An Interview with Justin Finch-Fletchley): JFF talks to Lee Jordan about the time during Deathly Hallows and the immediate aftermath in a radio interview format.
