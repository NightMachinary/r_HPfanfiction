Presuming it's the one I'm thinking about (I do believe it is “The Power of the Press”), it's a Bobmin fic. That should serve well enough in explaining the “why” of it, even if it still doesn't make sense.

If there are other fics with the same stuff happening then I really have no idea but I can say that the way prophecies work is so vague that many an author probably use them as an excuse for a power-up of some sort.
