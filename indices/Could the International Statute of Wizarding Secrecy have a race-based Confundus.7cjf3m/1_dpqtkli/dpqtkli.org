I think it's a bit more fundamental than that: Muggles miss magic which occurs before their eyes because it is not part of their world view and their expectations mold their reality. So it is, for example, that Muggles fail to notice the Knight bus not because it has Muggle repelling Charms, but rather simply because it is so beyond their capabilities to comprehend something so absurd.
