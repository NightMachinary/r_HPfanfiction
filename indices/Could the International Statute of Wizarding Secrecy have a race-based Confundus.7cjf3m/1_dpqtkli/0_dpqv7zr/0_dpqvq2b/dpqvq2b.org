I think you're under-estimating the effect. Remember that the Knight Bus causes entire buildings to jump around in space in order to get out of the way. The Muggles fail to notice this not because they are confunded, but because they have a kind of psychological anti-magic defence which prevents them from realising that something is magic, not just when they miss it in passing, but also when it is staring them directly in the face.

  “Best go wake up Madam Marsh, Stan,” said Ern. “We'll be in Abergavenny in a minute.”

  Stan passed Harry's bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase. Harry was still looking out of the window, feeling increasingly nervous. Ernie didn't seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel. The Knight Bus kept mounting the pavement, but it didn't hit anything; lines of lampposts, mailboxes, and trash cans jumped out of its way as it approached and back into position once it had passed.

  “What, Voldemort?” said Harry, without thinking.

  Even Stan's pimples went white; Ern jerked the steering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus.

You will also find references to this effect in Fantastic Beasts. There are footnotes about a book written by a wizard about the effect: The Philosophy of the Mundane: Why the Muggles Prefer Not to Know by Mordicus Egg
