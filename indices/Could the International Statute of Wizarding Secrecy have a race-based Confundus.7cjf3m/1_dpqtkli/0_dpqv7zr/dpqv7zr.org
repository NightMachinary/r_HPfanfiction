I can see what you mean, but I think there's quite a big difference here.

Muggles, in my mind, are willing to forgive certain things because there's just /obviously/ a more reasonable explanation for what they've just seen.

If you saw something flash super quickly before your eyes, how many likely possibilities would you go through before accepting some mundane answer? Possibly one your brain just automatically fills in for you, even. The likelihood of you jumping to and accepting "magic" as the answer is /fairly/ low, even for a Harry Potter fan.

/That/ type of missing magic is /much/ different than being wholly incapable of even /properly pronouncing the words/.
