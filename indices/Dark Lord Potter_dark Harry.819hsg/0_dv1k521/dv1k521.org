Hmm. I can't say that he's a Dark Lord, but he certainly is far from good. He has no moral compass and causes mayhem by [[/spoiler][turning the entire freaking world into a desert so that only the strong survive.]] It may get a lot of hate around here but linkffn(Worthy of Magic by Sage Ra) is well written, has a very unique character in Harry, as well as great characterization of Daphne. Overall a fic that I think you'd like, even though he isn't a "Dark Lord" per se but still manages to change the world just because he thinks its right because he can. Ron and Hermione do not have large roles in this fic, there is no romance in it either.
