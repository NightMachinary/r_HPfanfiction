Harry is only "irrelevant" in as much as he's not involved in researching spells - unlike Dumbledore, who plays a major role there. Harry's still the (much) better fighter and flyer than Hermione, and there's ample combat in the story to make him and Ron relevant, in my opinion. And that's not even counting Harry's much, much more important social position there.

More importantly, though, in "Patron", both Harry and Hermione would be called "irrelevant" according to your standards when compared to Dumbledore. He's the one who directs the war, mentors and supervises Hermione's spell research, and handles politics. And when it comes to fighting, the most active character is Aberforth, handling "problems" all over Europe for the brother he loathes. So, it's really more a matter of how important you judge the things Harry and Hermione contribute to the war when you judge relevancy. There'are Harry's visions for intel on Voldemort's actions, Harry's fame and reputation and influence on his fellow students as well as individual fighting skill, and Hermione's research into new spells. But without Dumbledore, all of this would have been irrelevant since Voldemort would have walked over them without trouble.
