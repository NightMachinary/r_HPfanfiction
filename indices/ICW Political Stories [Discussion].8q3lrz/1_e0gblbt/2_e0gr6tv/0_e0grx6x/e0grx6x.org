Far more helpful and loyal than in canon. Though frankly, Harry kinda of is irrelavant along with him when compared to Hermione, who becomes something akin to a savant (yeah its that kind of fic). I wouldn't discard it for that, there really isn't bashing, more along the lines of turning Hermione's abilities up to 11 while leaving Harry and Ron about equal at respectable 7.
