[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13448485/1/A-Different-Kind-of-War]] this is probably one of my favorite. Hasn't been updated in a couple of months though.

There is another one where Fleur is a romantic interest, but it's a multi pairing fic where no one girl has been set in stone and I'm not sure Fleur will end up being the winner (or one of the winners) but judging from what I have read so far she's probably still in the race in the story. I'm being careful with this fic. It's extremely well done, but if I invest too much time into it and Fleur isn't with Harry in the end I'm doing to be majorly disappointed. With all that said this is the other fic.
