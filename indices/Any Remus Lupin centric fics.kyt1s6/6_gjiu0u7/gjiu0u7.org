[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon][Against the Moon]] is a favorite of mine. It's tragically unfinished, but the author is an incredible writer. It's about a young Remus, and I still get chills how the werewolf revelation was written. All four Marauders feel very real and age appropriate

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16126862/chapters/37676804][Wolf, Wolf]] is another of my favorites...and I can't explain why without revealing spoilers.
