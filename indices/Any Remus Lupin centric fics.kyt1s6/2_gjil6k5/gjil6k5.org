Hey [[/u/WhistlingBanshee][u/WhistlingBanshee]] I remember you recommending ATYD and just finished it. It's. Phenomenal. Feel like it spoils me for a lot of other fanfics. Admittedly I skimmed some parts like Remus/Grant's relationship after the first war but jeez it was incredible. I do think they could have shown Peter to be more suspicious though, or maybe those were in the parts I skimmed. I know the author has other smaller works but would love a sequel! Thanks for the rec!!
