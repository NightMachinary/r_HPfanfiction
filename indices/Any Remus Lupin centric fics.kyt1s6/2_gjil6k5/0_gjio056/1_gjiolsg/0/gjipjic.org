I skimmed the sex scenes too ðŸ˜„. You can, they don't add to the plot so you're not missing anything dont worry ðŸ˜Š. Yeah smut isn't my sort of thing at all I get that. But the story is good. Chapter 20 is the Peter chapter and you can read that as a standalone. It's a brilliant character study. Genuinely amazing.
