Haaa on brilliant I'm glad!!! I'm so glad you liked it!

Grant will always have a special place in my heart but I get why you skimmed those bits. The Bootleg Tapes and Out of the Blue are the side stories and really worth the read I promise.

Yes I do think they could have done that with Peter but also... I dunno, since we only see things from Remus's point of view and Remus never suspects peter it kinda makes sense?

They're other fic Dress Up In You is also well worth the read!

And if you want to see a fic with a suspicious Peter, linkao3(Remain in Light by veeagainst) has the most incredible Peter chapter. The whole fic is brilliant (but explicit... Warning). Sirius doesn't die in OoTP and it's how him and Remus get back together and fight the war? With flashbacks and insights. And it's just brilliant! Recommend. Thanks for remembering me!!!
