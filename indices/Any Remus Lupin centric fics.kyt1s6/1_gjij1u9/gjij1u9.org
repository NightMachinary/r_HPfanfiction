I've seen /The Bureaucratic Error/ linkffn(13052940) recommended quite a bit. It's on my list to read, but I haven't yet, so this is more an observation of its existence and popularity than an actual rec. It's a "newly-dead Remus time-travels back to third year" fic.

I rather liked /A Lonely Path/ linkffn( 5411398). It's a "Harry ran away and never went to Hogwarts" fic that catches up with Harry when he's 14 or 15 or so. Remus is the only one that Harry will initially trust, and there's a lot of "found family" and angst happening. It was completed kinda recently after a really long hiatus. I didn't care for the ending much at all, since it felt rushed and tacked-on to me. Nonetheless, you may enjoy it if you're into those tropes. No romance that I recall, though there could be wolfstar at the end. It was so fast I don't really remember.

I don't know why you're getting the NSFW warning. I'm amused wondering if it's because of the confluence of terms in your post like "hard," "juicy", and "romance."
