Quote from Prince of Slytherin but I fully agree. The stuff the Dursley's did to Harry would mess him up for good if this was real life.

That said, the author of PoS notes that “young child has abusive relatives but overcomes them to end up fine” is a staple trope in british fiction. Oliver Twist, Harry Potter, Matilda, James and the Giant Peach, A Series of Unfortunate Events, etc.
