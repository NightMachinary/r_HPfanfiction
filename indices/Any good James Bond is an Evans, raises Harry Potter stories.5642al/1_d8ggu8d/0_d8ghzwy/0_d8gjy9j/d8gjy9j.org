But more seriously, you may like [[/u/starfox5]] 's linkffn(Uncle Quentin's Spy). I haven't read it, but it seems similar. Hermione's great-uncle secret society spy trains her (or something like that). I think I ran across one where the Squib relative of the Weasleys was a spy. Or one where a Squib spy Black raises Harry.

I'll have to look when I get home!
