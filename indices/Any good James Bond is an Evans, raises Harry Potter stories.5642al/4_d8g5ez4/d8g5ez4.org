The only one I enjoy is linkffn(Agent Double O Hex)

Only about 8 chapters but is a fun romp especially since the implications of Magic in a world with MI-6 and other organizations basically makes the world silly puddy. The later chapters play around with puberty in a funny way. It's more of a Harry Potter Crack Fic with James Bond but I still recommend it as the James Bond flavour effects EVERYTHING.
