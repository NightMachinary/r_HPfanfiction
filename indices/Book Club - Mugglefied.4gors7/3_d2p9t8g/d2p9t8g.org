I thought 'Mugglefied' was /okay/. I didn't feel as if there was much character development. Draco and Hermione start off pretty neutral to each other and then grow to like each other -- in fact Hermione is nice to him almost immediately! I would appreciate a bit more struggle and angst - surely they should have more residual negative feelings towards each other.

That said, if you're bored of angsty Dramione, this fic should do just fine. It's simple and not too fluffy.
