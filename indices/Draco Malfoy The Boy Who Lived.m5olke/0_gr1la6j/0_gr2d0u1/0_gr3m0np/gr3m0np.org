Perhaps, except that whole interpretation of it is a mess. Seventh month since when? There is no reason to believe it had to be the seventh calendary month. I wrote about it in linkao3(22663204) ... we don't know exactly when the prophecy was given, but if it was November 1980, then seventh month from then, would be June 1981, right (which would fit Draco)? Or what about seventh month of the parents's marriage, that would be juicy scandal, right? Or do you know that the seven months is considered the shortest possible length of pregnancy for baby to survive?
