The Order, including Dumbledore, usually aren't shying away from killing in my stories. In "Patron", Order members are killing in battle - Sirius, Harry, Ron, Tonks, Aberforth, and of course Moody. Among the POV characters are also two Aurors, who investigate the Death Eater cases - and aren't too shy about using lethal force either in a fight.
