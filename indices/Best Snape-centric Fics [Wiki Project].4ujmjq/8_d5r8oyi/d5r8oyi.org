*Never Say Remember*

Genre: Drama

link: linkffn(3983170)

Status: Complete

Thought: One of the very few fics that has Snape as a believable father figure. It also has the most believable take on Snape/Lily that I've seen; the moral complications involved in that relationship is glorious. The contrast between the Harrys and the Snapes of the two universes is stark, yet they're believably in character.
