*A Difference in the Family: the Snape Chronicles*

*Genre:* drama, tragedy

*Link:* ffn(A Difference in the Family by Rannaro)

*Status*: Complete

*Thoughts*: An extensive expansion of the character from his early days living outside Manchester, through the time of the books and up until his death. The school-age years appear to have been written later as they show a more personal and immersive style, littered with all sorts of real-world touchstones, in particular about the space race. Unapologetically revisionist and pro-Snape, it still draws you in and provides an interesting take on the one of the series' most interesting characters.
