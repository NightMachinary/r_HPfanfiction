linkffn(A Difference in the family by Rannaro)

Your description is on point. Just like to link my own review */[[https://redd.it/3paqd5][here]]/* with all the information on it (other sites, a history, etc).

  The Snape Chronicles is the most unappreciated fanfic on FFnet, and I'm not just saying that. It takes you from before Snape was born right to his death, and no part is skipped over. Usually any fanfic makes Snape out to be a bitter, petty old man or a romanticized anti-hero, but this fic portays him differently than we usually see. It takes in, not just his wizarding aspect, but the muggle half of Snape as well, with topics like the space race and social issues of northern England. With what little (but yet so much) JK Rowling gives us about Snape, Rannaro fills in everything. Even if you hate Snape (or love him), read it. Keep in mind, this is not just HP book 1-7 in Snape's point of view, it takes a whole lot of time and chapters to even get to Harry's sorting.
