  This started out as a crack-fic idea. Then I started writing it, and it decided it wanted to be much more than crackfic---and much, much longer as well! The thank you list for this one is equally massive: first, to everyone at the severusharrybb community---thank you for the cheering, the pep-talks and the glimpses at all your WIPs; you kept me going when frustration with JKR's plotholes and fear of deadlines made it tough to keep going. To the mods for putting such hard work into organising this big bang, with extra special thanks to accioslash for much needed honesty when I was angsting over the ending of this which prompted the brainwave I needed. To my britpicker rycolfan for her reassurance, badgerlady for whipping my typos and M-dashes into shape, and abrae for a fantastic and thorough beta (the semicolon is dead; long live the semicolon!) and her immeasurably kind words. â™¥ And last, but not least, to my artist---I hope you've had as much of a blast illustrating this as I have had writing it!A/N 2: Any scenes/dialogue quoted and adapted from the books are JKR's property and used purely for transformative purposes; I lay no claim to them and make no money off them whatsoever.

  Severus Snape is thirteen. Riding the train back to King's Cross. He's watching London rise up out of green fields dotted with sheep. The train rushes over bridges and through tunnels covered in graffiti. The vibration of the train is rhythmic, like blood whooshing through a jugular.
