*Genre:* Angst/Drama

*Link:* linkffn(Stronger than Hope by Alaunatar)

*Status:* Complete

*Thoughts:* This is perhaps the only mentor!Snape fic that does not whitewash Snape's character. In this, he is his sarcastic, bitter, self-interested, obsessive and unwholesome self that we see in canon. While it is built on a very angsty Harry background, it is not nauseating, and is relatively plausible.
