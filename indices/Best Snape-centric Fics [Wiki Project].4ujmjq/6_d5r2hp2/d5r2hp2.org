*I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love*

*Genre:* Drama

*Link:* linkffn(I Know Not, And Cannot Know, Yet I Live and I Love)

*Status:* Complete

*Thoughts About It*: Luna/Snape friendship, canon-compliant. The author doesn't shy away from portraying Snape's flaws, and at the same time makes him out to be really human and gives an insight into why he behaves the way he does. The interactions between Luna and Snape are just hilarious (at least in the beginning) and sweet and emotional. Really made me appreciate Luna even though I do not normally care much for her character.

*The Professor's Discretion*

*Genre:* Drama/Comfort

*Link:* linkffn(The Professor's Discretion)

*Status:* Complete

*Thoughts About It:* A very realistic take on Snape/Hermione friendship, their characterizations are completely spot on. Follows somewhat AU year 6/7. Starts off a little slow, but becomes quite interesting and develops one of the more complex, dynamic connections between two characters that I have seen. Really great writing.
