*The Apprentice*

*Genre:* Drama

*Link:* linkffn(6306296)

*Status:* Abandoned

*Thoughts:* The best Snape redo fic I've read. The best part of the story is Snape working in the potions shop as an apprentice; his relationship with Master Jigger is really well done, and Potions as a subject is nicely explored. The story is Snape/Lily as well, but it is not really the focus. Unfotunately abandoned, but there's some really good stuff there.
