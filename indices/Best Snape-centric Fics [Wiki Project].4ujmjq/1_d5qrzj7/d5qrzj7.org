*In which Snape befriends an old grey donkey*

*Genre:* Friendship/Family/Humour

*Link:* linkffn(4903653)

*Status:* One-shot, Complete

*Thoughts About It:* A lovely little story in which Snape accidentally apparates to the 100-acre wood. Set during HP & the Philosopher's Stone, it's a short look at Snape not as a tragic anti-hero, or as an evil murderer, but as a man, written with a very deadpan sort of humour.
