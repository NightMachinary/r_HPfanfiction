*Happiness is a Broken Wand*

Genre: Adventure, Crossover

Link: linkffn(6430570)

Status: Abandoned

Thoughts: A very rare LotR cross which has /actual canon divergence/. As another welcome bonus, it has actual conflict with Snape suffering heavy setbacks. On the flip side... the writing is no more than serviceable, the starting isn't the smoothest, magical cores exist and it is abandoned. Which are some pretty heavy drawbacks, but the positives are pretty huge, and my general feeling after reading it was that of enjoyment, with a familiar tinge of frustration over its abandonment. I would recommend it to those who don't absolutely hate abandoned fics.
