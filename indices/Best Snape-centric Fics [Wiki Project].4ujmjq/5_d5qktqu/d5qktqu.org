*A Dream Carved In Stone*

*Genre:* /Drama/Romance/

*Link:* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8134710/1/A-Dream-Carved-in-Stone]]

*Status:* complete

*Thoughts:* It's the only Lily Evans/Severus Snape fic I've ever read, and likely the /only/ one I'll ever read. The writing quality is uniformly excellent, the characterisations are all mostly believable, and it manages to somehow redeem a Snape who is already a Death Eater (albeit slowly and painfully). However, it's been quite a while since I've read this one, and I can't remember many details.
