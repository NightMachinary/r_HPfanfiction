Hard to say. If we keep the fanon interpretation of Lavender, it doesn't mean that Harry will become this super chatty and gossip spreading person.

I would hope it would make him less closed off and sullen, but he may still keep overwhelmed by Lavender's larger than life personality. That said, having a supportive family (I would assume this is the case), will make certain things easier for him and would hopefully give him a solid grounding in the magical world.
