I have gone through 14 million scenarios without staying too OOC and I have narrowed down to 3 valid ones:

1. Harry hits his head with a bludger. Goes insane. Escapes to marry Bella in secret. They set on a lovely cottage where they can fill the walls with the heads of all their unfavorite elves.

2. Harry gets hit with a lust potion. Shags Bella's brains out. Gets her pregnant. Out of selfless obligation to the kid decides to stay with her. Names their child Rudolph Severus Potter.

3. Bella gets cursed with a "If you ever do a dark spell again your clothes will turn pink forever" so has to step down from being a Death Eater. ATTENTION. This scenario requires a secret-dark-drunk bethroyal Contract signed by James and Sirius.
