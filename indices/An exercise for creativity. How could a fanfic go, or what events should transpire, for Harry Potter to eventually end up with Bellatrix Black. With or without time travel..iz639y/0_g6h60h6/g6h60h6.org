There is exactly one way if you don't want time travel. After she is broken out of Azkaban, BEFORE the DoM battle, Bellatrix defects because she never wants to go back there, ever. Which leaves her exactly one option, betting everything on Harry (or running for the rest of her life, but that seems more of a Lupin thing).

So you now have a seriously unhinged magical destruction machine with only one way forward. Taking down Voldemort. But since he's a bit too far up the food chain, that means dealing with the other Death Eaters.

If you want that plot to turn into a romance, have them slowly develop feelings as they spend years fighting together. Have them save each other lives, starting in the DoM. But it should really be a lengthy process since I don't think that Bellatrix would be trusted quickly.
