Some Bella&Sirius bonding is always good, as is a Bellatrix&Andromeda reconciliation. If Bellatrix starts taking out Death Eaters, Voldemort will need more manpower, so maybe some of the darker magical creatures appear as enemies more frequently.

Also, keep in mind that Bellatrix might reject Voldemort, but she won't suddenly be a good person.
