Alright, so the initial meeting should be outside of Grimauld place since Bella might actually remember the neighbourhood even if she can't find the house. So that would probably be the first scene, and Harry does not buy her change of heart at all. He'd demand some proof, but would unsure what exactly.

So Bellatrix reluctantly leaves and eventually returns with some Death Eater captured/dead, which starts a series of such acts. Have her join the DoM battle on Harry's side, maybe replacing Ginny, Luna and Neville. Speaking of Neville, he would immediately lose all respect for Harry and the only thing stopping him from informing the authorities would be a lack of evidence.

Maybe have Bellatrix sneak into Hogwarts to give the trio lessons.

Maybe have an attack on Hogsmeade with her defending the place with the limitation that she cannot be seen/identified.

As for the romance, maybe get some alcohol involved to start things, but afterwards it's a struggle between "we should not be doing this again" and "I want to do it again".
