We are talking about Bellatrix Lestrange here, to be honest creepy would be a given even if they were the same age.

As for the age, actually it would be a mutual dependency, so I'm not really sure how the power imbalance would work out since Harry could sell her out at any moment.

It would definitely be a little challenging to do such a relationship justice.
