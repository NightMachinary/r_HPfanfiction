One possible way is something I've been searching for in a fic and only found in one fic in a believable way (well, as believable as wizards, witches, and magic can be). The circumstances would have to have an evil/dark/grey Harry who somehow convinces Bella that he IS the Dark Lord reborn because seriously, I don't really think it'll take much to convince her that greatest Dark Lord of the time wasn't, in fact, defeated by a baby but actually took over his body.

It's later in the story but overall, the story is pretty interesting.

This fic is Wizard Kingpin by Odin999:
