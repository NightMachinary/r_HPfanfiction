linkffn(Elysium for the Sleepless Souls) is a truly disturbing cosmic-horror-type thing. For a more "fun" sort of scare, linkffn(That Which Holds the Image by RubbishRobots) is a /Doctor Who/ crossover bringing the Weeping Angels to Hogwarts, and, I mean, it's the Weeping Angels, how does it not /count/ as scary?
