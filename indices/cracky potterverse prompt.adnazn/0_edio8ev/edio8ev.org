Well, it's not exactly a familiar bond - but in my story "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief", the animagus transformation has the animal influence the wizard, in both forms. Of course, Hermione thinks she can handle it, and doesn't realise how she is starting to take on cat-like habits - sleeping in, napping in the sun, fussing about dust on her robes, defending her territory, being too curious (and prideful) for her own good, and so on. Sirius, on the other hand, is a dog - and they often act like cats and dogs.
