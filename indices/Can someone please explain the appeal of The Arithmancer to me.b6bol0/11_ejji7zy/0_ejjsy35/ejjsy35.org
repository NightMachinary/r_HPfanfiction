I think you hit the nail on the head for why I like The Arithmancer so much ... Hermione's OPness comes mainly from her general intelligence and her math skills (clearly defined attributes).

I would also add that though she is OP, she still faces challenges, and unlike traditional power-wank fics her interactions with others feels very organic.
