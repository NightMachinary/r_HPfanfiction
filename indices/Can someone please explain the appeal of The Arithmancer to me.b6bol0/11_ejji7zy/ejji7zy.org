It's a wish fulfilment power fantasy where Hermione is the main character and has the skillset to save the day.

No different - except in many ways, imo, better reasoned and supported - than any of the many Powerful!Harry fantasies where Harry has all sorts of powers, is The Sole Hero rather than part of a team, or, if part of a team, is much more powerful or variedly powerful than anyone else who may as well be set dressing, and/or is the sole focus of the story.

I would even go as far as to say canon falls slightly into this in as much as Harry usually saves the day, often by chance, dumb luck, inherited power or McGuffins that happens to be the exact thing needed to save that particular situation.

Ultimately it's just the author's sandbox and probably is written with fans of Hermione the character in mind, and for that reason centers on her. Take it for what it is, a lighthearted what if. Could be that you just aren't the target audience if that's not something you enjoy to read about.
