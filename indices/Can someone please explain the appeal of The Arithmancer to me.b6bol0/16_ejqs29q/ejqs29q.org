Female empowerment! Seriously, as far as I know most fanfiction writers are women (that's why there's so much slash out there, because most men don't write that as they don't think men are attractive and especially not gay men!) and women like female empowerment (it's what feminism does these days! Gone are they days most feminists just wanted equal rights! No, these are the days where they believe that doing a 180 of the world the first wave feminists grew up in, so discrimination against men instead of women (women's quotas for great and well payed, but not for shitty manual labor jobs - and that's just one example...another would be unequal healthcare spending! Especially the research...more breast-cancer research than prostate-cancer research, despite the fact that surviving breast-cancer is more likely!)....

​

Otherwise? I don't really know, I am not a Hermione fan (I don't hate her either), so I don't care for this fanfiction (have tried reading it, but it wasn't that interesting to me :( )

​

ps: Note: I am not against equal opportunities! I am against discrimination in all forms (be they against men, women, gays, religious folks etc.)! Hell, frankly: The most attractive women to me are TOMBOYS!
