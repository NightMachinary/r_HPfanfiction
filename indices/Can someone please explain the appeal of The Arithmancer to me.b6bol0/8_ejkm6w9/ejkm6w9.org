I have mixed feelings about The Arithmancer (and sequels).

When I read the first book I really enjoyed it but I find I can't read it again now. Hermione starts off as utterly wet and suddenly transforms into a world-beating witch capable of almost anything.

The second book was okay but spent way, way too long with the characters faffing about doing not a lot.

The third book wasn't really a story, more a set of points that White Squirrel wanted to make.

The series is certainly certainly original, with its clever use of maths but I felt the characterisation was poor. Others have made the point that Hermione does almost everything and most other characters are largely irrelevant. Other stuff is thrown in for no real purpose; the whole House Elf section of the castle, for instance.

I'm glad I read the series but in the future it'll be one I dip into to find certain scenes rather than re-reading in total.
