I also thought that the spellcrafting got less interesting in the sequel. In the first one, there were plenty of interesting ideas, in the second one it was just "insert nasty disease here", and it only got interesting again when Hermione started dabbling in rituals. Lady Archimedes was still fun for me, but it doesn't have the same magic The Arithmancer had.
