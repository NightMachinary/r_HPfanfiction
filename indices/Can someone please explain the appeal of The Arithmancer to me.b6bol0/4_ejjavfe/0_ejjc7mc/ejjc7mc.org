Like I said, I couldn't even finish the first one, I assume it ends with Hermione making up a spell to kill Voldemort so Harry is utterly useless though. It's so unbelievably recommended on here and I just don't get it, it's basically every OTT Harry fic that gets mocked here but with maths and Hermione.
