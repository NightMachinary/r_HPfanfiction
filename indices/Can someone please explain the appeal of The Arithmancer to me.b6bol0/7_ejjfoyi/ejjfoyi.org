It makes Hermione into a palatable, compelling protagonist for all the readers who read canon HP and disliked the way she was portrayed (bossy, naggy, overbearing, close-minded, and condescending) but thought she had a lot of potential if she had the same abilities but a different personality. It's the same thing that Cultural Anthropology or Starfox5 fanfics do, turning canon Hermione into Badass!Hermione.

Some people like it because as a female protagonist, Hermione can be active and have agency in her own right instead of waiting for Harry to do his Chosen One stuff. A female lead also avoids some of the more annoying relationship tropes and gratuitous objectification that happens in OP powerwank Harry-centric fics that follow a similar fix-it fic premise.
