I think there's a subtle distinction to make - it's not that Harry's actions before the graveyard scene don't /impact/ or influence the story (or the wider world) - they do. Stopping the basilisk is a Big Deal, and would have been far harder without a parselmouth stumbling across the entrance there, just as an example.

After book 4 is when Harry's actions begin to more consciously drive change in the wider world, instead of being more reactive to and self contained within Hogwarts.

For the separation between magical world and the mundane world, those are just following canon unfortunately. So while it would make sense for muggleborn to stay connected & interested in the muggle world... that's not the default setting.
