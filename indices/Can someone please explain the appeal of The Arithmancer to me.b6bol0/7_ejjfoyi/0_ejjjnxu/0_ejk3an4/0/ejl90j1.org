I don't think it works like this. I mean, yes Book 1 and 2 will have the central plot point than canon (some can say that Dumbledore did the stone plot Because Harry would be there, for a minipulative Dumbledore for example, but The muggle Protection Act and Malfoy response are not directly linked to Harry).\\
But After Year 2 I think you can totally separate the story from canon.

-For exemple, the aftermatch of year 2 can be vastly different depending of Harry previous actions. Weasley should win the lottery, but a grieving Weasley family after Ginny death or one that has to deal with the accusions against Ginny because Harry "caught" her or even one who fight Malfoy who has been caught, would not go to Egypt, so Sirius would not see Peter and escape.

-And without Sirius escape, you don't have Peter in Albania to help Voldemort, capturing a witch in the process and creating the whole Tournament plot.

But more seriously, when people complain about non original plot, I think it's less about the central plot, and more about the little events. I remember reading several time a Slytherin Harry asked for a duel in the trophy room the same way it was in Canon. Why would he go when Malfoy sleep in the same room as him? And when you have a Malfoy friend, you just replace him with a Stupid! Ron.\\
It's interesting to see how a different caracter would deal with the same situation than canon, but I hate when a different caracter does exactly the same thing as Canon even when it should be totally OOC for him.
