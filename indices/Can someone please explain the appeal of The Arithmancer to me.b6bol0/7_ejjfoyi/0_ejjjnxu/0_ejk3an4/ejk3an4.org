Here is the problem : Harry Potter makes not a single fucks worth of difference until after the graveyard scene.

​

Book one - Dumbledore's gonna move that stone into the Castle Regardless as to whether Harry Potter is there or not. Voldemort is gonna come for the stone and he's going to fail weather Harry's there or not. One could argue he's more likely to fail if Harry isn't there as he'll be stuck in front of that mirror.

​

Book two - The chamber of secrets being opened has absolutely nothing to do with Harry Potter and everything to do with Arthur Weasley and his muggle born protection act and Lucius Malfoy. Malfoy slips that diary into Ginny's bag in order to discredit Arthur I don't know if there's some sort of bizarre feud involved as rarely do you see people get into fist fight unless they mutually hate each other (or alcohol is involved). Regardless the chamber is opening whether Harry Potter exists or not.

​

Book three - Unless I'm missing something from books 1, 2, or 3 Harry Potter had absolutely nothing to do with Arthur Weasley winning at the daily prophet's Galleon lottery. The resulting escape of Sirius black in his attempt to murder the ever living f*** out of Peter Pettigrew Has very little to do with Harry Potter. Harry didn't take the picture Harry wasn't in the picture he wasn't involved in any way with the Weasleys and Pettigrews trip to Egypt.

​

Book four - This is the turning point where Harry potter's actions begin to influence the story And Peter Pettigrew having been exposed Goes to find Voldemort and bring him back triggering the plot to get Harry into the graveyard and resurrect Voldemort. This is really the single point In my mind will you can start to diverge from Canon successfully. Up till this point You have to radically Go for the alternate universe where characters are either missing Or alternatively completely different From how they portrayed in Canon As everything up to this point Are entirely events created by adult characters in this world.

​

So I give a lot of slack to stories That end up rehashing the first 3 blocks Making their minor changes Writing out the characters as different than Canon etc .

​

My issue with Arithmancer Is the same issue that I've had with the vast majority of fan fictions That describe the wizarding world As completely cut off From the mundane world. Simple fact is you can't Bring in People from the mundane world who at 11 have experienced a bit of it and certainly absorb the ideas things that are normal in common And expect them to Embrace the magical world just such a degree that they for get completely about the mundane world and all the advancements it has made. The idea That Wizards of an academic intent Professeurs People for whom knowledge is a goal in and of itself Would not be aware Of nuclear physics It's applications in producing power in weaponry The advancement's made By utilizing The hadron collider And really Any respectable yellow paper They could be applicable to their fields of entrance That was published within the past 20 years, Stretches the bounds of disbelief. I am well over the Hill In terms of age And I am not In an academic field However my chosen areas of interest Are as fascinating to me today As they were when I became interested then them as a teenager And I continue to devour All the applicable knowledge the advancement's made And yes even yellow papers.
