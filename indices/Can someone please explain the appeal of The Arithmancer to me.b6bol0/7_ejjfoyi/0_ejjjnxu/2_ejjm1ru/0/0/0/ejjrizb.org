But as an Author you have the power to stop the snowball and make a different avalanche instead. Sirius doesn't have to break from Azkaban and Harry can still be involved in Triwizard Tournament, maybe as a new plot from Lucius Malfoy. Voldemort can still be resurrected in 4th year by a different follower, maybe Bellatrix breaks out of Azkaban while the Ministry is focused on Sirius?

Hell, Voldemort can be resurrected after the end of Hogwarts and that still make the story intersting. How does Auror!Harry or DMLE!Hermione tries to convince The Ministry the truth? When will Dumbledore shared Horcruxes information to Harry? Does he wait until Voldemort return or taking them down while Voldemort is still not a threat?

I agree with you that Accidental Animagus is better on personal conflict than the war. Seeing Hermione breaks down because Trolls guard the Gryffindor tower and trying to find love with George is pretty interesting.
