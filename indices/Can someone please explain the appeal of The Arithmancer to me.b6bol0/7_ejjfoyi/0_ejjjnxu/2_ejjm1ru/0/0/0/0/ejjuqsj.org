I'm not the author, so I can't tell you why they wrote their story like they did. If the author wants to do it that way, there's no reason why the deck can't be stacked so that Quirrelmort, the Diary Horcrux, and the Philosopher's Stone are in the castle at the same time. But the whole appeal of following the stations of canon is that it offers the author a consistent set of challenges with an increasing difficulty level as the years go on. One mystery a year, one major issue or antagonist, and one satisfying resolution that the protagonist has to earn before they can "level up".

And the "slow level up" structure is the one that The Arithmancer follows, instead of the "tossed in the deep end from Day One" structure. Whether that's good or bad depends on your taste, and how much fanfic you've read in the past.
