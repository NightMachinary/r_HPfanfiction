I agree with that, but the later events in the books are highly dependent on earlier events snowballing. Voldemort would never have been a threat in Year 7 if Sirius had never seen Fudge's Daily Prophet and broken out. Pettigrew would never have run off to Albania if he hadn't known Sirius was on his tail. Voldemort would never have gotten enough strength to wake Barty Jr. out of stasis mode if he hadn't been helped by Pettigrew. To make Voldemort a villain for the school-aged protagonist requires some elements of canon.

If Voldemort found some way to return on his own time, it would very likely be 30+ years later. And then the MC's school years would be very boring and uneventful.

Looking at it from a writing perspective, recycling the stations is a way to inject external conflict into a story. Conflict and overcoming challenge is the essence of storytelling, and a SuperHermione character is not exactly the type of person to have a crisis of faith or moral struggle that fuels a powerful internal conflict. In the books, her character has always been about the "My Way is the Right Way" approach.
