I don't think Hermione has to face the exact same challenge as canon to portray her as badass. Hermione already shows that she can handle the canon challenges, even if with great difficulty. Showing her facing a different challange and still came up on top shows that she's a bigger badass than canon.

There are a lot of Badass!Hermione that's better than the first five year of Arithmancer series. She led the Muggleborn Resistance in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/31/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], pretending to be a snotty Muggleborn in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][Reverse]], being an Animagus before she turns 13 in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], and she remade the Wizarding World political culture in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13072492/1/Democracy][Democracy]].

TBH I'm a bit disappointed that The Arithmancer is a basically canon rehash. I read TheArithmancer after I read Accidental Animagus first and I'm expecting a different plot with Badass!Hermione. There're a bunch of interesting plot in Accidental Animagus and the most interesting thing in The Arithmancer is how a MathWiz can be a brilliant spell creator.
