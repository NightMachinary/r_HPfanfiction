I put it down to Hermione's successes having more significance (and feeling more meaningful to the reader) if she's shown tackling the challenges she faced in canon and resolving them with even more competence. It underlines the divergence of her character from her canon self, while still providing a baseline of how far she's come. Yes, Hermione /could/ deal with a bunch of OC D.A.D.A. teachers, but it's not as satisfying as watching her put Umbridge in her place.

Going between canon stations and leaving the rails completely is a toss-up for stories, frankly. Some readers hate the stations, but another group of readers would lose interest if the protagonist left Hogwarts to go to Ilvermorny with a cast full of OC's.
