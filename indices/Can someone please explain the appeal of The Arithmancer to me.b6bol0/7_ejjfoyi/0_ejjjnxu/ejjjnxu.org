I would have liked it a lot more if this series had deviated more from canon stations.

White Squirrel is perfectly capable of writing great original plots, as evidenced in year 3 of “The Accidental Animagus”. Unfortunately, this is not extended to other years of the same fic, and to majority of years in the Arithmancer series.

I'm sick and tired of reading the graveyard resurrection scheme over and over again.
