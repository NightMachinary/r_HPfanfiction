Two things I liked: 1) The world building of the castle. The stairs that go up and up and get smaller and everything gets bigger....some of the ideas like that I really thought were interesting. 2) Fred and George as different people with different personalities. I really appreciated that.

I can stand a badass!hermione fic or a badass!harry fic but what mostly turns me away from those fics in the end is the unnecessary long-windedness and too many extraneous side plots. That's why I stopped reading this one.
