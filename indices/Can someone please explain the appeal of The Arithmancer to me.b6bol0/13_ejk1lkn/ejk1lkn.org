I've just started it and so far I like it well enough. I've read so many Harry-centered fics that a well written Hermione fic is like a breathe of fresh air. Author has some pretty interesting ideas on how magic works. I like Hermione exploring Hogwarts trying to understand how it works.

It's ok if you don't like it. Life's short. Read what you want
