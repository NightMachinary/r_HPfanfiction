Hermione has like 2 crises of faith (since she's Christian apparently??), spends a weird amount of time looking into wizards' approach to religion, and also exhibits a pattern of appealing to Christianity on occasion in a more-than-just-colloquial way.

It's not super noticeable if you have grown up in a religious household or surrounded by religion, but if you're from a more secular (or even just not Christian) background, it's too close to her just pulling out a rosary from nowhere sometimes. Specially since I don't remember anything at all that would imply she was ever anything other than maybe culturally, non-practicing default-Anglican.

Even though HP has super Christian ethics throughout it, religion is basically just aesthetic in the books (Christmas exists largely for the purpose of presents) and honestly I like that way more than when it is just... Assumed to be the building block of a worldview, the way some works clearly heavily influenced by the religion of the author can be.
