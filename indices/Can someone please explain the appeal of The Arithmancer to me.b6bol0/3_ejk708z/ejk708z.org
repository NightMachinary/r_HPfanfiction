I have somehow managed to get through the first (which I enjoyed) the second (which had me wincing) and have almost finished the third (which I disagree vehemently in parts).

Someone already mentioned the heavy emphasis on Christianity/religion which did make me slightly uncomfortable although it did make for some good spells. The main appeal for me, as for other people on this thread was the world building and heavy magical theory which is absolutely fantastic.

That being said, what annoyed me THE MOST to the point where I almost wanted to leave a bad review (and I've never left a bad review) was Hermione's insistence on the superiority of the muggle world/technology. Apparently all of the wizarding world's problems come from the fact that they haven't ‘caught up with the muggles' or appreciated the wonderful solutions/intellectual advancements of the muggles. Every other sentence in this series is “well, in the muggle world...” and it drives me crazy!!
