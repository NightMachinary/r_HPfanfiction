I just thought that math and worldbuilding were neat.

It could legit have been a story set 10 years later with lots of different names and a radically different plot. I just liked the math in the magic and the way the worldbuilding was used.

Is the characterization kinda weird sometimes?.. Yeah. Is the stuff with her leaving Hogwarts, etc, also kinda weird and BS? Most certainly. Is the plotting kind of confusing in the way in which it artificially includes more weird math shit for no reason but to make Hermione more important(see: Book 4's new final challenge, and book 1's light encryption numbers thing, etc)? Yup. Could it have been executed better? Of course.

But it has math nerd stuff, an awesome mentor in Professor Vector, and neat worldbuilding. So I like it.

Also, like, it's neat to see burnout in a genius character, since lots of the Genius![character] fics pretend the person also has infinite time and infinite resources and infinite patience.
