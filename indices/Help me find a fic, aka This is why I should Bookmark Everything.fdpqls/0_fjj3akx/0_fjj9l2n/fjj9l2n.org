Holy wow. No unfortunately that's not it, and I don't think I've ever read a fic that long omg! You (both) must be extremely dedicated to read all that! I think the longest I've ever read was 200k... although I sometimes read series with multiple 100k+ fics. Also you reminded me to add an edit to my post (I read 99.99% of fics on AO3, but it's so normal to me that I forgot to mention it). Thank you though! I'm (somewhat) tempted to read this fic... think I'll bookmark it for a rainy week.
