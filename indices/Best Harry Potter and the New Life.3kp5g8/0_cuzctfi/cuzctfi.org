Such a thing isn't possible. It is HPFanfic Law that all Harry Potter and the New Life re-writes must either be abandoned before actually reaching the point the original fic (while not changing anything at all, never really understood how that works) or they must be utterly batshit insane.

Like, the only way anyone's allowed to do a rewrite is after filling in a form:

By adopting this fic you agree to do one (or both) of the following:

- Make no actual changes to the story at all and abandon it after 3 chapters.

- Insert a single really stupid element. Like, say, a Godchild twin for Harry.
