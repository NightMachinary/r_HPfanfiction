I wouldn't recommend any of them. The last couple of them are better than the first few. I still don't understand what a shadow mage is but I'm sure that super duper special 10 year old heir to all 4 founders Harry Sue does though.

*Harry Potter and the Wand of Uru:* Similar premise to the New Life one, much fucking weirder. Even in just the first few chapters this story suffers from special snowflake syndrome so hard it's not even funny. Harry is reincarnated into his 10 year old body for unexplained reasons. When they go to get wands before they head off to Hoggywards Harry is so weird that none of the wands fit him so he gets a super special wand that was left with Ollivander's family when an exiled Asgardian (who happens to be a smoking hot woman) died. When he uses magic with it, he turns into a girl (who happens to be hot) and on top of this, he is apparently the fucking son of Loki or some shit like that and that's never really explained. oh, and all those 10 year old's he's surrounded with? He can't stop fucking thinking about how he fucked all of them when they were older. Stay the fuck away from this one. It's not only unfinished, but it's just /bad/.

*Harry Potter and the New Life:* Instead of a rant, here's an excerpt from the first chapter.

  "Don't worry they are my family too. I am a true earthling or the member of the very first human race. We have more powers then you can even comprehend. We expanded our civilization across the universe. The stronger people amongst us could move from one planet to another in an instant. They could destroy galaxies at their whims. A long time ago before I was born, a deadly war broke out because the people got greedy because of their powers. Our Emperor stopped the war. Barring his allies and family members he took everyone's powers; thus creating the modern day human beings. The theory of evolution is just a hoax created by us to hide our existence. I am the Emperor's youngest son. Recently my own powers were increasing at a rapid rate. Fearing that I may not be able to control myself, I split my essence into two equal parts."

Well.. Okay fine. I lied about the rant. Here it comes. Siriusly? Someone took this shit seriously? This ain't a crack fic so someone out there must've. I skipped around a bit to find some of the better highlights: Harry is the heir to Gryffindor and Slytherin, he's a superspecial shadow mage (whatever the fuck that means) and the Sorting Hat announces to the entire school that he's super duper powerful. (on a side note, fuck the boring ass sorting hat. The only good sorting hat I've seen is in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] where the thing spends it's time insulting everything that moves)

*Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived:* I only read the first few chapters since it didn't really catch my attention. This one's average for what seems to be a fixit fic. It's proofread and has good grammer. The first part follows the original pretty much exactly.

*Harry Potter and the New Lives:* I don't have the force of will necessary to slog through all of this. Again, what the everloving fuck is a shadow mage? On the bright side, the Hat is a sarcastic asshole. As I mentioned earlier, I love that. Too bad we have Harry Sue as the main character instead of it.

*New Lives and New Battles:* It's the same shit as all the others for the first few chapters. I'm sloggin through another variation of this. I'm sure if you squint it's an okay story.
