Okay, everyone keep in mind that Alma talks about things in a different way than most of us. Best not feel offended or anything.

Also for noaacat, if by some chance you're here, remember Ã  lot of people did enjoy your work and hopefully you enjoyed writing it too so don't let anything get to you.

For Alma, as I tell every ranter ever, it's best to rant about your own feelings and not dump on someone else's work. That's not to say you can't dump on people's work but it shouldn't be motivated so much by feelings.

Thanks for listening to my TED Talk
