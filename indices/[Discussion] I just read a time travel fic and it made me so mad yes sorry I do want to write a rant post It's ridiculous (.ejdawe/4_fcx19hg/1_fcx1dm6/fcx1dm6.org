It is highly debatable that "smarter" is to literally sit back and let real, breathing people be murdered because of hypothetical worries over time, compared to the realistic and ethical response of literally stopping those people from being murdered when you KNOW they will be!

And anyway, for that to happen spontaneously out of the blue between third year's end and middle of fifth year? In a year and a half time span? What experiences with time did he even have in fourth or fifth year to bring about this spontaneous growth of his? This total change of view? Nothing canon, that is for sure.

No. Don't even try to explain away spontaneous fanfic author OOC bullcrap. You can't. Because that's all it is. They don't understand the character and they just wanted their nonsense plot to happen so they literally made Harry do a 180 from canon. Not that there was much of a plot to that fic anyways, since Harry just sits on his hands and lets everything happen because THE TIMELINE!!!
