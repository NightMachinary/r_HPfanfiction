It was really frustrating. Not only was the pacing insanely slow (seriously you don't need thousands of words detailing research that goes nowhere), the character decisions made literally no sense. Why on earth would harry ever go to a meeting for death eaters if his goal was to avoid detection? These in story justification is just so weak. And the stories insistence on "preserving the timeline" after major changes have been made was beyond annoying.
