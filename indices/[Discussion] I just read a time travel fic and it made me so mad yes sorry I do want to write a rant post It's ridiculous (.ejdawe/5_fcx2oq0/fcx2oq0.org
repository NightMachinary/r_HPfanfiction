Wow, that's a lot of hate and you really shouldn't post a link to a story that you insult with such hatred. Harry does grow up though after PoA and in Cursed Child he does have the chance to save his parents and decides against it. Think of CC what you want, but I think that decision wasn't ooc for Harry. And the time travel we saw in PoA doesn't actually change the past (more like Novikov's self consistency principle), so maybe Harry internalized that.
