Being intelligent doesn't make you better or superior to other people. The non-jerk ones realize this and don't show off. Make them helpful and generous without delivering multiple /well actually/ speeches showing off their big brain.

The current COVID-19 situation has provided a perfect example of this. Anthony Fauci is an extremely intelligent person and is not a jerk. His boss is the opposite...unintelligent and a huge jerk. Intelligence (or lack of it) doesn't breed people being jerks...hubris and entitlement do.
