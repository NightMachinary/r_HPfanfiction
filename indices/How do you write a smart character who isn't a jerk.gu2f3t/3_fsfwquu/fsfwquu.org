If you're talking about the anti-social factor (which I see you mentioned in another comment), a socially awkward or anti-social character doesn't necessarily have to be a jerk about it. Other people might see them as a jerk or a snob simply because they don't like to be social, but if you make the smart character's motivations clear, they won't come across as a jerk to the reader. You can avoid the know-it-all tendency that often annoys people by making the character less talkative and more internal.
