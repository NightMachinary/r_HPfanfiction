There's a common idea (I can't remember if there's a name for it; probably something like "the teacher's dilemma") that things that you already know feel obvious, so you are surprised that others are not aware of them.

For example, Hermione constantly forgets that no-one else has read "Hogwarts: A History".

When you show that character "A" knows something that character "B" doesn't, "A" can either be frustrated and snarky (as per House, Sherlock, etc), or they can talk too fast and bamboozle "B" but politely apologise and explain the missing steps/details when asked.
