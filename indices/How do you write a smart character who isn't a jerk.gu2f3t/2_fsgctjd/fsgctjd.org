I think the key is to make their 'smartness' as implicit and understated as possible. Don't tell us (the readers) the character is smart through their words or classmates/teachers saying they're smart (and definitely don't put anything like 'smart!Harry' in the fic description). Show the character's intelligence through them being good at magic/thinking up a clever solution to a problem/etc.
