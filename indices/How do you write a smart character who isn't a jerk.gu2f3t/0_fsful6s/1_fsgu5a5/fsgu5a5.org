The first point is so true - in University it's interesting how many times you can ask professors questions that are just slightly outside their specialty, and they will refuse to answer. If you make them guess, chances are they'll guess right since they HAVE spent decades learning things, but half the time they will insist on calling up another professor who knows better than them. But they always make sure you know that they can be wrong if a subject isn't their area, even if to an undergrad it seems close enough
