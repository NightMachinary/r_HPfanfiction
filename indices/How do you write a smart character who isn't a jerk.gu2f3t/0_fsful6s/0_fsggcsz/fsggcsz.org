Yeah, ^{^{100%}} agree. Usually you don't know someone is smart-smart or has done a big accomplishment until they reveal themselves. Ex: say something insightful, bring a new perspective, perhaps ruminate silently while others talk/not loud mouths. (But hey! There are of course variations like the loudmouth that's also a genius)
