Two main things that everyone should remember about intelligent people (as written by myself, a dumb person lol) -

1. Really smart people know how little of the world they actually know about. For example, someone with a Ph.D. knows a *LOT* about their particular field. About any other topic, they know probably as much as anyone else. So don't make your character a genius about EVERYTHING, it is dumb and annoying.
2. Intelligent people aren't constantly showing off how intelligent they are. Have you ever heard of a show called "House"? It was on FOX a few years back, about a doctor who knew so much he could always figure out what was wrong with his patients. Like most shows that feature a 'genius' protagonist, they made him a huge asshole to everyone else, constantly showing off how smart he was and intentionally disrespecting his colleagues. Basically, watch a show like that and make your 'smart' character do the exact /opposite/.

Hope that helps!
