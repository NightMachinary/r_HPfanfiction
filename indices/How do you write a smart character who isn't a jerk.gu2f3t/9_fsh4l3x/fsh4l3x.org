Remember that a lot of smart people (both the kind that are very intelligent/rare geniuses who think in a different way than normal and the kind that have been very well educated, smarter than average, and spent a long time improving themselves) will often be the first to say, "I don't know". They might speculate on something, but I find those of above average intelligence are comfortable acknowledging the limits of their knowledge on any particular topic.

When you get into a room with a bunch of the most senior researchers, globally recognized for their contributions to their field, I've noticed that when asked a question that's slightly outside their specific topic, they will be the first to say, "I'm not an expert on x/y/z. This is what I know about x/y/z based on x/y/z, don't quote me on that."

If you've written something that sounds mean, consider how the same information would be said or shared by a less smart, or nicer, character, and then see how it would fit for the smart character to say the same. Being smart doesn't mean correcting others all the time. Hermione is a good example of someone who is tactless with how she shares information, similar to Draco who makes fun of Harry for not knowing something about the Wizarding world.
