Honestly the whole "I'm a genius so I'm actually a horrible person to other people" is perpetuated in so much media: big bang theory, bones, house, the cumberbatch Sherlock etc...

A good example I think is Charlie from Numb3rs who is a genius but still has good friends and good relationships with his dad and brother. Or Reid from Criminal Minds who is socially awkward but not mean.

Basically, just because someone knows things doesn't mean their character flaws is being mean to people. Think of other character flaws. Maybe they're insecure about their intelligence, or maybe they're smart but impulsive or won't accept help from others when they should. Or they're intelligent in one area but their passion is in another area.
