Test run for stereotypical house characters, do you think the Ravenclaw is too much of a smartass?

Four wizards, one from each house, go shopping together. After some time, they come across a most usual item: A knife enchanted to be so hot, it can cut through bread and toast it at the same time.

The Gryffindor immediately loves it: "Cool! Imagine /stabbing/ someone with that thing!"

The Ravenclaw rolls his eyes at the Gryffindor's reaction, carefully examines the red-hot blade and states: "Judging by the color, it's about seven hundred degrees Celsius. It would immediately cauterize the wound, and stop any bleeding. So it wouldn't be that good as a weapon."

The Slytherin smiles and asks the Ravenclaw: "True. But what if you wanted information?"

The Hufflepuff gives his friends a rather disturbed look, then he looks at the knife for a few seconds and finally asks the question: "Why would you want to /stab/ someone when you could have /toast/?"
