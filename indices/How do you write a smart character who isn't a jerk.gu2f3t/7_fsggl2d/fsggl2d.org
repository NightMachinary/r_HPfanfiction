Make them care about what they know. Have them really passionate in a subject and always wanting to learn more about it. (Put in scenes where they get really excited when they meet someone in a particular proffesion and ask them a bunch of questions etc)

A way to demonstrate this is instead of starting explanations with "fine, I'll dumb it down for you..." start them with "this is so cool..." or "let me tell you about..."
