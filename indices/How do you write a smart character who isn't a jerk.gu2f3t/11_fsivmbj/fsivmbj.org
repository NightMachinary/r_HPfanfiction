I think, firstly, what many fics with "smart" characters fall foul of is that they treat intelligence as though it's the ultimate virtue.

As though, if you're clever, you can get away with being selfish, thoughtless, spiteful, etc. Hands up who ever chose their friends based on cleverness?

There are far more important virtues in people - generosity, patience, charm (not as in the branch of magic!). Someome who's clever isn't immediately admirable or likeable just because of it.

The other feature people tend to use when they get it "wrong", in my view, is they have their clever characters simply (and often inexplicably) be very knowledgable. Clever people usually /are/ knowledgable, but that isn't all there is to it. People certainly aren't born knowledgeable, even if we accept that some people are naturally cleverer than others.

Cleverness that can make a character relatable should involve the character /learning/ information, and they can make clever inferences, ask clever questions, try clever experiments, to get there. That way the reader feels as though they're involved in the learning and can appreciate the efforts made by the character to be "clever".
