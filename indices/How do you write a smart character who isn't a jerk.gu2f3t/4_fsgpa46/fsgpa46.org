This is a rather odd way to give advice, but I'm gonna speak from my own experience. I am rather smart, (get good grades, pretty good at solving problems, etc) and I try to not be an asshole whenever possible. By the accounts of friends and family I mostly succeed. Here are three situations I've encountered in life where it is easy to be an asshole that are specifically related to being a bit smarter than other people.

1: Someone is doing something wrong, and you know how to do it right.

Ans: Unless its actually dangerous for the thing in question to be messed up, dont intervene directly. Offer to help once (only once) and if they say no then let them be and let them do the thing wrong. Chances are the person in question is also smart, (because few people are genuinely stupid) and will figure it out eventually. If they don't figure it out then they will either look up how to do it (if means to do so are available) or ask for help. If someone asks for help, help them but do not talk about their previous failure beyond contrasting the wrong way to do the thing with the right way. Do not do that more than once for any given step in the process unless asked for clarification.

2: Someone asks for a piece of information and you have said information.

Ans: Make the person asking aware that you have said information in a calm, reserved, or gentle manner. Do not begin telling said information unprompted, wait for the person asking to acknowledge that they would like you to answer. Do /not/ explain said information in a condescending fashion, or as if the information is obvious or plain to see.

3: when arguing with someone over something objective.

Ans: While still in the arguement, acknowledge the other persons point of view. When you are proven right, do not mention it or gloat. /When you are proven wrong/, acknowledge your error, and do your best to not repeat whatever it was you were wrong about. Most importantly, don't just admit that you are wrong, (do that) but also /acknowledge that the other person was right/.

In general avoid condescension, and always examine your own behavior to check if you have been acting with a sense of superiority.

I hope that's helpful to you, although there is a good chance it isn't. Above all I really hope I didn't sound like an asshole.
