I wonder, do any fics treat their 'magical core' like a muscle instead of an MP gauge?

Everyone's is about the same strength (unless you have a related disability, like Filch/Figg being Squibs), it gets moderately stronger with exercise (frequent spell use), but strenuous work causes it to tire out and attempting too-strong magic or some curses might tear it?

...And given all the other words that JK Rowling has made up, shouldn't it have a more interesting name than 'magical core'? Like, wizard/witch muscle...Wussel?

...New rule. All magical cores are now to be referred to as 'Wussels'. And anyone showing them off is to be referred to as putting on the wandshow.
