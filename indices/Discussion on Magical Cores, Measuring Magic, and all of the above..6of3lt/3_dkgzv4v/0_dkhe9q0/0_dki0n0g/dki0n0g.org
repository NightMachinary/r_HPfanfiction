Harry raised his eyebrows, "Nuclear Wussels? Okay, I can show you the Wussels."

Then he jumped up on his seat and, in the middle of the Great Hall, ripped off his robes, twisting his body and flexing his arms like he was just about to cast a spell, sparkling energy building up between his fingertips for all to see.

"Mr. Potter," McGonagall demanded, "Now is not the time, put your robes back on this insta-oh, my~â™¥"

As the old transfiguration professor slowly sank back into her seat, her heart all aflutter, Harry continued to spin and twirl, posing and twisting like he was in a massive wizard duel against hundreds of foes.

Across the Hall, Draco Malfoy twitched, before he suddenly stood up and jumped up on the table, "Give it up, Potter, your Wussels are nothing compared to /these/!"

And then the blonde boy flung his arms out like he was facing down a dragon, his body brimming with magic for all to see.

Millicent Bulstrode and Pansy Parkinson squealed in concert, "He's so dreamy!"

Across the Hall again, Hermione snorted, "Really? You two are nothing. Check out /this wandshow/!"

And she stood up, flexing her Wussels, as Cho Chang and Luna Lovegood from Ravenclaw both rose at the same time, and the Hufflepuff table erupted in wolf-whistles as Cedric Diggory rose to the challenge...

And then there was a surge, as everyone got off their seats and started to move, Wussels flexing and wiggling for all to see, from seventh years to excited first-years, and even the teachers were getting into it, McGonagall turning back and forth from her Animagus form...

If an observer walked into the Great Hall at that very moment, they would have seen a very strange (and sexy) sight.

Hundreds of teenage wizards were standing in the Hall, brimming with power, robes discarded, twisting and pointing their fingers at each other like they were engaged in a massive, silent, wandless battle.

If not for the fact that nothing was being transfigured (save for a few students who seemed to showing off their Animagi skills), and no rays of light were shooting across the room, one could mistake it for the greatest magical duel in history.
