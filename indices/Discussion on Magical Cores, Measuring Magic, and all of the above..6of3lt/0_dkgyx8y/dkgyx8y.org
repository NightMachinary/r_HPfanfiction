I prefer magic to be a force. You cast your spell and magic does something. The way it does it should remain mainly mysterious. You don't need energy, mana or something else to power it, all that's needed is magic.\\
When you add something like magical energy to it, you make it similar to physics fundamentally, and I prefer them to be different in nature and separate.\\
Magic should be metaphysically different from the mundane. That's the point. It cannot be supernatural if it's rooted into the natural. It should work in a completely different way than the rest of the universe.

Do I hate magical cores or magic as energy? No. But I strongly prefer the other way.

I feel that magical cores and the like remove the 'magic' from magic.
