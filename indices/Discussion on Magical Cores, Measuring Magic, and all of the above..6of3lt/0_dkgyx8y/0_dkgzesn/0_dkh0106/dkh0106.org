It doesn't really matter since the result would be decorrelated from the amount of magic. If there is no energy, the same magic is used to cast a lumos or an avada kedavra. It's just magic doing something when you cast a spell, the spell can be more or less complex or powerful, but ultimately, it's just magic doing something through mysterious ways.

Then, even if you could quantify magic, it wouldn't give you any useful information apart from the amount of it present somewhere. it just isn't pertinent.
