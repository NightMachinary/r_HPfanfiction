No. A force is only the exerting of an action. It so happens that the amount of work exerted is dependent on the amount of force in the physical world because the physical world works in a certain way. Magic doesn't have to work the same way.

Quantifiable force only means that you are able to know and quantify the amount of force available. That this amount of force is related with the result is true in physics, but it doesn't have to be with magic. And if magic doesn't work with energy or through quantities, the amount of it is irrelevant and of no consequence in the result.

And here you got something that works in a completely different manner than physics.

Obviously, you don't need anything quantifiable in this model, but you keep insisting on introducing it into it.
