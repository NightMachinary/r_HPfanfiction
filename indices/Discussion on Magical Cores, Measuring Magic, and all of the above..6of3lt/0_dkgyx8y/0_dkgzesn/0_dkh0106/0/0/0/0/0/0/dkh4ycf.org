  "look I shoot out hundreds of spells now I feel exhausted".

That implies that you're spending energy to cast spells and thus that magic is powered by energy. It's not a detailed explanation, but it's an explanation nonetheless. The problem is that it explains the way magic works /fundamentally/ and that it makes it look similar to the way physics work. It's less mysterious and exotic than a force that works with a completely different set of rules.

  I also don't see how that's any different than Rowling citing Magical Theory several times as helping people use spells easier, isn't that also explaining it then?

Not necessarily fundamentally. Rowling doesn't explain much what magical theory is. In the magic system I describe, it would be about how /spells/ work as opposed to magic. And about the various laws of magic you have to follow to make your spells work.
