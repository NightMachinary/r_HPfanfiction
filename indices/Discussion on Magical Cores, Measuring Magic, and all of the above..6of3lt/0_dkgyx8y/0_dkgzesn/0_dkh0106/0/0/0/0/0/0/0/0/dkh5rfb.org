You need to learn how to cast your spells, it means there are laws. Otherwise, you'd just have to wish for a result and it would happen. And even then, if you have to wish it for magic to happen, it's still some kind of law.

Also, from canon we know there are laws of magic. For example you can't transfigure or conjure food.

And also, for flavor, I like to see magic as something that have a lot of completely arbitrary and particular laws (some that are true for all magic, or for a field of it, or even for a single spell), discovered by wizards through trial and errors.\\
Again, it makes it even more different than physics, which works completely logically, and whose rules are universal.
