  Accidental Magic. Wild Magic done without incantation or flexing of fingers or wand waving. Already disproven by canon.

Those are exceptions. Some of the laws can be subverted. That's consistent with my model.

Exactly. That's what I'm talking about. Arbitrary laws, no logic fundamentally. In short, different from physics.
