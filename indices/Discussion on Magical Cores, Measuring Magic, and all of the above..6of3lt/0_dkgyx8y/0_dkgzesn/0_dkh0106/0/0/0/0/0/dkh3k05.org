  Making it quantifiable is, however, a way to try to explain it. I should be the one blaming you on that.

No, it's a way of saying, "look I shoot out hundreds of spells now I feel exhausted". Observations are not explanations. I also don't see how that's any different than Rowling citing Magical Theory several times as helping people use spells easier, isn't that also explaining it then?
