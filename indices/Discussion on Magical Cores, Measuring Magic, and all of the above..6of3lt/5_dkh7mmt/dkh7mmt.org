As I see it, magic is like a muscle. If we say that a standard first year with a full core has 100 units, with 0.1 unit recovery in a minute, and that at the end of the year has a core of 110 and 0.15 unit recover/min. This also brings forth the question of where magic comes from. I see at as a form of energy like electricity, heat and movement. The core is like a battery, and it uses your body as a generator, with food, oxygen and water for fuel. There is actually very few fat wizards, something I think comes from the fact that if they use magic daily, a lot of the food they eat is converted into magic.

But, the idea that magic is something mysterious and occult, is also good. It's just that so few manage to pull it off.
