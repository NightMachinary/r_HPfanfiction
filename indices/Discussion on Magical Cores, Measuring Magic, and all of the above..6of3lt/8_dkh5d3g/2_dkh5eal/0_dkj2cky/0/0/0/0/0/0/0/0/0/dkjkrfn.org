  However, your point was that magic behaves like it is powered by energy, by depleting itself when you cast a spell, thus allowing things like magical fatigue or quantifiable magic. And I have argued that it doesn't have to be so to be consistent. Which you deny, because you find it illogical.
#+end_quote

Why does it have to behave like energy for you to be capable of exhausting some of it?

#+begin_quote
  Magic can very well be a specific kind of energy (something like magical energy) or be powered by it and still be able to create energy. It's not the way I like it, but I really don't see why it couldn't.
#+end_quote

Because energy is limited. Magic being energy is frankly boring and annoying.

#+begin_quote
  I argue that magic doesn't have to be. And you're not even addressing the point. I have yet to read a single argument from you against that.
#+end_quote

Magic doesn't have to be what you say it doesn't have to be either. It's pointless going down the rabbit hole of what it can and can't be, that's why I'm telling you what makes for the most interesting variation in fanfiction.

  Again, if magic does, then it behaves fundamentally like physics in this matter. If it doesn't, then it behaves differently. I prefer it to behave differently.
#+end_quote

You're not explaining this in the slightest. How does it behave like Physics if it defies physics? Your logic makes no sense.

#+begin_quote
  When you make magic quantifiable, you make it fundamentally quantifiable, even if the details are not known. It has consequences in all your magic system if it's consistent. Dumbledore is more powerful than Harry in canon because he can achieve greater results with his magic than Harry, not because he has more magic (or can use it longer). If you state that Dumbledore is more powerful than Harry because he has more magic, then you make your magic quantifiable.
#+end_quote

Having more Magic doesn't make you more powerful. Those are two separate things, I would more attribute that to the quality of the Magic rather than the quantity, as well as how sensitive the Wizard is to Magic, how well Magic responds to him, etc... It isn't as cut and dry as "More powerful because more Magic" sure you have more to use but this doesn't account for actual Magical Power or skill.

#+begin_quote
  Well, that's quantifiable magic. That it's not fully defined and explained doesn't change that.
#+end_quote

Yet the story had a better rendition of Magic than Harry Potter IMO.

#+begin_quote
  See? Magic as energy.
#+end_quote

Not really, it doesn't need energy to became exhausted or generated.
