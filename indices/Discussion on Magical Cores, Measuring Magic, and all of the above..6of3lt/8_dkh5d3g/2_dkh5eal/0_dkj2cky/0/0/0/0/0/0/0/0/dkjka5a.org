  TL;DR It's not imposing limits on Magic, it's imposing limits on the Wizard.
#+end_quote

That's exactly my point, that you've been arguing since the beginning of this conversation.\\
To impose limits on wizards, magic needs /rules/, not /logic/.\\
There are other ways to impose limits than making magic quantifiable or making it behaving like energy.

#+begin_quote
  By saying Canon Magic is odd and mysterious and that's the reason you like it, is simply saying that you like bad and inconsistent writing.
#+end_quote

This is a strawman. I haven't been talking about canon magic unless as reference or example.\\
Also, and more importantly, what can make, at times, Harry Potter inconsistent has little to do with its magic system. It has to do with Rowling's writing and plot.

#+begin_quote
  The way I see it is that Magic can create energy and destroy it in a direct fuck you to physics
#+end_quote

That's not what you've been describing, and that's not what you've been arguing against.\\
Magic can create energy out of nothing just as easily as it can create matter out of nothing because ultimately those two things are the same.\\
However, your point was that magic behaves like it is powered by energy, by depleting itself when you cast a spell, thus allowing things like magical fatigue or quantifiable magic. And I have argued that it doesn't have to be so to be consistent. Which you deny, because you find it illogical.\\
Well, consistency isn't about logic, it's about making rules and sticking to it. Those rules don't have to be logic and they don't even necessarily have to be known by the reader to be consistent, they have to be followed by the author, or transgressed in a way that makes sense.

#+begin_quote
  Magic, therefore cannot be energy
#+end_quote

Magic can very well be a specific kind of energy (something like magical energy) or be powered by it and still be able to create energy. It's not the way I like it, but I really don't see why it couldn't.

#+begin_quote
  but there are forces in this world that are quantifiable (Gravity being the main one)
#+end_quote

So? Everything is quantifiable in the universe. I argue that magic doesn't have to be. And you're not even addressing the point. I have yet to read a single argument from you against that.

#+begin_quote
  So there is no reason to think Magic isn't the same.
#+end_quote

Again, if magic does, then it behaves fundamentally like physics in this matter. If it doesn't, then it behaves differently. I prefer it to behave differently.

#+begin_quote
  You mistake me for someone that wants it measured or verifiable defined, but I'm not of that opinion, hence my flair.
#+end_quote

That's not true. When you make magic quantifiable, you make it fundamentally quantifiable, even if the details are not known. It has consequences in all your magic system if it's consistent. Dumbledore is more powerful than Harry in canon because he can achieve greater results with his magic than Harry, not because he has more magic (or can use it longer). If you state that Dumbledore is more powerful than Harry because he has more magic, then you make your magic quantifiable.\\
The dynamic is completely different.

#+begin_quote
  I recommend reading The Magician's series, Magic is never solely defined, but after intense and large battles, the protagonist describes himself as Magically fatigued and unlikely of being capable of producing another spell (should he risk burning up and becoming a Niffin, a creature without humanity or a moral compass, it's made of pure Magic).
#+end_quote

Well, that's quantifiable magic. That it's not fully defined and explained doesn't change that.

#+begin_quote
  I assume this happens because his internally generated Magic cannot be generated faster than he is casting
#+end_quote

See? Magic as energy.
