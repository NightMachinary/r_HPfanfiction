By saying Canon Magic is odd and mysterious and that's the reason you like it, is simply saying that you like bad and inconsistent writing. Let me break down what I think Magic should be, Magic should have no general limitations, but spells and fields of Magic may have limitations. The way I see it is that Magic can create energy and destroy it in a direct fuck you to physics, so Magic is omnipotent in its own right, therefore Food, Gold, etc... are all within the realm of possibility but probably require more power than it's worth. Magic, therefore cannot be energy, but there are forces in this world that are quantifiable (Gravity being the main one), so there is no reason to think Magic isn't the same. You mistake me for someone that wants it measured or verifiable defined, but I'm not of that opinion, hence my flair. I'm just saying that Wizards should have limitations on how much they can use Magic. Whether it's because they risk putting their body in danger, or they have a form of exhaustion that even physically taxes them, or both (Which I personally think should be the rationale). I recommend reading The Magician's series, Magic is never solely defined, but after intense and large battles, the protagonist describes himself as Magically fatigued and unlikely of being capable of producing another spell (should he risk burning up and becoming a Niffin, a creature without humanity or a moral compass, it's made of pure Magic). I assume this happens because his internally generated Magic cannot be generated faster than he is casting, so his body ends up trying to take Magic from the environment, the environment, however, is filled with Wild Magic, it's like putting Salt Water into a fresh Water supply to increase the amount of Water, in short, that Magic isn't used to your body and it ends up storming in with abandon and then the rest is history.

TL;DR It's not imposing limits on Magic, it's imposing limits on the Wizard.
