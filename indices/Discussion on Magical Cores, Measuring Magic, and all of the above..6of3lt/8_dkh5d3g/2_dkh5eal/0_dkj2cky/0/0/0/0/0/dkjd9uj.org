  You're limiting magic by thinking it has to work like other things you know. It doesn't have to.

No, I'm thinking that it works in an obvious way with the context given in the potterverse. Essentially, I'm saying that because we are in a school for Wizards in a place where Wizards are common and not the deus ex machina to save the hero, Magic has to work in consistent and logical (kinda) ways.
