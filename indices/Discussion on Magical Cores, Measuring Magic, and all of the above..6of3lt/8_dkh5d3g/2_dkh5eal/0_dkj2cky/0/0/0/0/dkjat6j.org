You're still guilty of equating magic with physics. An infinite amount of energy in your body would kill you, an infinite (or otherwise unquantifiable) amount of magic in your body /doesn't have to/.\\
You're limiting magic by thinking it has to work like other things you know. It doesn't have to.

Moreover, magic doesn't actually have to be infinite to be unquantifiable.\\
Maybe it actively resists quantification. Or maybe it cannot be observed.\\
If you don't spend magic to cast a spell (if magic just does something and remains unchanged when you cast a spell, even if it can change for other reasons), that simple fact would render quantification either impossible or irrelevant. That is an excellent example of how magic could be finite /and/ internal /and/ unquantifiable /at the same time/, actually. A force that doesn't depletes itself to act.
