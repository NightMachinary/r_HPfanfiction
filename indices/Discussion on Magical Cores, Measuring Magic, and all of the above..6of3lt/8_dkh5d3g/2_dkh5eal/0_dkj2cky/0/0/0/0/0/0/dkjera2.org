No. It has indeed to be consistent. It means that it has to work within the established rules or break them in a well thought out and well-explained way (just as the philosopher stone seemingly breaks the laws of magic because it is a work of alchemy, which is not held under the same laws than the rest of magic or how the horcrux does pretty much the same by splitting the soul, and thus stopping the caster from dying).

Using a deus ex machina to save the hero is a /plot device/ it has nothing to do with the way magic works and very much with the way the author writes their story, and you can very well devise a deus ex machina with a completely logical magic system using quantifiable magic.

The consistency of a magic system has nothing to do with how logic it is. It has to do with the way you write your story and the way you respect or subvert the rules established in your story. For instance, Alice In Wonderland is consistent /and/ illogical.

That you want magic to be logical and quantifiable is a matter of personal preference, and nothing more. It doesn't make more sense in a story, it makes more sense to you.

And something else makes more sense to me. I prefer something that is fundamentally less logical and metaphysically different from the way the rest of the universe works, and you prefer something closer to physics.
