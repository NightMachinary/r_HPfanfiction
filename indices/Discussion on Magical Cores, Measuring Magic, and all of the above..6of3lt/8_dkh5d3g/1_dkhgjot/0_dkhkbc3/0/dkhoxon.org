The thing is that if magical power is quantifiable, then by that logic, Dumbledore would be inferior to two adult wizards. The problem is that we know he is far, far beyond that.

We KNOW that Dumbledore's skill is on a whole different level compared to the average wizard. If the average Auror is about 4 times better than the average wizard, and McGonagall is about 5 better than the average Auror, and McGonagall+Kingsley+Slughorn held their own against a watered down Voldemort... then wouldn't this make Dumbledore at the very least 60 times more "magically powerful" than the average adult wizard. And that's if one downplays Dumbledore to be Voldemort's equal.

If Voldemort was checking for magical power, Dumbledore would be worth like 60+ average adult wizards at the bare minimum and thus Dumbledore wouldn't be able to use the boat. Therefore, there is a difference between this fanon concept of "magical power" and the power of the spells themselves. Fiendfyre itself is equally powerful whether it comes from Crabbe or from Voldemort, but Voldemort has more skill and experience coupled with the capability to control Fiendfyre and thus his magical skill is what makes Voldemort's spell more dangerous than Crabbe's. The same can be said of every spell.

This means that either magic cannot be quantified, or that the quantity itself has no value. But if the quantity of magical power has no value, then it serves no purpose and thus has no effect on anything.

Since if Dumbledore has less magic than two average adult wizards, it doesn't explain how that same Dumbledore could effortlessly handle dozens of Aurors (and Aurors themselves are much more powerful than 2+ average adult wizards) based on the talent he has demonstrated on-page alone. Surely it must mean that either:

- Magical power" is nonexistent (only intelligence, experience, and talent) as per canon, hence why Dumbledore is leagues beyond anyone other than Voldemort or Grindelwald. It reconfirms that Voldemort was only counting the quantity of adult wizards, rather than their quality ("magical power").

- It creates a massive plot hole because it implies that Dumbledore has less magical power than two average adult wizards, and since Dumbledore is the most powerful wizard, it means that everyone else has a "magical power" value less than 1.

Meaning that, as per Voldemort's defences, the average adult wizard has less magical power than the average adult wizard. If McGonagall, Slughorn, and Kingsley all got on Voldemort's boat, their combined "magical power" would be less than Dumbledore's? Meaning that according to whatever standard Voldemort's boat spell works on, the average adult wizard has higher "magical power" than McGonagall, Kingsley, and Shacklebolt.

Yet if McGonagall could beat 4-5 Aurors in a duel (as implied by Madam Pomfrey in OotP), and Aurors are at least 4 times as "magical powerful" as the average wizard (given that its kinda implied the average wizard didn't take their NEWTs, meaning they at best have nine Acceptable OWLs), then the average wizard would be at the very most be worth something like 0.035 compared to Dumbledore's value of 1.

*TL;DR: If Voldemort really was checking for magical power, then it opens a massive plot hole so big that it contradicts the entire canon. Voldemort's boat spell has so many loopholes that it would make the locket the most vulnerable Horcrux if said loopholes were exploited. Magic and "magical power" being quantifiable just contradicts too much of canon to be canon, and arguably raises some unfortunate eugenics-esque implications regarding Voldemort and pure-blood supremacy.*
