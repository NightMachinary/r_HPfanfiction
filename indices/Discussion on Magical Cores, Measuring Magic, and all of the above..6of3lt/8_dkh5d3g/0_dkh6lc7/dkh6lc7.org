But that way doesn't make sense at all. I say that because Voldemort's spell was detecting ADULT wizards. *Even Dumbledore pointed out that "age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth", since Voldemort set the bar by preventing two or more adult wizards from getting on the boat.* Voldemort's spell to detect so-called "magical power" was simply yet another example of Voldemort's arrogance. He failed to acknowledge the possibility that an underage witch or wizard could ever find the boat, therefore he didn't take it into account. Dumbledore basically spells it out.

Voldemort's security is supposed to be flawed in-universe. Dumbledore pointed out that Voldemort made a mistake by overlooking underage wizards. What is commonly considered an example of quantifiable magical power is simply one of Voldemort's many instances of arrogance and/or plot-induced stupidity.

If magic is really quantifiable, then it contradicts canon purely off of Dumbledore skill. If Dumbledore's "magical power" value is only 1 (as per the vaue given by Voldemort's spell), then that means every other witch and wizard is less than 1. Given the gap in skill between Dumbledore and everyone not named Voldemort/Grindelwald, that would mean every other witch and wizard would be worth a 0 based on Voldemort's security system.

Yet as Rowling herself said, you are either a wizard or you aren't. You can't be half a wizard or half-magical. Characters in the HP series are either wizards or they are not wizards. Even if magical power was quantifiable, you can't be 10% magical. Even muggle-borns like Hermione and Lily are witches, just the same as Bellatrix is a witch. Either a character is a wizard or they are incapable of magic at all.
