Dumbledore would have worded it differently if the spell wasn't reacting to magical power. If it was simply age, he would have said so - but he mentioned magical power instead. He specifically mentoned the "amount of magical power", even, and that Harry's "powers will not register" next to his.

That's pretty much quantifying magic.
