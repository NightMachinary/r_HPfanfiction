I personally don't really like quantifiable magic because it's a bit counterproductive to the main plot of the books, because if you can quantify magic than it's just a question of numbercrunching and saying:

"Muggleborns consistently have ( the same amount of / less ) magic than purebloods, thus they (aren't / are) inferior."

So if you're gonna have quantifiable magic you gotta take some special care with the plot because the purist party line will be different.

That said I did like the core system used in the Pureblood Pretense; the author actually word-built it up across the series, across the series magical exhaustion is somewhat rare happening only after brewing some rather advanced potions and stuff of the like.

Harry does have a big +dick+ core but the story does mention big +dick+ core problems and it actually does introduce reasons for why you'd try to quantify it in the first place.

And cores aren't really used as shorthand for "bigger core == better wizard" for your everyday work a normal-ish core seems to do the trick, you just need a bigger core if you're delving into more arcane fields.

I will admit that this seems to be the exception though, most fics I've read that mentioned core don't really have as much work put into the concept.

P.S.: @OP, I totally stole "GOLDEN PATRONUS MEGAZORD" for my flair.
