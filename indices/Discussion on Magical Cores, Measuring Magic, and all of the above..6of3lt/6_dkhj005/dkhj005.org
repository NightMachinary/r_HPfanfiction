Even if there is no magic drain on the self at all, casting a spell still requires thinking, maintaining a constant focus, recalling a number of minute details, and making specific fine movements of the hand, wrist, and arm.

All of these are things that get fatigued with use even for mundane things. So at least you're going to end up with muscle fatigue of the arms (so you won't be able to make movements as quickly or as accurately, and at some point you won't be able to cast at all), and similarly for mental exhaustion. having a magical core just adds another constraint.

I imagine there's a potion for repetitive motion syndromes...
