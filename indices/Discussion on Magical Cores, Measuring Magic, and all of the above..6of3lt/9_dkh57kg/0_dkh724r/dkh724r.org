Well wizards being "engergiser bunnies" is canon. There are no limits to how much magic can be performed. You argue that it doesn't add tension or that it should have consequences, yet as Scrimgeour mentions, "the other side has magic too". It doesn't matter if a wizard can infinitely cast spells if every wizard they ever duel can ALSO cast magic infinitely.

Since all wizards are capable of casting magic without physical or mental consequences, duels will always come down to the more talented wizards winning. For example, Harry can cast magic as much as he wants without tiring yet that doesn't matter if Snape, or Bellatrix, or Voldemort, or whoever can just use magic to defend or reflect Harry's spells without tiring themselves either. If one side can use the Stunning Spell 1,000 times then the other side can just cast the Shield Charm 1,000 times (or just cast the Shield Charm once to block all 1,000 Stunners).

In fanfiction, this means that the tension would revolve around wondering who the more skilled wizard is, assuming both sides are roughly equal in talent. Duels would be decided not by some concept of quantifiable, finite "magical power" (which arguably sounds like something Lucius Malfoy would argue to try justify his pure-blood supremacy) but talent, hardwork and intelligence... just as is the case with canon. The only exceptions are Molly vs Bellatrix or every Harry vs Voldemort encounter, because plot.

The only time wizards being "energiser bunnies" would even remotely matter is in the case of wizards versus any non-magical beings (i.e. muggles and squibs) or to a far lesser extent, magical non-wizards (i.e. goblins or house elves).
