If you can simply keep casting all day long - wand waving isn't exactly that tiring - then that has certain consequences people often don't seem to take into account when writing their stories. Wizards acting like Energiser Bunnies doesn't exactly add tension to a story. It doesn't have to remove tension either, infinite ammo can work in an action movie, but generally a hero getting exhausted during a fight and staying standing thanks to stubborness or willpower while risking everything on that last spell tends to be a more compelling narrative than energiser bunny trying spell after spell until something works or the other guy gets him first.
