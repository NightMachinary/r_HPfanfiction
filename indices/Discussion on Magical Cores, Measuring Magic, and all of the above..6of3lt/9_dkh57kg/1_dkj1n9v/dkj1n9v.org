A fight is not only about casting spells, though. It's a life or death situation and therefore extremely tiring nervously.\\
It also compels you to be constantly, as much as you can, at the top of your game.\\
Ask any great chess player, they'll tell you how tiring a chess game can be, although it involves close to no physical effort.

It can also involve a lot of running and ducking and dodging which is physically tiring, especially in a stressful situation.

Finding yourself in a situation where you must outsmart or out skill your opponent when one tiny error can get you killed while having to pay attention to your environment because an unexpected attack can come from anywhere at any time has to be extremely tiring, even if the spellcasting itself isn't.

What you describe is still completely possible with unlimited spell casting. You just have to be smarter.

Take Worm, for instance. The superhumans there can use their abilities all day long, and the tension is still there, and not lessened in the least, even if pretty much anyone can spam their abilities all day long.
