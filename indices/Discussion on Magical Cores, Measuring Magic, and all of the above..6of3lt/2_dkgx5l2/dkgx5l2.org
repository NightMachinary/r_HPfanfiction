Nothing in canon supports the idea that somebody can "run out" of magic. Magic is never treated like a depletable resource. In the days leading up to the first Triwizard Task, Harry casts the summoning charm hundreds of times in order to master it. He didn't run out of magic. He didn't have to take days off to allow his "mana" to refill.

In canon, magical talent is determined by intelligence, aptitude and effort --- just like any other skill. Neville wasn't a bad student because he had a weak "magical core;" he just lacked confidence and coordination. Hermione wasn't a great witch because she was born powerful, she simply studied longer and harder than the rest of the class combined.

Magic is great because it's /magical/, and /mystical/ and /mysterious/. When you quantify magic you're replacing the whimsy with a videogame mechanic, or shitty anime trope. Harry has no mana bar or magical powerlevel.

I dunno, it's like you're taking away something fun and unique about that setting and replacing it with something boring and cliche.

To make matters worse, most "magical core" stories use it as a shitty plot device. Nine times out of ten, magical cores are an excuse to justify Harry being stronger than everybody else, despite him not having earned that strength in anyway. It's the laziest form of power fantasy, and power fantasies are already the laziest type of fanfiction.

And when the author /doesn't/ give Harry the largest +dick+ "magical core," it's only so that he'll seem like the underdog. After all, why bother creating a threatening and scary villain when you could just reduce everything down to simple, quantifiable numbers? Words are hard, after all.

But to be honest, you can ignore everything I've written above. I don't hate magical cores because they go against my headcanon, or because they fail to meet my lofty literacy standards, or anything like that. I really just hate them because they're always shit. I mean, I didn't even know what a magical core was when I first started reading fanfiction, so how could I have known to avoid them? My hatred of magical cores is something that's been beaten into me by dozens of shitty fanfics. I've never seen them add to the story in a positive way.
