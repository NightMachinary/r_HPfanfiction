I agree with pretty much everything you said.

This whole compulsion about making magic "balanced" and treating it like a videogame mechanic is very strange to me. It seems to show a fundamental misunderstanding about fantasy storytelling. I can't think of any classic fantasy where introducing regularities into magic would make it better, it is always left as a mysterious force. The universe in Harry Potter presupposes a somewhat organized study of magic, but there is a huge field that is left unexplained. Nobody is supposed to know how magic truly ticks, what are its limits. Reducing it to some chemical force is lazy storytelling for writers who want to "fix" the series, usually with a painful pop-science theme. It never goes well.

A similar complaint goes for any fic where Harry goes on a hardcore training regime, and we are treated to the fiction version of a gym montage. The idea is that Harry never becomes a super powerful wizard in the books and needs to grind for a bunch of level-ups until he cah take on Voldemort. There are many indy!Harry fics that go like this, Again, this shows bad storytelling. Does the story profit from having Harry do this? Character progression needs to be an organic part of the narrative, not a videogame balancing act.
