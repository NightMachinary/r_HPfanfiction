Honest question. By this logic, is Dumbledore special? Or could anyone be as powerful as Dumbledore?

I've never liked the idea of Magic Cores as a "mana pool" that could be drained. But I do like the idea that magic is in your genes, and just like some people are taller than others, some people are inherently more powerful than others. But I also think that hard work and studying and stuff plays a big role. Kinda like muscle strength. I'm a 5' skinny mini. My husband is 6'4" and build like a line backer. I could go to the gym every day, and I'll never be able to bench press more than him. But if I worked out it, I could absolutely bench press more than most of the people my size. And maybe I can't lift more weights than my husband, but I could outrun him (like having altitudes for different branches or magic). I also believe that any "magical exhaustion" wouldn't be a matter of not having magic to cast a spell, but just being so tired that your spellwork might be sloppy or weak. Like how your legs tremble and ache when you run too far.
