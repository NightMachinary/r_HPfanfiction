  Quite the opposite. If I know I have more power than my opponent, my best tactic to win is to take skill out of the equation and just throw all my power at them from the start.

But your opponent can be Magically Inferior and still defeat you. Just because a Strong Man lifts thousands of pounds and can punch holes in a brick wall, doesn't mean he can beat a practised MMA fighter. But I don't understand how this doesn't stop it from happening with unquantifiable Magic if you think it's true. People are more innately powerful than others in the Potterverse already.

Once again, you can be better at Magic and still be inferior in Capacity and still come out with a Win. Someone being capable of shooting a bunch of third year stunning spells off won't beat someone who has shields built to withstand incredibly powerful Battle-Magic, and then, in turn, won't be able to beat him if he is apparating all over the place and shooting spells out as well.
