  If Dumbledore had a quantifiable amount of power he'd be worth two near squibs at least and yet they'd still be wizards and Dumbledore explicitly states only one wizard at a time.

No, Dumbledore's a Wizard because he's a Wizard. This makes sense because Crouch Jr also said that there was a significant difference between someone in Harry's year and him in terms of if they can cast a Killing Curse. So it's probably because Harry lacks something Magically to make him a full Wizard or he lacks something mentally. Dumbledore is a Wizard because he is a Wizard, he has that something, Voldemort didn't account for that something so Harry was an independent variable.
