I can hold my hand up to the light of the sun and make shapes like a wizard uses magic to shape the world. The hands are mine but neither my hands nor the light of the sun are going to be worn out by me making shadows. I'm definitely in control of the shapes I make. Nothing here is used or limited. I could, if I wanted, turn and stare into the sun without shielding my eyes if hated myself so I wanted to blind myself.
