  But your opponent can be Magically Inferior and still defeat you. Just because a Strong Man lifts thousands of pounds and can punch holes in a brick wall, doesn't mean he can beat a practised MMA fighter

Except this doesn't really make sense. In the quantity scenario, no matter the quality of my opponent's magic, I can wear them down, because they have to use up a unit of magic to counter each unit of my magic. If I cast a spell with power 5 and they cast a shield with power 5 to counter it, and I have total 100 power and they have total 90 power, my best bet is to just keep forcing them to cast shield with power 5 until they have no power and I have 10.

Indeed, quality is if anything a handicap in this situation. You mention, for example, "shields built to withstand incredibly powerful battle magic" but actually increasing the quality of my spells (and thus their power) is just going to make me tire faster. The most efficient way of conserving my strength is to cast a shield that only just blocks their spell. Either way, I'm going to run out of power to fuel my shields before they run out of power to fuel their attacks. Whether I channel all my fuel into a single high quality shield which will repel several of their attacks in a row before breaking, or whether I conserve my power by casting a succession of weak shields which block one spell before breaking each... it doesn't help me either way. I only have so much magic to counter their attacks, and am going to run out before they do.

  But I don't understand how this doesn't stop it from happening with unquantifiable Magic if you think it's true.

Because in the unquantifiable situation, if I can cast a spell with power 5 and they can cast a shield with power 5, I will never win by just hitting them with the same spell again and again. I can only win if I change to a spell with power 6 - which depends on my general ability with magic, as if I have studied hard I am more likely to be able to cast more powerful spells - or if I put them into a position where they cannot cast their shield.
