  No it doesn't. In Books and most canon sources, it is described as a Jet of Flame that comes out of your wand

  "Incendio!" said Mr Weasley, pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind him. Flames rose at once in the fireplace, crackling merrily as though they had been burning for hours

From GoF.

  it's also a form of Conjuration

No definite confirmation from truly canon source, but everytime it appears it is categorised as a charm.

  Transfiguration Spells do not, you are correct. But that is a single branch of Magic.

That's half of spellcasting though.

  I'm saying that Magic is a force entierly of its own
#+end_quote

And that's very physics-like. Well and terribly simplistic. You see magic as some weird force that does weird things. And I would say that it's different, that magic is a part, a layer of the reality. JKR wrote:

  I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override 'mundane' nature, but not 'magical' nature.
#+end_quote

So there is a magical nature that's separate from mundane nature. It's not one force, just like mundane nature doesn't have one force. Thus I don't think that wizards create anything, conduct anything, etc.

Knowledge is power. See:

  An' anyway, yeh couldn' work any of them curses yet, yeh'll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.
#+end_quote

Right understanding of reality is power. See transfiguring things with similar name.

Feelings and emotions are power. See love or Tonk's depression affecting her abilities.

Human acts have power. See sacrifice of Lily.

If emotions, knowledge, acts that are non-magical in their intention are all actually magical, then it means that magic is not some force that you can shoot from yourself.
