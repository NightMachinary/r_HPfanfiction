Okay lets find another quote for you

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort will not have cared about weight but the amount of magical power... SO ONLY ONE WIZARD at a time.
#+end_quote

If we say a wizard is a magical being, a being is definitely quantifiable, then we say that an underage wizard isn't seen as a full wizard then this makes sense. If Dumbledore had a quantifiable amount of power he'd be worth two near squibs at least and yet they'd still be wizards and Dumbledore explicitly states only one wizard at a time.
