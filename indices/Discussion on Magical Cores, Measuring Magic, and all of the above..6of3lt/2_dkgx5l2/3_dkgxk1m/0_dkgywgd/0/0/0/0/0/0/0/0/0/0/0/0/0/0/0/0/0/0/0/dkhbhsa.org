Probably not, seeing as how they can actively push it inside themselves to become an Obscurial. If Magic is internal, and Wizards generate it, which they likely do (though that's not all they're limited to, I'm not saying that) then when they cast a spell they use up what's in their body, so it either regenerates at a faster rate than they can cast or we are just not informed about Magical Exhaustion. I imagine it isn't a common problem in the Wizarding World considering the classes Harry takes probably account for that so students don't accidentally overdo it (hence why they learn such a small amount of spells in the beginning).
