This exact argument was brought up in the other thread that Taure linked.

To me that sounds a lot more like it measures age. Harry isn't of age in the magical world, he still carries the trace. There are so many potential ways that Voldemort could have limited the number of wizards on the boat. Maybe another enchantment overrides the trace rather than the trace fading and Voldemort searched for that.
