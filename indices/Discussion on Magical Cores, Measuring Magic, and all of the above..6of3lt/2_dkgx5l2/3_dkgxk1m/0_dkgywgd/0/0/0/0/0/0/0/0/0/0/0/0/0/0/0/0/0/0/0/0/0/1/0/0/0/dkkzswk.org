  But telekinesis doesn't come out.

Levitation through Charms is telekinetic exertion of Magic.

No it doesn't. In Books and most canon sources, it is described as a Jet of Flame that comes out of your wand, it's also a form of Conjuration, meaning it creates something from nothing.

  transfiguration spells don't have any jets of light or anything similar mentioned.
#+end_quote

Transfiguration Spells do not, you are correct. But that is a single branch of Magic.

#+begin_quote
  You assume magic to be physics-like, when it's clearly not. It operates on concepts, ideas. Like names, secrets, feeligs. Analogy to physics will be wrong in 90% cases because magic almost nothing like it.

Never said it was like Physics at all, I don't assume it to be such and I don't believe it to be such. I'm saying that he is exerting Magic like a muscle, muscles cannot be overused for you get exhausted or sometimes you can rip it (in this case Magic overflows your body and kills you or worse). I'm saying that Magic is a force entierly of its own, but Wizards have the unique characteristic of being able to independently create it, and control it (even the Magic they don't create, as shown when Dumbledore took control of Voldemort's fire in the Ministry and visa versa).
