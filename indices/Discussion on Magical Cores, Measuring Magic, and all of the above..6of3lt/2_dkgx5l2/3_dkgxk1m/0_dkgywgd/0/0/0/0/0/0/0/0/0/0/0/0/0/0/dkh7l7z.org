...Reread what you just wrote. Think about it for a moment. I have said all along that Harry lacked something, being of age, the thing that stops him being counted as a real wizard. A boy to a man if you will. I have said a wizard is a wizard and that they aren't being measure by the amount of magic. You start with 'No' then agree with everything I said.
