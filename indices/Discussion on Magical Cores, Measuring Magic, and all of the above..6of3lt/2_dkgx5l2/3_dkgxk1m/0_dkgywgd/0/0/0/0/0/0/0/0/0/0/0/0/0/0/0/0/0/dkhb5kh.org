  Think of Trump, he's possibly the most powerful man on earth but you don't say he has 10gigawatts of power. You just know he holds the ability to influence the world around him. You'd know if Putin stepped into the room there'd be even more power that could be wielded but you don't measure it you'd say there are two powerful men in the room. If Trump brought an aide in with him you don't care, there are still two powerful people because the aide hasn't become a world leader. If Voldemort's boat measures like this then Harry being of age makes him like the aide and Dumbledore like Trump. The power certainly exists but you can't explain what it is nor could you measure it in any way you just know it is a real concept.

Sounds like a whole lot of Headcanon and theory, nor do you have any proof that what Dumbledore was saying something cryptic on purpose, Dumbledore said it had a Magical Power limit because he would be the only one in turn capable of getting across the water. He did not account for someone like Dumbledore (Regulus I believe used Kreacher to apparate him there) who equals him in terms of innate power, Dumbledore says 'so only one Wizard' because in the case of supplementing Voldemorts power you could use two wizards or multiple Wizards combined on said boat. But I'll give it to you simply because Magic is an incredibly abstract concept. This still doesn't disprove that Magic is internal, with my example from Fantastic Beasts. And if it's internal and you cast, you lose that portion of Magic inside yourself, the only explanation is that it regenerates and the Wizard creates more, kind of like Insulin when you consume a lot of sugar. This is why I like The Magician's rendition of "A Wizard can overheat and turn into a creature of pure Magic".
