  From GoF.

In contradiction to Harry using it against the Locket Nonverbally and it being described as a Jet of Flame.

  No definite confirmation from truly canon source, but everytime it appears it is categorised as a charm.
#+end_quote

Then let''s use something that is definitely canon, Agumenti. Creates Water from nothing.

  So there is a magical nature that's separate from mundane nature. It's not one force, just like mundane nature doesn't have one force. Thus I don't think that wizards create anything, conduct anything, etc.

But Rowling is known to have no idea of the science or math behind anything. She said this quote about Magical Illness, which essentially means, "Hey, I need a plot device that I'm going to ignore when you think about the fact that you're using Magic to override the grip a Wizard has on his wand, there's also the fact that transfiguration can lead to the creation of a permanent magical creature". Magic as far as we've seen can manipulate its own nature as well as mundane nature.

  Knowledge is power. See: An' anyway, yeh couldn' work any of them curses yet, yeh'll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.
#+end_quote

Well studying also means getting a grip on Magic and learning to control it well. It doesn't automatically equate to knowledge itself being the source of power, but knowledge being something that facilitates the growth of power.

You're also quoting something that himself admitted he didn't get past his own fourth year.

Then lets get to Dumbledore who can 'feel' residual Magic, and said that 'Magic always leaves traces' like an energy of some sort.

  Right understanding of reality is power. See transfiguring things with similar name.
#+end_quote

Not really, you can Transfigure things without understanding how the matter is rearranged. See, Hagrid.

#+begin_quote
  Feelings and emotions are power. See love or Tonk's depression affecting her abilities.
#+end_quote

So lack of concentration with emotions like sadness disrupt something you have to have concentration to do? Who would thunk it? Then Anger makes you even more concentrated on the object of your hatred, which if anything increases concentration, hence unforgivables.

#+begin_quote
  Human acts have power. See sacrifice of Lily.
#+end_quote

Or it was ritualistic in nature, which is Magic we've already seen and know of. Get all the pieces together and it makes something happen.

#+begin_quote
  magic is not some force that you can shoot from yourself.
#+end_quote

Actually, none of that means any of that. Magic doesn't apply by Muggle rationalism, so therefore you can't say it does or doesn't do anything.
