  Consistency, it's a literary element that some people would call vital.

Its almost like if you started a story without it then the story would consistently not have it. If you have adequately shown that hard work and effort yield rewards then you don't need numbers involved at all.

Harry Potter magic is whimsical and free. If you read series like Trudi Canavan's Magicians' Guild trilogy then you'd see that quantified magic with cores limits magic. It also shows people with more power beating down on multiple weak opponents, the combat is basically pre-decided by who has more power, the way this makes the series work is enlarging your core is considered dark magic and the series focuses on whether its okay to do a bad thing for a good reason. It /has/ to focus on that because the magic has to take a back seat. Magic can't be used liberally, it has to be valued the world isn't nearly as amazing or fantastic as the Harry Potter world, their magic is limited.

The question you need to ask is what is the point of limiting magic? This is because if quantifying it isn't limiting it then its a cheap way to overpower characters. You make your favourite characters strong and your least favourite weak. What do you gain? If the limit isn't reachable, i.e. it doesn't interfere with normal life then its not doing anything and therefore what is the point? If it is then magic becomes a scare resource. There is also the problems with making up a system and sticking with it. Is a transfiguration worth ten units of magic, a conjuration thirty? does a matchstick to needle take less than a desk to a pig transformation? Dumbledore likes to conjure chairs, does he become easily deflatable by Crabbe or Goyle if he has to go to too many meetings and creates too many chairs? Its an information heavy thing that takes away from the story telling without adding anything. Fatigue can be a real thing, injuries can be a real thing, mistakes can be real, surprise can be real, there are so many ways to have a character struggle why do you need numbers?

Something else is magic is fundamentally illogical, it can do things that make no sense. Numbers and maths are almost pure logic, if magic was logical wizards would be too. You're dragging down the mystical and the special to something mundane by trying to quantify it.
