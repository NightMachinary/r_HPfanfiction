But Magic is most definitely internal in canon. We see that when being an Obscurial is said to be when someone 'pushes' away their Magic. Also, Accidental Magic exists. This means that Magic is internalised, taking a step forward for the sake of your story and not making everything a Magical Slug Fest with no variety is the better option. Canon noticed Magic, but it did not explore it, heck, we don't even know what it feels like to cast a spell.
