But that makes no sense, in the slightest. The analogy only works if the Wizard doesn't use something in spells, but he does, he creates fire then the fire goes out, what happens to the Magic used to create the flame? It disperses into everything else, the air, the wind, the trees, a cycle, but not into the Wizard, because the Wizard has already created a new portion of Magic to fill the void that was in him. But when a Wizard uses so much that he can't possibly create faster, what naturally happens? The Magic around him attempts to fill the void, but the Magic around him is wild, it has no real limit on how much it wants to go in, it can go over his natural capacity and destroy him. I think that's more consistent and easier to deal with than simply saying a Wizard channels Magic, as that's boring and inconsistent from what canon shows us.
