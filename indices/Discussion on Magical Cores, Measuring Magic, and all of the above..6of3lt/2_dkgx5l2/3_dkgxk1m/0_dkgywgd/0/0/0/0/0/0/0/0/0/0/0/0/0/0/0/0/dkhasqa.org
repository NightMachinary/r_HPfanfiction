It reads the presence of magical power, as a wizard. A wizard is a wielder of the mystical power called magic. The boat measures the number of wizards who are over 17 in it. You're obsessing over a single sentence that is open to interpretation when I have two more that contradict what you. Magical power exists, it doesn't have to be quantified for it to exist.

Think of Trump, he's possibly the most powerful man on earth but you don't say he has 10gigawatts of power. You just know he holds the ability to influence the world around him. You'd know if Putin stepped into the room there'd be even more power that could be wielded but you don't measure it you'd say there are two powerful men in the room. If Trump brought an aide in with him you don't care, there are still two powerful people because the aide hasn't become a world leader. If Voldemort's boat measures like this then Harry being of age makes him like the aide and Dumbledore like Trump. The power certainly exists but you can't explain what it is nor could you measure it in any way you just know it is a real concept.
