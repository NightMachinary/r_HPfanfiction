  And in a world of unquantifiable Magic, you overpower the other duellist by simply having a bigger arsenal than them. It isn't thinking smart, it's conveniently having a spell for the situation like Hermione.

As things should be. Subject to luck and circumstance, the person who is better at magic should win the duel. Having put years of study into magic so that you are able to use more advanced spells is key to that.

  It just happens in a more nuanced way, it makes it so that you don't simply just start off spamming gigantic titanic spells, there's more foreplay to the duel, you have to think smart and you have to conserve your energy and power.

Quite the opposite. If I know I have more power than my opponent, my best tactic to win is to take skill out of the equation and just throw all my power at them from the start. That way they have to use all their power to counter my attacks, and then when they run out of power (or the strain on them becomes too much, or however you want to put it), I'm the only one left standing with the ability to cast spells. Their skill doesn't matter if they have no juice left.

And if I know my opponent has more power than me, then they'll just use that tactic against me.

With quality as opposed to quantity as the deciding factor, I am giving my best for the entire duration of the duel, and the winner is decided by who a) is better at magic, where skill is unequal and b) who uses what they know better, where skill is equal.
