  In a world with quantifiable magical power, casting "bigger" mega-spells is a viable tactic, as you can simply overpower your opponent due to having a larger quantity of magic to them.

And in a world of unquantifiable Magic, you overpower the other duellist by simply having a bigger arsenal than them. It isn't thinking smart, it's conveniently having a spell for the situation like Hermione.

  In a world without quantifiable magic, you have to be clever about dueling, because spamming the same tactic again and again will just fail again and again.
#+end_quote

The same can happen with quantifiable Magic, quite easily. It just happens in a more nuanced way, it makes it so that you don't simply just start off spamming gigantic titanic spells, there's more foreplay to the duel, you have to think smart and you have to conserve your energy and power. I'm not saying Wizards can't take in ambient Magic for spells, or that they don't, I'm saying that there are consequences to too much Magic in your system and too little.

  In a world without quantifiable magic, you have to be clever about dueling, because spamming the same tactic again and again will just fail again and again. If it failed the first time, it will fail all the subsequent times too. It's about the quality of your magic, not its quantity.

Quite the opposite, it's about utilising several different spells to one up your opponent as they don't know those spells and can't sufficiently come up with an anti-magic for them in time. Unquantifiable Magic is all about quantity over quality, that's the whole reason Hermione has such a big strap-on on throughout the entire series, she has a large arsenal.

  - see Dumbledore vs Voldemort in OotP.
#+end_quote

The Dumbledore V Voldemort Duel is a perfect example of what I just said. Remember when Dumbledore threw out the forceful spell and Voldemort put up a shield and it simply splashed along it with a gong like noise?

  The only time "blasting through defences" is a viable tactic with unquantifiable magic is where there exists a significant disparity in magical ability.

How is that not also true for a person with finite Magic, or at least, finite enough so that it takes a couple moments before you feel up to another round of spells? I'm not talking video game mana, where you use it then that's it, as that's too much like humans and ATP, whereas Magic is more of a force than energy. I'm just saying that Wizards should also feel the strain from powerful Magic. There's also the fact that there is an objectively powerful Curse known as Avada Kedavra, that kills in one hit, that can be used no matter what and there's no real getting around it unless you use actual physical energy to dodge or summon physical items to place in front of the spell in time. With infinite Magic you get a situation where meeting an impenetrable defence or an ultimate offence, is impossible to get around.
