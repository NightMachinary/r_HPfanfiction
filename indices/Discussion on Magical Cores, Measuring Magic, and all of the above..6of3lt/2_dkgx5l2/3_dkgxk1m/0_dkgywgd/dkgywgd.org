  As opposed to "Harry threw a Stunner at Voldemort's shield, Voldemort threw an Avada Kedavra, Voldemort sneered at Harry as Harry dodged the spell. Harry threw a piercing hex, then a ripping curse at his target, but they all splashed against a shield. Voldemort cackles. Harry gets FUCKING PISSED AND HE SCREAMS EXPECTO PATRONUM AND SUMMONS HIS GOLDEN PATRONUS MEGA ZORD. Voldemort dies in a blast of fire and brimstone so powerful that the Elder Wand shattered."

This is surely the wrong way around.

In a world with quantifiable magical power, casting "bigger" mega-spells is a viable tactic, as you can simply overpower your opponent due to having a larger quantity of magic to them.

In a world without quantifiable magic, you have to be clever about dueling, because spamming the same tactic again and again will just fail again and again. If it failed the first time, it will fail all the subsequent times too. It's about the quality of your magic, not its quantity. The thing about unquantifiable magic is that /both sides have it/. It doesn't give the attacker an advantage because the defender also cannot run out of magic to use in defence. So winning a duel becomes about getting /around/ the opponent's defence, not blasting through it - see Dumbledore vs Voldemort in OotP.

The only time "blasting through defences" is a viable tactic with unquantifiable magic is where there exists a significant disparity in magical ability.
