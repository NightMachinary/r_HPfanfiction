  Nothing in canon supports the idea that somebody can "run out" of magic.
#+end_quote

Nothing in canon supports many ideas that we assume to be true. Showers in Dorms weren't mentioned, does that automatically mean that no one in Hogwarts bathes other than Prefects?

  In the days leading up to the first Triwizard Task, Harry casts the summoning charm hundreds of times in order to master it. He didn't run out of magic. He didn't have to take days off to allow his "mana" to refill.

Don't need days off to 'refill' mana. Nor is that what I'm implying, I'm just saying that adding tension to a battle through artificial asspulls isn't better than simply saying, "He was growing weary as the spells continued shuttering through his wand with immense speed and power, he had weaved thunder and lightning, shattering them against Voldemort's constructs, he could not continue this for long, should he risk his own Magic overcoming him".

As opposed to "Harry threw a Stunner at Voldemort's shield, Voldemort threw an Avada Kedavra, Voldemort sneered at Harry as Harry dodged the spell. Harry threw a piercing hex, then a ripping curse at his target, but they all splashed against a shield. Voldemort cackles. Harry gets FUCKING PISSED AND HE SCREAMS EXPECTO PATRONUM AND SUMMONS HIS GOLDEN PATRONUS MEGA ZORD. Voldemort dies in a blast of fire and brimstone so powerful that the Elder Wand shattered."

  Magic is great because it's magical, and mystical and mysterious. When you quantify magic you're replacing the whimsy with a videogame mechanic, or shitty anime trope. Harry has no mana bar or magical powerlevel.

Eh, getting tired after casting a shit ton of spells doesn't seem to take any Magic away, it, in fact, adds it, it adds a sense of impending danger, how does Harry escape this? How does he deal with Voldemort in the graveyard when he has already used so many spells within the maze? I can list off several stories that had no quantifiable Magic, yet still somehow managed to be boring. It's because the wonder of Magic is Magic itself, not the person using it.

  After all, why bother creating a threatening and scary villain when you could just reduce everything down to simple, quantifiable numbers? Words are hard, after all.

Harry Potter and The Untitled Tome did it well, amazing even. Measuring someone's innate power is something I admit that I don't even like, but somehow Untitled Tome presented it in a good and fascinating way.

  I really just hate them because they're always shit. I mean, I didn't even know what a magical core was when I first started reading fanfiction, so how could I have know to avoid them? My hatred of magical cores is something that's been beaten into me by dozens of shitty fanfics. I've never seen them add to the story in a positive way.

I suppose that's fair enough.
