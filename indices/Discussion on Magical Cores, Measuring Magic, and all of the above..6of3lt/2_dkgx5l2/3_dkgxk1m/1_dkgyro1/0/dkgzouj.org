  You don't need quantifiable magic to raise the tension. You could have the characters become injured, like in the Department of Mysteries battle.
#+end_quote

The problem with the department of mysteries is that the characters got injured from their own stupidity moreso than anything else. Reliance on ass pulls is something that should be ignored as much as possible.

  You don't need magical cores for a fight to be tense.

Nor am I saying anything about Cores.

  We can assume that the students have access to showers because the students aren't described as filthy and smelly.
#+end_quote

Rowling doesn't describe them as squeaky clean either.

#+begin_quote
  We can assume magic isn't a limited resource because the students never have any concerns over the quantity of spells they cast and the effect that would have on their magical reserves.
#+end_quote

We only have Harry's limited perspective on that. Is Lavender Brown lamenting about how tired she is from that super-hard charm Flitwick made them do more important than allowing Harry to read Sirius' letter? Probably not.

Not saying it's limited. In fact, I'm saying quite the opposite, seeing as how Wizards create their own Magic in this case.

  Surely, if magic could be depleted, it would have become relevant at least once in the course of 7 books? No wizard ever reconsidered casting a spell in order to save their strength. Harry never once thought "perhaps I shouldn't waste my magic now; I might need it later."

Can't say, we get a very tiny amount of internal dialogue ever from Harry.
