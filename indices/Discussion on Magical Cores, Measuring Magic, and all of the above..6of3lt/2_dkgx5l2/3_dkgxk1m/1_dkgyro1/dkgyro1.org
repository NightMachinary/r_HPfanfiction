  Eh, getting tired after casting a shit ton of spells doesn't seem to take any Magic away, it, in fact, adds it, it adds a sense of impending danger, how does Harry escape this? How does he deal with Voldemort in the graveyard when he has already used so many spells within the maze?

You don't need quantifiable magic to raise the tension. You could have the characters become injured, like in the Department of Mysteries battle. Or you could have a ticking clock element, like with the polyjuice in the second Ministry raid. Or you could have the protagonist be hopelessly outclassed, or increasingly outnumbered, or introduce new elements and twists to a fight that constantly raise the suspense. You don't need magical cores for a fight to be tense.

  Nothing in canon supports many ideas that we assume to be true. Showers in Dorms weren't mentioned, does that automatically mean that no one in Hogwarts bathes other than Prefects?

We can assume that the students have access to showers because the students aren't described as filthy and smelly. We can assume magic isn't a limited resource because the students never have any concerns over the quantity of spells they cast and the effect that would have on their magical reserves. Surely, if magic could be depleted, it would have become relevant at least once in the course of 7 books? No wizard ever reconsidered casting a spell in order to save their strength. Harry never once thought "perhaps I shouldn't waste my magic now; I might need it later."
