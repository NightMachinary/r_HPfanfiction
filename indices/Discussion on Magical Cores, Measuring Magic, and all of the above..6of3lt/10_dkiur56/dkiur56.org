Personally I do believe that there must be some kind of limit to storing magical energy, because that makes the most scientific sense. I am fully aware of how fictional and hypothetical this all is, but you can't create a chair from nothing. You would need a very large amount of energy to generate the mass, either from within the caster or the world around them. I consider a combination of these to be true, that wizards must passively re-charge their magic from their surroundings while they rest and eat. It just makes the most logical sense.

Now, that would affect a person's stamina in spell casting, and although some people are born with a slightly greater capacity for magic energy than others, I should imagine that you can increase your capacity. Just as physical stamina can be improved, and like how the stomach will gradually stretch to a larger capacity as you have larger meals, you can improve your magical capacity by using a lot of energy at once on a regular basis, although not too much or you'll be exhausted. But realistically, people don't tend to use that much energy and so very rarely hit their limit. It would take a lot of intensive training to significantly improve your maximum capacity.

However, this doesn't affect a character's strength, only how long they can continuously cast a spell which is unlikely to ever come into play. Spells tend to take up a fixed amount of energy, and its strength from there depends on the caster's mental state, and how accustomed to the spell they and their wand are. Powerful emotions, like love as we know, create powerful magic, and wands are also known to "learn" magic from their owner.

But in most stories, this isn't really necessary to come into play. And even if a character does come close to exhaustion, you can just say they're tired which can be explained in other ways, e.g. they haven't slept or eaten in a long time (which is effectively more or less the same thing) so prejudice against this system can be avoided.
