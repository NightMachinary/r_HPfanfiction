To me, canon implies that on top of knowledge/skill/practice, most spells require sustaining a certain level of mental focus and emotional intent. So while that doesn't mean you use up some quantifiable number of "magic points" like a video game or whatever, at the same time you can't just mindlessly rapid-fire powerful spells machine gun style. I'd also imagine it would be difficult to cast spells on opposite ends of the emotional spectrum (patronus and cruciatus as an extreme example) back to back without taking a break. It's not about "recharging" in either of those cases, but there are just certain limitations to human concentration that you have to be realistic about. Doing mentally strenuous or emotionally draining things causes mental fatigue in real life, and that limits performance. Magic should be no exception right?
