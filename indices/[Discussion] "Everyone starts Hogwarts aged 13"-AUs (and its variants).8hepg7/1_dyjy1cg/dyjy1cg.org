Most authors in fanfiction /cannot/ write children well. They either are:

- *Too serious* - Thinking in adult manners. Almost every fanfic involving "pureblood tradition/families" hits this one.
- *Too horny* - Children at 11 years old still think the other sex have cooties.
- *Too logical* - Even smart children are not capable of plotting out serious plots. "I'm going to invite my rival to the trophy room for a duel and then not show up" is about the extent of 11 year old plotting.
- *Too rebellious* - Young kids tend to be trusting of adults. They don't tend to think they "know better" until their teenage years.

Thankfully, most authors also don't have a plot that requires the characters to be young children.

If an author wants to fudge some dates forward/backwards in order to not have to write children I won't fault them. I personally think it's a decent workaround. It sure beats reading about 11 year old Harry getting a boner thinking about /insert girl/. Or 11 year old Harry immediately thinking Dumbledore is stupid and seeing the correct way to train/kill Voldemort.

Another workaround is simply to pick up Hogwarts after the 3rd or 4th year. However this is not so workable if you put people in different houses. If you want to explore Harry in Hufflepuff with Hermione in Slytherin and Ron in Ravenclaw... you kinda have to have the sorting hat scene.

The stations of cannon in book 1 works well with 13 year olds as well as 11 year olds. But doing it with 13 year olds gives you the ability to have serious/horny/logical/rebel children and have it not be so out of place.

It is really easy to fudge dates to make it work. Shift everything and everyone backwards 2 years per generation. Rowling does not use concrete dates in her plots with the exception of Grindelwald (done to match WW2). And that one is far enough back that an added 4 to 6 years to the remaining cast does not matter. ^{[1]}

Also change the age of wizarding majority from 17 to 19... or even 18.^{[2]}

[1] Dumbledore and Grindelwald are "old" enough that fudging 4-6 years does not impact plot at all.

[2] This fixes the Triwizard plot (assuming you are still on canon rails).
