The way I look at it, fanfic is to canon as canon is to real life.

In "original" fiction like the HP novels, realism and verisimilitude are evaluated relative to real life. In [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/earthfic.shtml]["earthfic"]] in particular, we expect the story to be something that /could happen/ in reality as we know it. In sci-fi or fantasy, we expect internal consistency, and for the elements that could not be found in reality as we know it (like magic wands) to be justified --- to contribute to the story.

In fanfic, realism and verisimilitude are evaluated relative to canon. Therefore, deviations from canon setting and characters are a bit like "unrealistic" elements in "original" fiction: they need to be justified, either in that they contribute the story or in that they are necessary for internal consistency with deviations that do.

Another way to look at it is that a story has a Suspension of Disbelief Budget, and every inconsistency, internal or external, spends from that budget. In "original" fiction, external consistency is relative to real life, but in fanfic, it's relative to the canon. (If one change logically implies others, there is no double-spending, however.)

For example, a canon Gryffindor being sorted into Slytherin costs relatively little, unless their character traits and values are profoundly inconsistent with Slytherin (e.g., Luna). However, the same fic introducing a Manipulative!Dumbledore or Nice!Accepting!Slytherins or BloodPurist!Bully!Gryffindors as fics like that often do are very expensive, and do have a cost, because the first divergence does not imply others.
