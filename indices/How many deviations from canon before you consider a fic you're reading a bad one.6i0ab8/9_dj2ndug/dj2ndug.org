A story that is 100% canon-compliant is... canon. If you want that, just re-read the original books. The only exceptions to that are stories that canon doesn't cover, such as Marauder-era and nextgen stories - and even those have some canon attributes to uphold.

If you'll excuse me, I'll use one of my own stories as an example : linkffn(Harry Potter the Muggle). That story essentially reverses canon but couldn't exist without Harry Potter canon - mirror images don't exist without the original.

Having said all this, I know where you're coming from. But I don't think it's about how much a story changes, it's about whether it changes things in a way the reader doesn't like that's important. If you don't like the changes, stop reading.
