A story about Magnus Dreiblatt, a young ravenclaw pureblood going to hogwarts, watching the events unfold around harry potter, his own slightly bigoted views being slowly changed by those events, even if they exactly follow canon, isn't the same thing as just rereading the books unless the author is just doing a lame SI.
