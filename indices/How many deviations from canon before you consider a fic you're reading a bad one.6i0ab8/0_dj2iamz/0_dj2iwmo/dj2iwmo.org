I think my issue is that you've changed one, two, maybe three elements, How much more can you pile in to the story before it's no longer fanfiction but an "original" story that just uses elements from something else?

Edit: And the use of fanon elements that are so overused just screams a lack of imagination to me or a lack of critical thought and/or a lack of knowledge of canon or a lack of research skills.
