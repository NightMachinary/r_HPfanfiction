While I don't side with the rather standoff-ish feeling of this comment, I do have to agree with the underlying sentiment. Fanfic isn't written for anyone except those who want to read it. While I realise that the community as a whole tends to have standards, or likes and dislikes, if someone has a story they want to tell, who are we to criticize that? Saying they're unimaginative or lack research skills isn't super constructive, and if you don't enjoy a fic, don't read it. I stopped reading Harry Crow recently, because I didn't like the characterizations and overall plot, but the author has found an audience, so more power to him.
