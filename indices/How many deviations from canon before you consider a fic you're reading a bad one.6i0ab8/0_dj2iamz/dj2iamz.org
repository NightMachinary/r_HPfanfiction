To me, canon deviations aren't a good measure of a fics quality. The entire idea behind fanfics is that they're NOT the exact same as the universe that birthed them, otherwise we'd just reread the original books all the time. Especially since so many fanfics hang on differences from canon, like a slytherin Harry, or Draco and Hermione somehow becoming lovers. As long as they state it obviously enough that I know it's a difference and they're acknowledging that fact, I'd read a story where all dragons produce asexually if it's well written.
