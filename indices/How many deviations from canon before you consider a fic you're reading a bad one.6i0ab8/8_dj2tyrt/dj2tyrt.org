Wards are not fanon. Protective enchantments are canon(Fidelius Charm, several other common charms that were used even by the protagonists, Gringotts itself had several enchantments,etc.) and /wards/ is just the same concept taken from other fantasy books with a different name--despite contrary popular belief, Harry Potter isn't /that/ original, it just was the best execution of several things already done in prior fantasy books.

While I agree that quite a lot of deviations from canon are plain dumb, the writing and execution is more important than if it's actually canon or not--a point I don't even consider relevant unless the story is so far away from canon that could be original material, and this is mostly because it's not what I look for in fanfiction, not because it's a bad story. Besides, it isn't like canon is perfect. First, it's inconsistent. Second, it can always be improved. And changing some rules of the world can improve a story or be a fun concept in itself.
