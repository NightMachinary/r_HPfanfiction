linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon) is just about as far from canon as you can get, and it's absolutely brilliant. I've read it at least twice already. I'd say it has a near infinite number of canon deviations, but is still acceptable.

But just a single mention of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6h4s3a/petty_reasons_for_dropping_a_fic/divq9xr/][Christian prayer]] is enough for me to drop it.
