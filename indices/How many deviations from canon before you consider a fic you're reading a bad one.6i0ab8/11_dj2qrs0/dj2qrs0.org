For fanon, it's more to do with type than amount. Certain things just don't work with canon as is, but other things don't work and resolve conflict in cheap ways. Take glamours vs 'I swear on my magic' type oaths. Both of them, if they existed the way they're used in fanfic, break a lot of canon. But I'll shrug and continue reading with glamours because they trend toward being a plot mover that can keep other more interesting pieces of conflict moving. In contrast, the 'I swear on my magic' brings it to a halt so the self-insert of the author can pontificate obnoxiously on how innocent they are and how absurd it was to be accused of whatever.

I dislike pretty much all fanon that involves aggrandizing characters: 'Lord' used in any context outside of swearing and dark lords, 'Most Ancient and Noble' being a legal term, every random character has a family manor, or anything else that sets up the wizarding world as some kind of quasi-feudal society so authors can puff up Harry or whoever into a much bigger/more important figure than they already are in canon. Alternately, I'll happily read Veela or other weird creature fic, and don't really care if a story call things that are referred to as protections/enchantments in the books as 'wards' in a fic. I might roll my eyes at werewolves all having yellow eyes or *movie canon like Lupin having facial scars when nothing like that was ever mentioned in the books, but it's not a stopper for me.

*I do consider movie canon that either contradicts the books, or is noticeably absent in book canon as a drawback to a fic. The 'choosing the wand = picking one that doesn't start destroying things' is the most common one and it sucks. Works better than the book on screen, but a pointless and uninteresting change in fic. Not something that would make me drop it, but ugh.
