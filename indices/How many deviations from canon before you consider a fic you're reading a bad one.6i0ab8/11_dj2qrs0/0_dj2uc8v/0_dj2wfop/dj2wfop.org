Something like that, where it has to be a lot more formal and deliberate, would still be less irritating than a casual wave of a wand with 'I swear on my magic.' I agree I'd rather just not have it even come up than someone use it though. We only ever see one Unbreakable Vow used anywhere in canon and I think it's easy to drop, though stories like Forging the Sword at least work to give it some weight that I find interesting.

Also, the penalty for breaking the vow is death, not loss of magic, which seems more in line with canon. The only things we see that involve any loss of magical ability in canon involve depression on the part of the magic user in question and I'm skeptical it's something that can be permanently/completely done. Yes, book 7 has the whole 'Muggleborns stealing magic' accusation but I take that with the same seriousness I take 'the Jews are poisoning the water which is why I can no longer get it up.' I think 'stealing magic' is one of those ideas things that float around the wizarding world because people know magical ability can fluctuate, but there's never been anything substantiated that would give credibility to the claim it's actually possible (outside of bigoted maniacs running the government).
