Well, I refuse to read "everyone's a muggle" AUs.

But there is no hard line for me. Whether or not I'm willing to continue reading a fic is based on two factors: A (annoying) and E (entertaining). As long as E > A, I'm willing to continue reading. This does include fics that aren't good (Basilisk-Born, for instance).
