I'd just as soon write it off as being intent-based, where the outcome is dependent on what the user expects or wants, both for a physical appearance, and degree of precision.

Honestly it's just a boring thing, but some writers like to inject magic into everything and add unnecessary detail. JKR never explains why Hogwarts has modern plumbing in an ancient castle and how the entrance to the chamber is throw it if it was retrofitted, so some users feel the need to explain it. How exactly students find their way to classes or wake up on time isn't really explained either, but boom magic solves it.

I don't think some things need to be explained, but I don't generally begrudge an author their details as long as there aren't an excessive number of them, or unless they are all tired fanon.
