The tempus spell never made any sense to me. How is the information presented? As an old-fashioned clock face because the spell was invented centuries ago? Digitally because it depends on the caster's preferences and expectations? What about accuracy? Are we talking about atomic-clock precision, or Weasley-clock approximations, like "teatime" and "you're late"? And then there's time zones and daylight savings time...

Perhaps the tempus spell would show some kind of sundial? That would work, I think. The spell would show the position of the sun on a rough dial, not adjusted for anything. The user would then have to mentally adjust for longitude, timezones, and daylight savings time. But why would wizards mess with muggle concepts as longitude or timezones anyway? Do they even need accurate global timekeeping?

If I wrote a fanfic, I'd have to nerf the shit out of a lot of stuff.
