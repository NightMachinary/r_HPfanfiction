okay 1) wtf are you talking about, that is not a common trope;\\
2) there /are/ "wards" in canon, they just aren't described as such, and really why bother introducing specific terminology into children's books when "protection" is obvious? off the top of my head, the Fidelius Charm and Muggle-Repelling Charm both function as wards, even though they aren't described as such /by J.K. Rowling in her books for children/
