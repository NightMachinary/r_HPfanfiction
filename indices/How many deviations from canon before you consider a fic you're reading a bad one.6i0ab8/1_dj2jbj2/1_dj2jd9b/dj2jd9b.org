A common fantasy term NEVER used in canon. And so used in fanon that harry's so often a super incredible warder capable of making wards that will explode voldemort's brain but his dad didn't use this common potter skill to save his family that the whole premise is tainted by shit writers.

Edit: also, i have yet to read cc. Maybe someday.
