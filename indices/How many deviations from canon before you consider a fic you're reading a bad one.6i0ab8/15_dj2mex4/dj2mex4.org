I was tempted to tap out in chapter 1 of Wind Sheer. The scene with Moody was terrible, and the pureblood idealogy was so bland and generic. None of the characters showed any signs of life and were just speaking with the author's mouth. Tons of warning bells going off.

So, I'm not for deviations of canon, but rather, I like things that are potentially and realistically plausible within the realms of canon. And, if they're not, they're at least presented in an interesting and entertaining way.
