I don't really care how far what I read gets from canon because JKR didn't give us a whole lot to go with. She made a nice framework and other people are doing a fucking great job of filling in bits, building on it, playing around and viewing it from different angles.

Is some of it unlikely? Sure. Is some of it crap? Of course. I read fanfic for fun, because I like seeing what other people do in a universe that had loads of potential. All JKR did was end it with people marrying their highschool crushes and naming their kids after dead people.
