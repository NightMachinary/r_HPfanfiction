It depends if it's been stated/being treated as close to canon in terms of that kind of content. I don't mind lots of fanon/original/expanded stuff, provided that they can make it interesting. Huge, rambling exposition dumps about wards don't interest me, but stories where it's both imaginative and easy to follow get solid pass there.

I agree on the /Tempus/ thing, as that spell doesn't make sense in a lot of ways (like, what about time zones?). However, I wouldn't think it's worth getting your ire up about the inclusion of some of this fanon stuff in fanfiction, all things considered - there are so few well-written, technically competent stories out there, that getting irritated enough to quit out of an otherwise good story is a bit of a shame.

That said, /Whiskey Time Travel/ is fucking sweet and I hope it gets continued at some point because it was great.
