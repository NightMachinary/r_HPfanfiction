Now for me, werewolves being silver-susceptible is very very believable. Everything you read has werewolves have a problem with silver so I do not see what you what “scoff hard” on it.

What I have a problem is stories were there is no reason or back-stories or honest way for the deviations to be that way. Like Draco/Harry is a Veela stories? Narcissa is not a Veela. Lucius cannot be one, as there not male Veela. So for Draco to be a veela you have to have someway that is very believable and that makes sense. In most stories, suddenly Draco is a veela at the age 14 with no reason. Gabrielle is a veela, but she is one when she is 7, and 10, and 13, and so on. The only thing is she gets her veela powers when she is older.

As long it is logical and well written I'm ok
