It's slow. 1.4mo words just to cover the space of a single year. There's a lot of drama that, like romantic or sit-coms, could be resolved if the characters had just talked. The story does not wrap everything up. It has a good ending point, like the end of any of the first six Potter books, but there are loose threads.

For all that, it is one of the best written pieces I have read. It is meticulously researched (I've learned a lot from his chapter notes alone). I found all the characters to be in character. I enjoyed the slow burn romance. It's definitely not for everyone, but I liked it a lot.
