I certainly hope so. I've written a one-shot (though for RWBY, not Harry Potter), where two characters wind up singing a modified version of 'Sincerely, Me' from /Dear Evan Hansen,/ where one character thinks he's making himself more appealing to a romantic interest by pretending to be her teammate's long-term best friend, and the other character thinks she's helping the first one establish a mutual cover identity as an independent secret agent, since she herself is one. It's been taken down.

I've also written one for Worm where two characters (one of whom is black) begin singing 'Everyone's a Little Bit Racist' from /Avenue Q/ to two feuding white supremacist groups, which was actually my first attempt at fanfiction, ever. That one's still up, probably because it only features a couple lyrics while the other characters react, instead of detailing the whole song.
