FloreatCastellum does a great job with snippets of the Nina Simone song "Sinnerman" in this chapter of Hollow Ash: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12778140/6/Hollow-Ash]]

As the song plays in the background in the car, it simultaneously serves as foreshadowing for the plot, character building for the Muggle police officer in the story, and sets a nervous, foreboding tone.
