I've seen songs used well for setting a scene in a fic. Like anything, it can be done well or it can be done badly.

I wouldn't suggest popping an entire song into a scene (unless it's some sort of puzzle that the characters are trying to figure out). However, sometimes it's nice to include a few lyrics if the characters are listening to a song that's appropriate for the moment. For example, at the Yule Ball, or Christmas at the Weasleys'. Music can be just as important for describing a scene as any other sense (touch, smell, sight & /sound/).

A few examples off the top of my head:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] has lots of scifi and movie references in it because of the main character's odd personality, so a few song snippets here and there fit with the style of the rest of the fic. Obviously this irreverent style only fits with certain kinds of fics, but there's a poignant scene in chapter 50 that does it particularly well.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14368581/][Of Your Making]] has a few Celestina Warbeck lines when one of her records plays on a gramophone. That kind of scene setting/world building could fit well in almost any fic.
