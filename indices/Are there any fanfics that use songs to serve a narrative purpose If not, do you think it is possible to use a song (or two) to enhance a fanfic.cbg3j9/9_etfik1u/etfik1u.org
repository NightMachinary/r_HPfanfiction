I have used lyrics at the start or end of chapters to add 'punctuation' or set a mood. There's at least two fics I can think of where lyrics from a song or poem are used as chapter titles, and the tone of the chapter usually fits with the reference. Anything more than a quick tag is likely to be skipped by readers as being intrusive to the story. Good storytelling hides the author as a mouthpiece.
