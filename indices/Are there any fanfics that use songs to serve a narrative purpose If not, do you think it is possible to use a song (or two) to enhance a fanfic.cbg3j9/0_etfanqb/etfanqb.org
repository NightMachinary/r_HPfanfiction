I do not know any fics that does this, but I'm pretty sure it must exist somewhere.

Personnaly, I do not think it is a good idea to use a song inside a fic, for the same reason I dislike characters using film or quoting Internet. All of these actions risk to plant too firmly the fic into a period and a culture, while Harry Potter seem to be more timeless.
