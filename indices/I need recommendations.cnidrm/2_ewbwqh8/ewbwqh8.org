linkffn(11446957) I don't know if they really get bashed but I do know that Harry isn't friends with Ron of Hermione. And he's obviously also not friendly with dumbledore since he's a dark wizard.

linkffn(4545504) Has bashing of all three and fits your other criteria quite well.

linkffn(6254783) Has bashing of Ron and Hermione and I don't know if Dumbledore gets bashed but Harry is very much against him so it should be okay.

linkffn(8303194) I just recommend this one so you can see that there are other ways to portray Dumbledore. Still has Ron and Hermione being assholes so you can be happy with that.

I don't know why people hate bashing so much I mean Ron is pretty much in-character in most fics and Hermione has to get away from Harry because you can't have an independent and powerful Harry and then say that Hermione is "The greates Witch of her age".
