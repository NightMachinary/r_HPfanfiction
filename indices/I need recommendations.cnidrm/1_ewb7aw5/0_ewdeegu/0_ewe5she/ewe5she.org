I feel like people blow up the flaws of these characters to ridiculous proportions. Hermione is just an insecure, socially unadept person. She wants to help people and makes friends but doesn't know how so she comes across pushy and rude. Ron is also an insecure person because he has 5 older brothers that outshine him. He wants to become his own person and not just 'another Weasley'. He is definitely jealous, but more often embarrassed and saddened by his financial situation. Malfoy definitely doesn't help by antagonizing him every chance he gets. Molly is definitely not 100% aware of Harry's situation. She has an idea, but Harry is a very closed off person. If she knew the extent of the emotional and physical abuse that Harry has dealt with, I'm sure she would've done something. She treats Harry like a child because he is a child. She doesn't want him to lose the little childhood that he has left. And I don't really want to justify Dumbledore because that would take a while and I've typed way too much already, lol. But to summarize, Dumbledore is not omnipotent and is far from perfect.

Anyways, flaws are what make characters interesting. If they were perfect people the story would've been extremely bland. I just don't like how people take the flaws of these characters and warp them into a caricature of who they are.
