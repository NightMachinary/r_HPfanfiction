Firstly, Hermione seems to be the type of person to ridicule people who are below her, yet get jealous or mad when someone does better. Secondly, Ron is always jealous for some reason or another and only seems go grow up before the final battle. Molly seems to be aware of Harry's situation regarding his relatives and doesn't do much other than feed him, and practically treat him like a child even though he's faced Voldemort more than probably 80% of the order at least. Arthur just seems to be a good man, but a big pushover. Finally, Dumbledore placed Harry either knowing that he wasn't going to get treated well, or thought the best of a family of muggles that Lily probably said hated magic. Furthermore, he continues to place him there, because of blood wards, yet a Fidelis would've been much smarter. Also everyone else just pretty much shrugs off the abuse and neglect like as if it's nothing, while he probably had many problems stemming from that like sight or height loss.
