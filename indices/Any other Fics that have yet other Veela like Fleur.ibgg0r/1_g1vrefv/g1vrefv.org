When a Veela Cries has a whole host of Veela (part of the story is Harry getting to know Veela culture, so he gets to know a lot of people throughout Veela Society) beyond Fleur, and Gabby is fleshed out into a fun character too. Takes a while to get to that point, and the opener is... criticised strongly. There's some interesting stuff and some good set-up there, but if you dislike it enough, skip to about chapter 8 or 9 and you'll get the beginnings of the Veela stuff (it only gets more prominent from there).
