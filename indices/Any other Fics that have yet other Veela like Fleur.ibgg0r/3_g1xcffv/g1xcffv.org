Yeah, I got a few stories I think of that have other Veela characters. Hope you enjoy this list, a few spoilers on how Harry meets these Veela but not something I thought would ruin the story.

*DUEL* - linkffn(9041086) - It's a little later in the story but Harry does eventually go and visits the coven of the Veela or something along that line. It does include a few extra Veela characters of course.

*The Lost Summer* - linkffn(8554615) - Does some neat world building around Veelas while introducing some new Veela characters. It's short, sweet, and simple.

*Amicus Protectio Fortis* - linkffn(11547735) - Again this is late in the story. Harry goes and meets with the Matriarchs of the Veela.
