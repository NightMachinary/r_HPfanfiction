The Definition of Normal and its sequels are fantastic. They start with the rather heartwrenching premise that at a young age, Harry figures out that the dursleys want him to be "Normal," and they will treat him better in the name of that ideal. It's brilliantly fucked up, and the author has a /magnificent/ touch for making every character in the series- including *Voldemort* into an actual fleshed out person with goals and desires of their own. It also has a tremendous amount of worldbuilding, really getting into the fact that wizards are literally an entire alien civilization, with their own culture, traditions, and religious beliefs.
