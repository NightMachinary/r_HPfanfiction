Instead of the obvious I'm going to mention two more obscure fics...

I've recently stumbled upon "Loopy Lovegood", which is an abandoned Harry, Hermione, Luna time-travel fic, with a unique twist:

IMHO it's worth it just for the premise, but I'm a huge sucker for -Ron +Luna, so I'm biased.

I also quite enjoyed Catharsis:

Time travel fics are usually quite trite, but I often notice that it is easy to make them interesting again by adding something special.
