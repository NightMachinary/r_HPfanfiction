Let me see... linkao3(Unforgiven Pride by Laziza) is one I've recommended before. It's an in-progress SS/HG slowburn that deals with post-war politics and stuff.

linkao3(Other People's Choices by Lomonaaeren) is a Slytherin!Harry fic with a twist: Harry's originally put in Gryffindor and resorted into Slytherin when the Sorting Hat falls on his head in CoS. It has some insanely good characterization of Blaise, Theodore Nott, Draco, and Ron.

linkao3(That Awful Boy by paracosim) is a fifth year AU with slowburn Snupin. The best parts of it are definitely those that deal with Snape - he's full of dickishness while at the same time being someone who is deeply determined to do good.

linkao3(A dealer, not a Death Eater by Jaxon) is a Snily AU where 1) they're together and 2) Snape's a drug dealer who's slowly getting sucked into the Death Eaters. Featuring a lot of grey on grey morality and political shenanigans.

linkffn(Courtship by bluemeanies) and its sequel linkffn(Voldemort Wants You to Eat Your Vegetables by bluemeanies) are both hilarious. The first involves Dumbledore, Snape, and a roller disco. The second involves McGonagall being stressed out about the consequences of the first one.

linkao3(Picketing For Peace by Chuksha) is just amazing. It deals with a real event (the 1984 Miner's Strike) and shows how it affects the Wizarding World, whether they want to acknowledge it or not.

Finally, With Nothing On My Tongue by ms_anthrop ([[https://snapecase.livejournal.com/50627.html]]) is an amazing piece with some incredibly deft characterization of both Snape and McGonagall. Also, RIP Alan Rickman and Leonard Cohen.
