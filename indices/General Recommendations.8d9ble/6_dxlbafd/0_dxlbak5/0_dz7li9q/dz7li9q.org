Thank you for the recommendation ! Though I didn't always like how the characters acted /cough/Harry/cough/, it's a really interesting story ! I just read all 60 chapters in one go. I first thought that it would be kind of a parody with the cooking part, but it took a more serious and even gruesome turn at the end, and brought several interesting ideas I haven't thought of. And I got so hungry during the MagicChef contest hmmm..
