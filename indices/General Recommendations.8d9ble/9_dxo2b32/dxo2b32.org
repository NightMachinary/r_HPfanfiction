The fic I'd like to add is Seven Names by angelholme linka03(5265569) which is an AU postwar fic. In terms of why I recommend it, there are admittedly a couple Doylist reasons I should mention first.

It's a fic on A03, which is fine in and of itself. The fact of the matter is though, with some exceptions due to containing rare pairings/scenarios, fics on A03 get /much/ less play than their counterparts on ffn. This is a good sized fic (73.5K words) finished a bit less than 3 years ago and outside of my own mentions of it the only time I have seen it brought up was the random mention of it that introduced me to the fic in the first place. So, IMO it seems to be just the sort of thing these sorts of threads are for.

Moving on toward the Watsonian side, it isn't a perfect fic I will admit. Personally, I think the UAC could use some shoring up in its moral justifications. Not in that those justifications don't exist, but that they weren't articulated by dialogue and chosen plot details as well as they could have been. There is still definetly moral ambiguity in terms of who to root for, but I think fair or unfair the reader leans more one way than the other, and shoring up the (even if only slightly) weaker side would serve to make the fic even better.

But apart from the style of the piece (which I like but as with all aesthetics is a matter of opinion) what it does best is depict war, and it excels in a couple different ways. First is that it goes down the the dark places of humanity, without turning into the grimdark "every likeable person is either killed, tortured, raped or all the above because the world sucks" almost parody material many fics can turn into. But rest assured, it does actually go in and show the nastiness that occurs during an actual war.

Because Book 7. to be honest, did NOT depict that. This isn't a knock on it, not at all. But what it was was a dangerous camping trip mixed with spy thriller that culminated in one final action packed fight. Seven Names shows, in retrospect, pieces of actual campaigns, and more importantly (and the area where I think it shines) is showing the consequences that people have to live with from it, whether individually or as a society.

Because, ignoring everything else, Book 7's "war" made reconciliation relatively easy. The main figureheads of the winning side only particpated in one battle, any harm caused in that battle can easily be argued to be self defense as it was an attack on Hogwarts and even in the heat of battle no "light side" witch or wizard is shown to be doing anything morally dubious like casting an Unforgivable (unless you're a complete pacifist I suppose, but that argument will hardly win the day)

Seven Names shows how, for both people and peoples, reintegration after an actual war is much murkier
