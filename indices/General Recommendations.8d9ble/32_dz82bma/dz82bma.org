With Strength of Steel Wings is my favorite fanfic, hands down, any fandom. And I don't even like Harry Potter. It's a 700k masterpiece of worldbuilding and intrigue, with characters who act like people and a damned good plot. And if Harry's a little bit of a Mary Sue, that's okay, because AngelaStarCat manages to make him an /interesting/ one.
