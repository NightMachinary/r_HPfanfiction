Started last year, so it's possible everyone's already read it, but I've seen very little in the subreddit about linkffn(realignment) and it deserves your attention.

Grindelwald-era AU in which Riddle is attacked during his 6th year by a mysterious assailant and ends up caught in a power triangle between the assailant, Grindelwald, and Dumbledore. Great world building regarding Grindelwald's War and the magic societies on the continent and the relationship between Tom and Dumbledore is believable and very entertaining.
