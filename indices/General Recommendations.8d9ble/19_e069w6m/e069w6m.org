[[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a4fcjlZVc39jSm0vYE2lrRU3ZkAIAC8LwCenVf1e--c/edit?usp=sharing][Here's a massive list of reccs]] I made and upkeep by hand that might be useful; there's a large section dedicated to HP fic that might be useful to peeps here.

Of my reccs, I think two of my favorites are linkffn(4172226) and linkffn(5318441)!

A Hero is a great oneshot where dudley gets his redemption arc a lot earlier than canon. it's interesting watching someone so young have to face facts and try to come to terms with what he learns, and grow from there.

Box on the Stool is possibly the only Kretcher-centric story I've ever come across, and almost unaccountably the best. It really makes you feel something for the little guy and the potter family.
