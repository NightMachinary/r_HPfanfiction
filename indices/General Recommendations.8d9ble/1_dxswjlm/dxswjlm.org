I /highly/ suggest reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7145549/1/Duality][Duality]] by Anda Faith. It's such a shame it hasn't been updated in two years. I assume the writer either outgrew Fanfiction, or life became too stressful with their career as a doctor. It is my all-time favorite Fanfic. There is a [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6881563/chapters/15699223][smut version]] available on Ao3, and a few other sites. It's an incredible story, involving Harry getting into a 'no-strings-attached' sexual relationship with Daphne Greengrass, but the smut actually plays quite a small, but necessary part to the actual plot. Later on in the story, it's Harry's path through becoming an impromptu interrogator for information on Voldemort. I love the way there is actual psychology involved, and that the story has so much information from actual sources weaved into it. The Slytherin's are devious, intelligent, and have plots inside their plots and contingencies for their contingencies. The suspense is amazing, and the writing is incredible. I particularly love the journey through discovering what a Horcrux even is, and the implementation of the Unspeakables being an actual secret, not some infinite resource for Harry and co. to farm from. Add to this the fact that there is actual /lore/ behind occlumency, but it isn't written out like a step-by-step guide comes together to make one of the best stories I've ever read. Sincerely hope it is finished. I'd suggest someone adopting it, but this is the type of story that I think would be destroyed by a different writer.

If you like brilliant character-development and incredibly well-thought-out plot read this story. If you're into greyer!Harry's, this is an excellent fanfiction as it actually has his /journey/ into that lifestyle instead of just him instantly changing from canon.
