I'm not much of a Ron person. Both in canon and fanfic he's ignorant and stupid mostly by his own choice. Also, he needed to be out of the way to make space for the Slytherin's in the story. His character doesn't allow for him to "be apart" of it. But oh well, to each his own, I'm still waiting for this update like my life depends on it xD
