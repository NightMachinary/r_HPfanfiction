linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter)

This fic is an Alanna the Lioness take on Harry Potter that was really refreshing to read. I really loved how independent Harry was in this fic. In this Harry is technically an oc but is still Harry Potter and female. She's trying to pass as her male cousin to attend Hogwarts as this is a pureblood only school in this universe, and her cousin is passing as her to attend the school she was supposed to go to. I don't want to give too much away but I really enjoyed it and I think anyone with an open mind would enjoy it too.
