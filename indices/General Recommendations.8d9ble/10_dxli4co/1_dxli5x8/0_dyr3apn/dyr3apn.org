Some fics I really enjoyed there, although I didn't really see the point in the occasionally homophobic jokes in 'Like a Red-Headed Stepchild' it seemed pretty fun. 'Red Knight' was occasionally a little odd, but generally compelling. 'The Many Deaths of Harry Potter' was fantastic. 'Wind Shear' just seemed a tad generic for me to get into. DP&SW though . . . could you give me an idea what is good about it? The first chapter just seems a parody of god knows how many terrible fics, it may well be better written, but I couldn't see what might draw one in.
