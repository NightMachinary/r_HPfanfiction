There is almost a shoot the moon effect with DP&SW. It has all of these truly awful tropes all wrapped up in juvenile power fantasy nonsense with a thick coat of self-satisfaction on top, but it is entertaining in spite of that.

I hesitate to say that it's so bad that it's good because it isn't good, but it is entertaining in its own way. It's like cheddar jalape√±o Cheetos: not good for you in any sense, but surprisingly hard to stop eating. I can't call it good, but it isn't bad if you're bored.
