It's [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130269][Anthem for the Scraps]] . There are weekly updates.

/Summary:/ London 2002. They have no past, only dreams. They are students (Ginny Smith & Mione Granger) and musicians (Lee & Harry Jordan) finding their way in a gritty GenX world. When a voice rises from a dark Camden Town stage, a quest begins for what has been lost, and what may yet be found.

The veils be let lapse,

And verse lift the soul.

Anthem for the scraps,

Seeking to be whole.
