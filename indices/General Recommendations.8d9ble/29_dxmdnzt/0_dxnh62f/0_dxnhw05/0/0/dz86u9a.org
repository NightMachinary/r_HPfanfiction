As this week, Chapter 6 has been released, I can say a wee bit more by now.

The story is WIP and is updated weekly, on Tuesdays.

It's about a group of young people in London in 2002, the musicians Lee and Harry, who perform with their amateur band in such legendary locations like Camden Town stage or the Half Moon. Ginny and Mione are typical students, often in the library, where Harry also works part-time. In the beginning, Harry/Lee and Ginny/Mione don't know each other. Without knowing it, they all have something in common, they have no or only vague memories of their childhood. It's obvious that Harry and Ginny somehow knew each other in their childhood, but they don't remember. It's obvious that their childhood must have been different as we know it from the books. Oh, and at least Harry and Ginny are aware that they have strange powers (magic) but don't know what it means. As noted in the summary, they unconsciously seek to be whole again.

Oh, and at the very beginning of Chapter 1, Lee gets a copy of Goblet of Fire. I have no idea what that means, but it seems to be important since their past obviously differs from their counterparts in the books.

I can't say more at the moment. I'm waiting eagerly for the next chapter next Tuesday.
