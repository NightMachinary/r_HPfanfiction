I can't remember if I did tbh. It's been a while. I don't think I bothered. The things I remember the most are the exclamation points used every other sentence that gave the story this weird bouncy tone that didn't fit at all, the excessive thesaurus use and the fact that the author made zero attempt to maintain the mood, tone or plot of the original stories.

But hey that's just me. There are a fair amount of fics that I'm a huge fan of that I know are objectively bad
