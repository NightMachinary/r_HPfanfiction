linkffn(Prince by SallyJAvery) is a Venetian AU of about 30k words. Hold on. A Venetien AU. Venetian as in Venice. Before you say what the hell is that, just read it. Its incredible, the phrasing and word choice are on point. And somehow, someway the author still tells an incredible little story. Highly recommend.
