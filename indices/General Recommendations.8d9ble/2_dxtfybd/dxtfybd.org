Late to the party...

Anything by TheEndless7 but especially linkffn(Vitam Paramus) and linkffn(Limpieza de Sangre). Plus his meisterwerke linkffn(Letters by TheEndless7).

One or two Starfox5 stories have already been mentioned but not linkffn(Patron by Starfox5).

And White Squirrel. linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) and linkffn(The Arithmancer) are excellent, although the sequel to the latter is taking forever to get to the fucking point.
