I'd recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12717563/1/The-Lord-in-the-Mist][The Lord in the Mist]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1/The-Aurors][The Aurors]]. The former I would recommended for the fact that the author tends to do interesting and fairly unique things (this story is shaping up to look like it will display this well). The latter is well written with a solid plot and a firm grasp on how to create a compelling narrative.
