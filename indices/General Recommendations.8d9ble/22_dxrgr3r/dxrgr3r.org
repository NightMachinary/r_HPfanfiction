Linkffn(The Little Veela That Could)

It was one of the first long (300k) fics I specifically remember. I'm reading back through it, and it holds up pretty well.

Good action, interesting politics, and a main character that's sweet enough to rot your teeth, yet strong enough to make its enemies have nightmares.

I never hear about the story on here, so I'm interested to see what other people think about the story
