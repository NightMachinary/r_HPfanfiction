One-shot: The Muggleborn Infiltration of Legal Fascism [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12799849/30/The-Ficlets-Archives][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12799849/30/]]

I just read this and had to come here and recommend it. It deals with Hermione trying to change some laws regarding Muggleborn's rights in the Wizengamot/wizarding world.

It's quite short (2,999 words), but I found it good nonetheless.
