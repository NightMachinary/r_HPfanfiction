It does a pretty quick but interesting dive into ginnys's first few years at hogwarts as a slytherin, with how they view her after the diary. Later, she begins to come into her own with a group of powerful women in slytherin who make a place you can thrive if you're different. The sequel has a trans character join them that is so wonderful and well done. Gradually, ginny and Harry start to interact more, but then you see how she deals being left in the castle, and there's inter house unity that isn't in Canon. Harry/ginny is believable in the sequel.
