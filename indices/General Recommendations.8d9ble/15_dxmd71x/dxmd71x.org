All right, here we go!

/The Chessmaster: Black Pawn/ and /The Chessmaster: White Knight/ by Fly Autumne.\\
linkffn(12578431, 12746586)\\
An engaging in-progress series that not only puts Harry, Ron, and Hermione into Slytherin, but fleshes out the Harry Potter world even more while adding several extra-Hogwarts plots. Some involve familiar characters while others involve some rather intriguing and mysterious new characters. I really recommend this series because both the Hogwarts bits and the greater wizarding world bits are interesting. Updates regularly, too!

/Victoria Potter/ by Taure.\\

Female Harry, but actually done fairly well. It's still early in the fic, and it updates rather irregularly, but it's good so far.

/The Half-Blood Romantic/ by Sophprosyne linkffn(12627473)\\
I'm not one for romance fics, to be honest. I rarely read them, but I do quite like Fleur and this was recommended to me personally by a friend, so I gave it a shot. I'm glad I did. It's definitely a romance story, but it's well-written and interesting. The author avoids most of the more annoying romantic cliches, which is a huge plus. Still updates, but somewhat slowly (once every month to every couple of months).

/Weasley Girl/ and /Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past/ by Hyaroo\\

Female Ron. It's an interesting idea, and it's done fairly well. First two years of Hogwarts are done. Follows the canon plot to a certain extent, but increasingly less so as the story has gone on, and I have a feeling based on the events of the second story that it will diverge quite a bit from here onward. I like the characterizations, and the writing is good too.

/Harry Potter and the Master's Ball/, /Harry Potter and the Chamber of the Unknown/, /Harry Potter and the Lord of Sevii/, /Harry Potter and the Grand Trainer Tournament/, and /Harry Potter and the Order of Moltres/ by Mr. Chaos\\

A Harry Potter-Pokemon crossover. The writing is a bit ragged, especially at first, the author has the odd spelling and grammar issue (nothing a quit proofreading wouldn't have fixed), and the author sometimes doesn't check spellings of proper names (e.g. 'Treverant' instead of 'Trevenant'). Other than that, though, it's a great series. The story is mostly set in the new Pokemon region of Avalon, which just happens to be where Hogwarts is located! Characters, events, and a good amounts of the Harry Potter world have been Pokemon-ized, and it's very well done. The plot is engaging, the characters are (for the most part) very well-done, and it's interesting to see what Pokemon each character has. I think Voldemort, Hagrid, Barty Crouch Jr, and a few OC's are particularly fascinating.

Those are my main recommendations for this year. In the words of Marcus Kincaid, "Don't have too much fun!"
