Brilliant perspective of how Lily and James got together. I think I've read every non-slash maruaders fic there is and this is the best one (or at least top two, tough to beat the unfinished 'The Life and Times'). A recent fic, 2017 I think(?), and incredibly well written. Interesting takes on Remus and Peter are probably what make me love it so much. A few lemons, but they are for the most part skippable plotwise, but it isn't gratuitous. Fantastic story, and the author even responds to reviews!
