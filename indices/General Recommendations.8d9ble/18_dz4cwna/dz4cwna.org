"Goodish" young Tom Riddle:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14357283/chapters/33140037]])

It's Luna Lovegood/Tom Riddle and time travel. I like it.

One that focuses on young Severus Snape and Lily Evans, but also does a great job on the Marauders: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5803846/chapters/13376221]])

It's a Snily, but a realistic and really well done one.

One more: Albus Dumbledore/Gellert Grindelwald, somewhat canon compliant before Beasts. Very unique writing, that actually does justice to this horribly sad love, that lasted an entire lifetime and yet never enough. A somewhat tough read, but worth it. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2428940/chapters/5375627]])
