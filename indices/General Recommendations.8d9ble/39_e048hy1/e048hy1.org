There's a series on Wattpad called “The Marauders” written by Pengiwen.

It's pretty cool although there are a few mistakes concerning timeline with characters and stuff like that, all in all it's pretty good. It also follows all seven years, so far she's still on the sixth year (she had to split both year's five and six into two parts each)

It does go into Wolfstar (Remus and Sirius) I don't really ship them but it's not too bad.

I'd say it's a lot more detail especially within the classrooms at Hogwarts then Harry Potter but it also keeps that emotional story telling that we know and love (one chapter made me sob)

It's the first fan fic I've ever actually read other than my own but it's a joy.

So if you're interested in the Marauders time at Hogwarts, give it a read
