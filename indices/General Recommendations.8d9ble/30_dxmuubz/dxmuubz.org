Aside from seconding the recs for The Changeling (It has two sequels!) and The Mind Arts, my two additions for this thread:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12132374/1/Six-Pomegranate-Seeds][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] linkffn(12132374) : Hermione Peggy-Sue where she comes to Hogwarts as a Rosier but Young Hermione still exists, and stays in the background of the main plot. Like the Changeling, it's a strong character piece.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300/1/Black-Luminary][Black Luminary]] linkffn(12125300) : Another Harry raised the House of Black fic, but takes the cliches and executes them well for the most part.
