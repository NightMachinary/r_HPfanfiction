/“COME BACK IN HERE!” he bellowed. “COME BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT!”/

​

/But a reckless rage had come over Harry. He kicked his trunk open, pulled out his wand, and/

​

/pointed it at Uncle Vernon./

​

/“She deserved it,” Harry said, breathing very fast. “She deserved what she got. You keep away/

​

/from me.”/

​

/He fumbled behind him for the latch on the door./

​

 

​

/“I'm going,” Harry said. “I've had enough.”/

​

/And in the next moment, he was out in the dark, quiet street, heaving his heavy trunk behind him,/

​

/Hedwig's cage under his arm. (From PoA)./

​

 

​

Harry stormed along the dark streets of Little Whinging, his anger bubbling inside of him to the flickering of the street lamp. He panted for breath as he stormed away from the Dursleys house, the sun had set but the air was thick and muggy.

​

Distantly screeching tyres could be heard over his heavy breathing as he angrily strode the pavements, his only direction away, away from Privet Drive.

​

Panic crept in, what if the car was coming for him? Would he be arrested? How could he explain to a muggle police offer the magical schoolbooks in his trunk?

​

The heady panic began to overtake him and he started to run, run from the car that had spun the corner harshly and was now slowly traipsing up the road. Harry turned his head and squinted to see if it was a Police car, but with no headlights on and only one flickering street lamp, blinking away ominously it was impossible to tell. Surely the only people crawling the streets at night would be either the Police or an unsavoury man...

​

Up ahead was a small park. He looked down at his wand, still in his hand, and his trunk. If he could get into the park and open the trunk, he could put his Cloak on and fly away into London when they had passed.

​

His mind was made up then, he dodged quickly into the park and tried to find a secluded spot. He ran towards the tree cover.

​

Behind him the car wheels spun as it tried to come over the pavement, burning the tyres and smoking behind onto the road. The car furiously gained traction on the pavement and sped onto the grass of the park, overshooting and crashing against the swingset.

​

 

​

Harry gaped and hid behind a tree, quietly fumbling for the lock on his trunk with one eye on the car, waiting for its owner to emerge. The lock clicking open, he quickly grabbed for his invisibilty cloak and flung it on.

​

The car started to amble forward, no noise coming from the engine. Driving straight towards him in the trees. Harry squinted at the car, something about it was familiar to him...

​

Joyous laughing filled the air as the lack of driver became apparent, and the familiar light blue of the Ford Anglia came into sight.

​

Harry quickly stepped away from the path the car was taking and tried to scale a tree. The car paid no heed to the evasion attempt and lifted up into the air and merrily flung open its door.

​

Tauntingly, the car tipped sideways slightly to remind Harry of this time last year, when the car had been driven by his friends, the Weasleys, to rescue him. Of course, the car then went to live its life - once saving them from being a snack for the Acromantula of the Forbidden Forest.
