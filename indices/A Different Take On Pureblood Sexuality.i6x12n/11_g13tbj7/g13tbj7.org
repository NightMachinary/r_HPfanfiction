On the flip side, I could see quite a few blood-purists treating Muggles somewhat like nineteenth-century slave-owners treated their slaves - as a resource to be used however they see fit. Given the amount of mind-affecting magic available, I have no trouble seeing some of the Death Eaters using a Muggle to satisfy whatever appetite they have (sexual or otherwise) and either Obliviating or disposing of them. Someone like Lucius Malfoy wouldn't sully himself by going out into the Muggle world personally, but he and others might have a "fixer" who knows their tastes and procures suitable Muggles that won't be missed.
