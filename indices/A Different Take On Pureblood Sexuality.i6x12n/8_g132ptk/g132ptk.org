There's no indication that magical society in Britain is at all Rapey in canon.

Some people want to write that. Shudder.

I like to push this different idea . Power comes from the point of a wand.

A witch is just as magically dangerous as a wizard.

I'm not going on a wands as guns rah rah line here. It's more subtle.

Everything witches and wizards do, they can all do, if they learn how.

Daddy forcing girl into arranged marriage? Daddy gets poisoned if the girl is sufficiently upset. Everyone does five years of potions. Even Merope Gaunt, home-schooled, inbred as all get out can make powerful potions. Once her family are in Azkaban she pretty much does what she wants to.

Young witches have friends; so if Jenny Arthweith gets groped by the lastest Goyle lookalike , he's going to get taught a lesson by her friends.

So this could escalate to murder and disposal of bodies, but that's Lucius Malfoy grade stuff. (My headcanon is that he's had guest in the basement before)

Dead magical people can reappear as Ghosts. Lets reiterate this. It makes it really hard even if you hide bodies.

And divination is actually a thing, (even if Sybill's a phoney) so solving unsolved crimes is a thing.

Unless you're Mytle Warren, muggleborn with no friends. Her family wouldn't be able to engage with magical crime solvers, and it was hushed up. And Tom R covered his tracks well.

So I think of magical people as being much more like tigers. They don't occupy each other's territory (all those houses in the country aren't for show) , and only the young are in a school. Makes courting more formal; it's a safety mechanism. Even in canon, young witches are prepared to hex in the bits. So, manners.
