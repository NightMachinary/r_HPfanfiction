Aren't 'super sexually repressed' societies usually the most depraved ones though?

- look at Pakistan and the widespread sexual abuse and trafficking of (not always) homeless children there. Same with India.

- look at Japan, where it's taboo to show romantic affection in public yet there's a widespread issue of men groping girls on the subway but said girls being too afraid to mention it lest they disrupt the crazy, every minute matters, Japanese work mentality.

Or how they're leagues ahead of others when it comes to creating sex dolls (the literal sexual objectification of women). Or how they're the region where anime and hentai (the sexualization of young highschool girls) originated.

Did you know there's a job for underaged girls in Japan where they dress up like anime schoolgirls and give massages to creepy old men?

- the catholic church and its priests: I don't need to explain this, surely?

Sorry, I was making this point to show how it makes perfect sense to me that death eaters would be rapey, depraved bastards. It's often those pretending to be most virtuous that are most evil. Middle eastern societies are the greatest hypocrites in this regard. And Jeffrey Epstein liked to call himself a philanthropist.

P.S. I don't mean to say that we don't have this in the west. Just look at how Epstein and his whole ring of politicians, lawyers and entrepreneurs got away with their crimes ... or how some of the most evil pedophiles are for some reason Australian.

Also, 'animalistic tendency'? Pure bloods aren't aliens, they have hormones and feel urges like the rest of people. Sexuality is a vital part of a person's life. So again, seeing it as a 'animalistic tendency' would be repressing it.

Being open and adventurous is healthy. It's what makes teens realise what is and isn't normal and what is and isn't acceptable.
