I dislike rape as a plot device, but I most often see it being used as a way to show off that pureblood society doesn't consider muggles, or muggleborn witches and wizards, to fundamentally be people.

After all, animals can't give meaningful consent, and exist for masters' use. It's a gross perspective but one that makes sense with how the Death Eaters treated people.
