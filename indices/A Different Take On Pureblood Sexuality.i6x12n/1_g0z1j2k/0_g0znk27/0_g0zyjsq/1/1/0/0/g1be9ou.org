Yeah, Voldemort is pretty much utterly indifferent to the pleasures of the flesh, because he's not really human enough for it anymore.

Much like his claimed pureblood status, I could totally see him letting that happen so long as it brings in money to fund his schemes and gives him blackmail material to force others to obey him.
