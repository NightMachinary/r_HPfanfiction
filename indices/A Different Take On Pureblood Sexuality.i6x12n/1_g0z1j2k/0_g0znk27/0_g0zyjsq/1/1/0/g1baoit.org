That's exactly the circles Lucius Malfoy runs in. Not every rich and powerful man is a pedophile or serial rapist in the real world, but the ones who do exist get away with it because of their power and their friends in high places.

In my basic head cannon world building Albraxus Malfoy runs a pedo/kidnapping ring, and Lucius inherits it. In some of my stories he murders Albraxus and burns that shit to the ground, but in others he keeps it going.

It just makes too much sense that while Voldemort wouldn't actually be a pedo that he'd use the knowledge that several high standing and powerful men are and use it to manipulate and blackmail those men to get his way.
