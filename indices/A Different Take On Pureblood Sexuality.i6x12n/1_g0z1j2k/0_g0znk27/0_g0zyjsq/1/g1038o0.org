Malfoy, like with murder I'd say that he isn't opposed to the idea and might say as much (after all he has been asking for a genocide since age 12 and no one cared). However, just like with murder I'd say that he would chicken out but wouldn't mind if it would happen to one of the Mudbloods as long as he didn't have to get his hands dirty himself. Although his proficiency with the Imperius is slightly worrying.
