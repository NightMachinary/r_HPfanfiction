  Now Malfoy raping half of the Hogwarts girls would be more than one step too far, but Death Eaters? Snatchers? The werewolves who unleashed themselves in Voldemort's service?

Yeah, I wouldn't expect Draco Malfoy to be a rapist, not even Pure-blood Death Eaters - Lucius Malfoy, Yaxley, Nott, Avery - would think of doing such a thing because of their marriage and mindset of superiority, but it isn't hard for me to imagine Snatchers and Werewolves finding Half-bloods and particularly Muggle-borns and using them as playthings. It isn't written in text, but the subtext when Hermione got kidnapped by Greyback was very creepy and dark and it felt like it was leaning towards this direction.
