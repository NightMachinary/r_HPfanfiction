My run with this topic would be that pureblood culture, at least in Britain, simply doesn't put such a premium on sex. Maybe it's seen, apart from the necessities of procreation, as little more than a diversion for lesser creatures such as animals, muggles and teenagers; a true wizard of witch of the proper blood and upbringing would seek pleasure and the exercise of power in more "refined" ways.

In this interpretation:

- Fenrir Greyback, the closest thing canon has to an outright rapist by main force, is of course an outcast and /other,/ an "animal" of whom sexual violence is /expected,/ because he is a werewolf - and a walking propaganda piece for the dehumanization of werewolves at that.
- Merope Gaunt, the OG outright rapist of the 'verse, is likewise an outcast, an outsider - a withered last fruit of a fallen, once-proud bloodline that was either cast out or cast itself out of British wizarding society for the most part.
- Eileen Prince/Snape was an utter failure as a witch, that is, as a /magical/ woman. Instead of living up to her blood, she went the way of what I imagine being pretty close to the stereotype of a Muggle woman among the Wizarding pure-blood elite: a miserable, subservient, downtrodden creature without the will to extricate herself from under the boot of her uncouth, uncivilized, filthy and usually abusive husband. Such women would be held in contempt by any respectable witch, who would be expected to respond with equal parts aplomb and cruelty to (attempts at) such treatment from men - or, for that matter, women.
- Molly and Arthur Weasley's evident physical affection for each other into their middle age, and the resulting large brood, would be a part of why they are seen as gauche, improper and less-than.
- Nobody in polite Wizarding society would raise an eyebrow at the childless state of many Hogwarts professors (as they don't, as far as I know).
- A(n unpolluted, pure-blood) Death Eater would not only never dare to rape a target, but not even entertain such thoughts in Voldemort's presence, for fear that he might pick them up and Crucio the offender for being disgusting. Maybe there'd be a pejorative term from it, inspired by "zoophile".
