AntonBrakhage, I completely agree. But we must also realise that rape is almost alwayd a part of war. It's not only an evil act/urge by enemy agents but also a psychological weapon.

But it shouldn't be written out in detail in a fanfic like it's a smutscene. Rape doesn't have to be extremely descriptive for it to be harrowing.

If you do feel the urge to write out a 5k words rape scene then I'm starting to question the audience you're writing for.
