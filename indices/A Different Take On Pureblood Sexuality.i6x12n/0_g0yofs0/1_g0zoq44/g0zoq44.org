See also rape isn't about sexual desire. It's about power. And a society that covets power and sees sex as "dirty" is actually more likely to use rape as a method of control/a weapon. Because if all the women think Sex Is Wrong, its something that can be used as punishment, and a punishment that the victim will be ashamed of and keep silent about.

ISIS use rape as a weapon of war despite preaching a very strictly repressed sexual code in general.

Societies that are open about sexual desire are less likely to produce sexual abuse because a) people can be open about their desires and find like minded people rather than repressing it and getting weird about it and b) said societies have strong consent education and victims feel more empowered to speak out.
