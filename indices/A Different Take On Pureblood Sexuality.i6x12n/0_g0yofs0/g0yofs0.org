Two things:

1. I completely agree that rape should not be used as a casual plot device. Especially in, Jesus Christ, stories centered around kids.
2. A highly repressed society and a sexually abusive society are not mutually exclusive things. In fact history has shown that they very often go hand in hand. See: the Catholic Church, or Victorian society in general. All the repression means is that the ugly shit is going on behind closed doors, and the victims will be stigmatized if they dare to speak out about.
