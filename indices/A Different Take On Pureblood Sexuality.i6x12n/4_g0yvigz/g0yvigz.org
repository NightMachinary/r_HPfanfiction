It's rare to find Fanfics that show genuine understanding of repressed upper class politics, especially considering that pureblood society probably closer reflects 19th century Upper class society.

Because of this, the sexual violence in these fics is often unhinged, really unhinged and not connected to the power structures at play. I'll go against the grain and say here thay if a Fanfic is dealing with adult themes Im open to an author including sex and sexuality including sexual violence if sensitively written and not just for voyeurs sake. Lucius Malfoy can be a horrible father by, I don't know, locking Draco in a punishment cupboard rather than some of the gratuitous violence I've seen people use to try establish his "badness". Nine times out of ten it will absolutely turn me away from a fic.

These old societies did have sexual violence but it was often subtle or bizarre by modern standards. Not always, obviously, but people writing these themes with carelessness should be prepared for people not to like it. I've read real life diaries where a woman was traumatised because the Lord of the house insisted that he watch her dress in the morning by refusing to provide her quarters with curtains and going for morning walks. This is more on brand for repressed pureblood society. I just really dislike reading a fic where it turns into Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. They're allowed to make it of course! I just smash that back button.
