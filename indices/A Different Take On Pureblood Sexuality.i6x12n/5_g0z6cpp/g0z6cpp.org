That could make a fun Idea : Hogwart finally hire a sex ed teacher and they spend their time ripping their hair when confronted to the pureblood ignorance on sexual matters(I have serious difficulties picturing Lucius Malfoy giving the Talk to Draco)

Imagine a whole class of young pureblood, red-faced, as a muggleborn sex ed teacher finishes their course : "and that's how you have sex... Questions ?"
