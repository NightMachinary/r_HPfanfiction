There is a similar fic on ao3, where the school decides that enough is enoug (after two teenage pregnancies in one year) but none of the teachers wants to hold the sex ed class. In the end they all have to teach it at some point but give up because of some incident or question. It's quite amusing, if not exactly what you described. Sadly I can't find it anymore.
