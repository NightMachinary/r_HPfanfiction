This is basically what was headcanon for me right from the beginning. Wizarding society stays "fixed", while muggles go through bust-and-boom cycles. For muggles, sexual pleasure strikes very well in the low effort - high reward sector, while for wizards there are so many other things possible that it just does not make sense to be promiscuous.

Also, the population size is much lower, so a pureblood who was rather open would either be killed or shunned.
