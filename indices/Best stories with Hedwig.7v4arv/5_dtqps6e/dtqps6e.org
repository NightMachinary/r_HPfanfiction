"A Boy, a Girl, an Owl, and a Train Compartment" by BrokenWingsHealed lives up to its name. Harry meets Luna on the train in a slight variant on OotP, and she and Hedwig take an instant liking to each other. This is the first in a series of stories depicting Harry and Luna as a couple, although that future connection is only hinted at here. The subsequent stories are mostly set post-Hogwarts and so don't really feature Hedwig.
