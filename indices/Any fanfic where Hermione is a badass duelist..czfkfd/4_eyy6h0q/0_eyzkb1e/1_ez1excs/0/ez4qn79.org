(I've only read the original 7 so I don't know about their skills after the 7th year, so can't comment on that.)

Battle of the Potters? Is that cursed child?

How can you be good if you regularly gets taken out quickly often enough that you need to mention it?

We never once have a duel where fatigue was a determining factor so athleticism isn't a determining factor, especially considering most fights are done with within seconds. Also, athleticism doesn't not grant you speed, it depends on the activity that gave you said athleticism. And honestly, Ron isn't the greatest Quidditch player, he couldn't even get the position fair and square.

The troll charm was a lucky break in a tense situation and not representative of Ron several years later when most of the actual magical fights happen. And if you really want to include the use of 'an unorthodox spell cast in the last second in a perilous situation' as proof of skill then I would point you to when the snatchers caught the entire trio and Hermione was the only one to react in time and Hex Harry.

When Hermione silenced Dolohov she did it at the end of Fifth year, and at the time she had not been taught Non-verbal magic. So pardon her for not predicting her opponent being perfectly capable of silent cursing when she hadn't even been taught of its existence. (Officially, she likely knew it was possible, but predicting and compensating for something you've never been taught does not make you terrible.)

Ron tricked his way away from the snatchers, he didn't duel or run from them.

Neville, Luna or Ginny are never described as being better than their peers in DA yet those three could hold their ground in the Ministry.

PS: The Snape comment was a compliment to his skill, the same as Percy and Molly. That's why they are outliers, because they are shown to being way more capable than expected for a potions teacher, house-wife and a pencil pusher.

Edit: Replid to another comment and found a few more arguements; While Harry was figuring out how to get out of Gringots she held off the Goblins. When escaping the ministry, at Godrics Hollow and at the Lovegood tower her fast actions saved the entire group.

At Luchino Caffe Dolohov singlehanded bound Ron, evaded Harrys stuning attempt while Harry was invisible only to get body-bound by Hermione after Hermione had dragged a stunned Ron into cover.
