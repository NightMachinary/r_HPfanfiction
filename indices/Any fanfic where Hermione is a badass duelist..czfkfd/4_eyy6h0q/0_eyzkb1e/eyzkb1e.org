Who is a good duelist then? Harry is definetly not a dueling prodigy considering all of his hardest fights he gets out by virtue of Deux Ex Machina or through surprise advantage. We never read Ron as being better nor worse than Hermione. The rest of DA seemed rather even with each other.\\
Honestly very few fights are settled in a protracted test of skill and/or power.\\
A few outliers are Molly and Percy during the final battle, and Snape actually managing to just barely maim Fred during the broom chase.
