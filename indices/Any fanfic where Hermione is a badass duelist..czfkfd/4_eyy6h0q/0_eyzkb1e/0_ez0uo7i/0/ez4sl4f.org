Sigh... why is Hermione a bad duelist? Because she is not the best duelist? Because she thinks Harry as better than her? She also thinks Harry is a better speech performer so does that make her bad at speeches? She thinks Ron is better than her at Chess so does that make her bad a chess?

Of course it doesn't because it's a faulty argument.

While Harry was figuring out how to get out of Gringots she held off the Goblins. When escaping the ministry, at Godrics Hollow and at the Lovegood tower her fast actions saved the entire group.

At Luchino Caffe Dolohov singlehanded bound Ron, evaded Harrys stuning attempt while Harry was invisible only to get body-bound by Hermione.
