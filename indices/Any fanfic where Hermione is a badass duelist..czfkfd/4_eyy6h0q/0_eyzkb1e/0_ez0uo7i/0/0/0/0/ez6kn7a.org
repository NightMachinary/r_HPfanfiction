She's definitely more magically skilled than her peers. But dueling isn't just about the number of spells, but rather using them in a fashion. Hermione and Ron are about the same level per Order of the Phoenix when it comes to actual fights.

I don't like calling her exceptional though. She's smart, smarter than her peers, whenever the book doesn't have her drop the idiot ball. Rowling calls her a borderline genius, and for the most part, I like this as her characterization. She works hard though. She's an /excellent/ researcher. Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Snape are exceptional. Even the Marauders are as well, at least magically.

Definitely should have clarified though.
