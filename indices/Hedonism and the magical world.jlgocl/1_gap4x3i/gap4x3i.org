This is an interesting point; I'm getting a Dorian Gray sort of vibe here; what happens when the upper class with access to too much time and magic on top of that gets bored? If you've not seen/read the Magicians, I'd suggest it to you as something that fits the criteria. It's definitely a facet of certain character's personalities in that series.
