Purebloods being a bunch of magical Slaanesh worshippers is a pretty interesting idea, and one I'd like to see in a fic (though it would probably have to be rated M).

That said, I'm not sure if the Wizarding world is really a post-scarcity society. There are certain limitations on using magic for sustenance (e.g. food cannot be created out of thin air, although water apparently can), and there are pureblood families that are poor - the Weasleys or the Gaunts, for instance.

Besides, as of the last book, Magical Britain has seen three wars in half a century, one of them spanning at least a decade. That doesn't really seem like a good envinronment for such hedonism to thrive (well, except maybe in the immediate aftermatch of a war).
