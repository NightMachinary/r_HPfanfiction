You know this would be a great tie in to the real world ideas of why magic is evil.... Remember this; The Church of Satan in the real (modern) world is less about evil and more about free will, philosophy, Free speech and thinking. Then you have those minor off shoots which are about hedonism. These were all things common in the roman empire, but with the rise of Christians those were seen as Evil. With the rise of Christianity hedonism was often seen as one or more of the 7 sins. Now its basically seen in HP canon that the statue of secrecy arose sometime after the fall of rome. Maybe this is the reason why. I mean maybe the wizards lack common sense about danger is because of the fact that magic can cure just about anything thats not done with dark magic. And if we look at the feasts they clearly don't care about eating healthy or staying fit. The closest we see to exercise is Quiditch. Also when Hermione fixes her teeth with magic and straightens her hair in GoF We see that magic can fix faults in ones looks(Beauty is in the eye of the beholder {Hermione Thought those things made her look bad.}) So clearly magic can solve almost any body related problems. The only thing we see that can't be fixed easily is death and dark magic. Now maybe the whole GoF thing was not a problem either since the Romans did that often. Maybe Dying for Fame and Glory is worth doing in the WW. Similar to how some cultures believe the greatest death is on the battlefield. I could go on and on but I think I made my point.
