I don't think it would make a good Hogwarts fic. With tight security, the Malfoy plot is done, not that it would come to be. And whatever dark forces make an appearance would be pretty minor and disorganised.

What you describe would work as a more general divergence with the story starting after graduation as it gives everyone time to organise forces. You'd have two dark groups terrorising the country and an almost fascist ministry. That would be a pretty interesting base for a post-Hogwarts (but not post-Voldemort) fic. Diagon was a ghost town in HBP. Now imagine trying to find jobs in that environment. Fudge would still be in office, trying to fuck with Harry&co. And Dumbledore could die to the Horcrux before Harry graduates, making room for lawlessness. Hunting Horcruxes would be a lot more difficult if you have to maintain a public appearance.

Also, a minor nitpick. It would be better if Bellatrix went down very early due to a lucky hit (eg one of the shelves collapses and a big splinter goes through an atery or something like that). That way, the Death Eaters would be suddenly very disorganised and the whole thing falling apart quickly would be more believable.
