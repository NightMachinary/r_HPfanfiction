I thought the premise was the majority not believing that Voldemort is back, which would require him staying in the shadows and not openly doing much.

The main cast we're concerned with chose not to flee even after the ministry was fully taken over and Dumbledore was dead, so I don't think they would; and while Dumbledore is alive, I don't think he or the order would let the people still at Hogwarts be a part of Order operations as they were in OotP, as one of the order's main goals at a time a war isn't active would be to protect the younger generation.

With Dumbledore alive and already planning to train Harry and take him Horcrux hunting etc as in HBP, I don't think Harry and co would have any further motivation to quit school, especially Hermione Granger being who she is.

I just don't see why them staying at school at 16 is even a question that needs to be explained, it never was in HBP itself.
