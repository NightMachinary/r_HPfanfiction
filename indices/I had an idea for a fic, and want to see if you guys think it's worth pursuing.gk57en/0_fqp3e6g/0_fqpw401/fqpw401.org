Well, without an actual war out there, Dumbledore being alive, getting their NEWTS and completing their studies to maybe have an actual future could be a good enough reason, no?

If Death Eaters aren't running Hogwarts, it's just Ministry "oversight", people wouldn't think about leaving for the same reasons they wouldn't in OotP.

Also, most of the main cast would be 16 for most of it if it's set during canon HBP.
