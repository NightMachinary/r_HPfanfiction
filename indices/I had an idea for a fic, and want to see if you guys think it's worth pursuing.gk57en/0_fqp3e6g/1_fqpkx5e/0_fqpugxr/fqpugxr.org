Isn't putting the age of adulthood at 18 just lazy writing, though? The point of divergence is supposed to be the death of Bellatrix in Azkaban and nowhere do I see in the post the word 'AU'. The writer should find a way for the main cast to stay at Hogwarts (maybe they have to do something and it can only be done at Hogwarts with Dumbledore) or they'll have to deal with the fact Harry, Ron and Hermione will most likely want to quit Hogwarts once Harry is major.
