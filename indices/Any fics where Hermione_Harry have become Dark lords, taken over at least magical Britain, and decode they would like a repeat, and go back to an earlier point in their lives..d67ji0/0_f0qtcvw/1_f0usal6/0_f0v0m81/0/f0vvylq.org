you are right of course, is just that I don't like it, my biggest complaint in this fic is that Hermione is just too much of an overloaded character, super smart, super-powerful, parallel thinking, snake familiars, possible fae contractor, potential Dark Lady, and whatever else surely got added after I stopped reading, and Harry is just like... there, the only thing he has is foreknowledge, take that away from him and he has no reason to exist, he doesn't even feel like a sidekick, just a handler.

As far as luna goes... yeah, the whole "I only can have myself as a daughter" is beyond creepy, and I really like the usual Manic Pixie Dream Witch characterization, especially when done by eloquent authors, this one for me was just jarring
