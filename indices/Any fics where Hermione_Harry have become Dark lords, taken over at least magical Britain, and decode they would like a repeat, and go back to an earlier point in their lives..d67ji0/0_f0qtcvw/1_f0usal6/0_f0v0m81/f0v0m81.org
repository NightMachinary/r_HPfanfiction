It's a different feeling than Harry being overpowered himself, you must admit. And Harry remains (mostly) the one with narrative peered power because of the foreknowledge. Which, admittedly, time travel is my jam.

I've seen several spins on fairy!Luna, mostly not done very well, but again it's a step away from her usual fanon characterisation as Manic Pixie Dream Witch.

Overall, it's just the only fic I could think of that mostly fits OP's pretty narrow search, and it's at least technically competent and reasonably well-written to boot.
