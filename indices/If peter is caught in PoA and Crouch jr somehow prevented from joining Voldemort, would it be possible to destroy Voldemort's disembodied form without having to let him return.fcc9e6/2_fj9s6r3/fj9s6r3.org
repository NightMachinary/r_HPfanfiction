In canon, it's uncertain - but I would say that /no/, you cannot destroy that form as it stands. You would need to hunt down and destroy all of the horcruxes, and only then could Voldemort's spirit form be actually destroyed.

I think there it's debatable whether or not simply destroying the horcruxes would be enough to kill him instantly, or if you'd need to add in one final destruction or disruption to his form to finish him off.

Catching wise, it's also not certain - and presumably takes a very specific situation to happen. But I've seen some people use it in FF to somewhat decent effect. I think personally I'd make it so that Voldemort could sort of 'consume' a horcrux to get out of that situation, just to let him keep being a threat.
