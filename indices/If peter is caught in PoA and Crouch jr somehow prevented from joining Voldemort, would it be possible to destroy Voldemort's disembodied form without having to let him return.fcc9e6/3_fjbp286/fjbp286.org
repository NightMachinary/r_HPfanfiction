I do not think that it is possible to destroy Voldemort's spirit by itself. It is after all nothing more than a soul kept on the portal plane by its Horcruxes. Something giving a direct attack on the soul (like a spell or the Dementor Kiss) /may/ work, but I don't think there is any spell to attack the soul (even with the Killing Curse, the victim dies, but can still pass on to its next journey), and as for dementors, it's discutable if they would be interested in something like that and/or able to absorb something without a body (they can't "Kiss" a ghost as an example).\\
As for capturing it, I think, potentially, it would be possible. The whole Philosopher Stone obstacle course in PS looked like a plot to capture Voldemort (maybe by making him look into the Mirror of Erised and letting him get caught in his dreams), and since it's possible to "trap" ghost, the same could be possible with Voldemort spirit (would looking into the eyes of a Basilisk petrify him?).

But, since the Horcruxes are presented as some of "anchors" for his soul to remain in the mortal plane, I would guess that destroying all of them would force his spirit to "pass on" without the need to truly destroy him. Would make a pretty anticlimatic ending for a story thought.
