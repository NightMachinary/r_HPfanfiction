Interesting, would Riddle be different if he grew up with a loving family or would he still go Dark, possibly running off to travel with Grindelwald, after offing his siblings. Dumbledore's life would depend on what the other two do, he might be killed off for being muggleborn or welcomed as a strong wizard to help conquer the muggle world. I can't remember if Grindelwald hated muggleborn or just us muggles. There are many ways to take this. Wish I could write worth a damn. Was the time traveller Harry? Could be one of those Harry's who feels wronged by both.
