Incapable of love is not the same as no loyalty. Tom is evil because that's what he chose to be, to seek more and more power. His first murders were either Myrtle (who was in the wrong place at the wrong time) or his paternal family (who refused to call him family and who cast his mother away - which I cannot and will not defend because I think they were right to do so even if they should have taken Tom from her).

Give him a family that loves him and is loyal and take him out of the abusive orphanage and Tom might make different choices. A Tom who does have to spend summers in London during the Blitz , who doesnt have to spend formative years terrified of dying to a bomb being dropped on the orphanage, might make a Tom who isn't obsessed with death and immortality.

Could be interesting to explore.
