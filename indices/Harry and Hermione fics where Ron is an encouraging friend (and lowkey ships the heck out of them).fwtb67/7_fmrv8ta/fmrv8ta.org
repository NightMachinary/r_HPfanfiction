Harmony happens with a friendly Ron more often than this sub believes, it's just a lot of the popular cliched ones from years ago have bashing in them so it's assumed that's the norm. Yeah, Ron's jealousy is rightfully used a fair bit since it's a huge part of his character, but that doesn't mean it's a harmony faux pas to not have Ron immediately turn into Umbridge when Harry asks out Hermione.
