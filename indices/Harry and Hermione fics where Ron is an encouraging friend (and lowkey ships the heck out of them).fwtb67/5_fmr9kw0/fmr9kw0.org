There was one I read a while back where Ron and Hermione had a mutual split post-DH, and then Ron bet Hermione that she and Harry would be together within 2 weeks or something which Hermione naturally denied but ended up losing the bet.

It was really refreshing to have a well-wishing Ron like that, which makes it all the more frustrating that I can't remember the name.
