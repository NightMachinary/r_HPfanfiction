On Ao3, there are 233,837 HP fics at the time of writing this post (4/8/20, 9:08 PM EST)

109,118 of them are M/M, or 46.66% of all HP ao3 fics.

37,528 fics are Drarry, or 29.81% of all M/M fics, also 16.05% of all HP ao3 fics.

11,107 fics are Snarry, or 10.18% of all M/M fics, also 4.75% of all HP ao3 fics.

The issue with Voldemort fics on ao3 is that people tag them either:

- Harry Potter/Tom Riddle

- Harry Potter/Lord Voldemort

- Harry Potter/Tom Riddle | Voldemort

Luckily, if we filter by the third pairing, that gives us all the 5,687 HP/LV fics in any form, or 5.21% of all M/M fics, also 2.43% of all HP ao3 fics.

Surprisingly, there's only 800 Lucius/Harry fics on ao3, only making up 0.73% of M/M fics, or 0.34% of all HP ao3 fics.

In short, these four pairings comprise 55,122 fics, 45.93% of all M/M fics, and 23.57% of all HP fanfic on ao3, which is insane, considering it's only FOUR pairings.
