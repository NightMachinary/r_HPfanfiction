Fics that do this properly would be golden, mostly because this very ship is split between two militant sets of fans:

1) Diehard Harmony shippers who bash all the Weasleys except the twins, maybe. Add in a sprinkle of Dumbledore-bashing while you're at it. These are called Harmonians.

2) Rabid, canon-worshipping Romione fans who attack on sight the moment they get even a hint of Harmony, whether in conversational, text, fic, image, or any other kind of form. If you're not with them, then you're their enemy. They only deal in absolutes between canon and non-canon, with the latter being deemed the biggest sin on Earth.

On the one side, you've got Harmonians who want to override canon with their own ship, and on the other side, you've got the reverse mindset where, er, 'Romonians?' bask in their canon victory and refuse to even consider the possibility of two good friends getting together. Oh, and they hate the films and, especially, Steve Kloves too. Their favourite word in the entire dictionary, and the main weapon in their arsenal, is 'platonic'.

It takes a smart mind to stand in the middle and go: Hey, Harry and Hermione are a pretty decent pairing that could've developed in the plot, had J.K. Rowling wanted to go that route. They've got a solid foundation to start a relationship over time, irrespective of their differences and, perhaps, conflicting personalities.

In real life, two friends like Harry and Hermione would have a solid chance of one day ending up in each other's arms doing more than just 'platonic' hugging. So it'd be great to find a fic or two where Ron is neither villified (by Harmonians) nor anti-film worshipped (by diehard Romonians who want to show that they know The Book Canonâ„¢).

In canon, Ron definitely displayed jealousy and hostility towards those getting closer towards Hermione (basically Viktor Krum). But we shouldn't forget that Krum was an outsider, whereas Harry was just as much of a friend, if not better, to Ron as Hermione was. So, naturally, I can see Ron definitely wanting his best mates to be happy in each others arms.

Thanks for coming to my Harmony-Romione Ted Talk.
