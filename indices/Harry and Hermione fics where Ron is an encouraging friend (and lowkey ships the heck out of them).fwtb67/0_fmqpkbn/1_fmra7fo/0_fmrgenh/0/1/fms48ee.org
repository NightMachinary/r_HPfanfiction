It is! I went through my list of fics I finished and the title seemed to fit, but I thought it had been longer than 11 chapters. Thanks!

Now that you say it, I think I did feel the epilogue was too sudden. In the end, I think they kind of drift apart and the remaining couple is Ron and Hermione, right?
