I'd imagine it's either distaste for Ron (and therefore they don't see what they write as Bashing, just accurate interpretations of his character) or a need for conflict in their stories and him being the easiest, semi-logical foil for a Harmony ship, given that he's the one she got with in canon. Pings a similar place on the infidelity radar, at a guess.
