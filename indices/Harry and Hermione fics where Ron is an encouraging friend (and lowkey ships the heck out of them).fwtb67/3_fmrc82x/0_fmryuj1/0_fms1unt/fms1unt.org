If you want a source of conflict, then not bashing Ron is actually the much better way. A hostile idiot!Ron or Potion!Ron doesn't generate much of a conflict - more like a curbstomp usually - and it's a binary one. A good Ron being a rival for Hermione's affection on the other hand, that's a conflict. You don't want to hurt your rival, you want to remain friends with him, and yet... you also want the girl.

(Of course, in such a constellation, Ron could win out. It happened to me when a story I originally planned as a Harry/Hermione story ended up Ron/Hermione because as I wrote, Ron ended up winning her heart. Entirely through me writing what I considered their most likely actions and reactions, nota bene - it wasn't planned out up until the scene where Hermione made her decision.)
