I never said it was good - just what I think their reasoning was (first rule of psychology - reasoning only has to make sense to the person doing the reasoning :D).

But honestly, IMO any trope can be good for anything, if it's used right. Potion!Ron can use the Pureblood-Law Tropes in conjuction to turn a basic romantic conflict into a big political governmental one, for instance (It's not illegal for a Pureblood to potion a Halfblood/Muggleborn, so any protests is pointless, unless you change things, etc). Hostile!Idiot Ron could become a catspaw for somebody else, or end up leader of a (metaphorical) witchhunt mob, or luck into revealing a secret Harry and Hermione wanted to keep safe, etc. No bad tropes, only bad uses of them. :)

I do think your idea could definitely be interesting. I completely misread that line about Ron winning her heart and was going to say I hope you write that story in the future, but it's one you've written already, isn't it?
