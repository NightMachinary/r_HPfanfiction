This is why I've never liked this concept. Forget that wizards are basically made of 60% magic all by themselves, if it were actually possible to take away someone's magic then they'd do it to life-in-azkaban inmates, for example. The DE controlled ministry would do it to muggleborns. The DEs themselves would do it to "blood traitors".

Not to mention conflicts in the past that would end with swathes of people being magicless because they were captured and neutralized without killing them.
