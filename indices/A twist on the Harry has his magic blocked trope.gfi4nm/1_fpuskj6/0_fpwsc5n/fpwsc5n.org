I remember a fic I read, where everyone used to be magical, but the people now known as muggles wanted to use earths power and did a ritual, which backfired due to mother nature/magic didn't like that, after a few generations there started to be people who hated magicals for having something they didn't. It was a frikin amazing idea and currently a headcanon of mine. :)

Sorry for the rambling
