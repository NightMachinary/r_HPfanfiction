  a) Hedge witch is a term coined by Rae Beth in her 1990 book /Hedge Witch: A Guide to Solitary Witchcraft/. It describes a solitary practitioner of a Wicca-like religion. According to Beth :

  /This is rather like the old-time village wise woman or wise man: one who ‘knows' and worships the Goddess and her consort, the Horned God; one who practices spellcraft for the purposes of healing and teaches the mysteries./

  b) Hedge witch is derived from the Old High German ‘hagazussa' via the Anglo-Saxon ‘hægtesse' and means ‘hedge rider' -- referring not to a physical boundary hedge, but a metaphysical one. I first came across this definition on Dawn Jackson's site in the early 2000s and have since found it reflected in subsequent books and websites on traditional witchcraft. Sarah Anne Lawless states:

  /The word hedgewitch comes from the Saxon word haegtessa meaning ‘hedge-rider'. The hedge in hedge witchery is not a fence of shrubs and wildlife, but instead represents the border between our material world and the otherworld -- the unknown./

  Both of these definitions, while containing a kernel of truth, are based on assumptions. By examining these assumptions it will become apparent that neither is fully satisfactory in a historical sense, and that an alternative source may be necessary to explain the term.
