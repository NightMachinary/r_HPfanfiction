I didnt know that. I have watched Game of Thrones, but I have not read the books (even though I know they are supposed to be very good and I do have the first one), because I only have them in German and they translated the names of Characters and places, and I just couldnt get through reading about 'Jon Schnee' ^^ It just hurt me.

But that seems like a good explanation for some fics. Even though I think many fan authors use it more for people who just dont have the power level and not as someone necessarily poorly educated...
