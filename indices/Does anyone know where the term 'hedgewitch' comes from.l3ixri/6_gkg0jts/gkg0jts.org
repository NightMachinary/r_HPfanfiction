I suspect these writers have picked it up from Game of Thrones rather than more historical sources.

A common trope is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight-errant]["knight errant"]] - a wandering knight, often depicted romantically/heroically.

In Game of Thrones, George Martin took this concept, gave it a cynical twist and referred to them as "hedge knights" - wandering knights without land, who can barely afford horse and armour. The bottom rung of chivalry, barely worthy of the name.

A number of writers appear to have adopted Martin's "hedge" terminology to refer to a person who belongs to a certain class but is barely worthy of the name, e.g. wizards who are so poorly educated they know very little magic.
