/A Song of Ice And Fire/ was first published in 1996 (and GRRM started writing it in 1991). "Hedge Wizard" appeared in [[https://annarchive.com/files/Drmg163.pdf][Dragon Magazine #163]] in 1990. So tell us, HOW did people adopt a term from GoT a year before GRRM started writing it?

As a little trivia: the Hedge Wizard writeup was written by Gregg Sharp, who might be known to some of the older ones of you as Metroanime.
