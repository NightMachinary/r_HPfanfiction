Hedge Witch is a term used during the middle ages for a person that lived on the edge of a community most near a forest away from town with a Hedge row of bushes fencing their property away from others.

They were the healers and wise women of the community. They had gardens and used home remedies that were taken as witchcraft or magic but were put up with because they were so helpful. It was only after the church of england wrote the pamphlet on how to find and kill witches that they ended up being hunted instead of beloved by their neighbors.
