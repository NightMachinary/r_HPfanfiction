A bit of digging found references in fantasy gaming and literature at least back into the 1980's- in particular early editions of Ars Magica (c. 1989) refer to Hedge-wizards as an NPC archetype. One discussion suggested that it derived from Elizabethan term 'hedge clergy' referring to uneducated rural priests.
