Since I work on a bunch of different things at the same time, I use a rather complex naming scheme:

#+begin_example
  [Story Title Acronym][Arc Number].[Chapter Number] - [Specific Title]
#+end_example

For example, the latest chapter I was working on was =SVSL01.07 - Burning Sunshine=. Or, when not condensed: "Stealing Victory at the Speed of Lightning, Arc 1, Chapter 7: Burning Sunshine."

The specific titles I use also tend to follow a pattern. Usually they're one or two word descriptive phrases, but SVSL uses =[Verb ending in -ing] [Weather Phenomenon]= as its titles.
