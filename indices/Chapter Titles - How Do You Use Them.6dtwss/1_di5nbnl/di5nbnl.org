In Like a Red Headed Stepchild each chapter title contains a pun or joke that ties in with the rest of the chapter. The best one in my opinion is Chapter 4, which is titled Chapter 3: Maths are Hard. The joke is that Mrs. Weasley cannot count all of her children accurately and keeps thinking Harry is one of them.

In the rest of my stories I usually pick a title that reflects the theme that ties the chapter together or just a nice quote.
