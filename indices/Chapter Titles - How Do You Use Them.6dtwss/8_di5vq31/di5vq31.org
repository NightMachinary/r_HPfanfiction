I'm terrible at coming up with titles in general. Only one of my stories has what I consider to be a cool title. My longest fic has a very generic title (though the sequel's title is better). I grouped chapters by three so I only needed a title once every three chapters. I tried to come up with titles that weren't totally disconnected from the chapter's content, but wouldn't be gigantic spoilers.

On principle, I harbor a hatred for writers who come up with cool titles.
