I title my chapters with some sort of reference to events in the chapter, but that's more for my own benefit so I can remember what happens in it. I do have one story where all the titles are phrases from 'Paradise Lost'. Trying to be clever, I suppose. I don't think many people noticed. Or perhaps they were too polite to call me out on my pretentiousness.

Favourite title . . . probably 'Mad, Bad, and Dangerous to Know'. Or maybe that's just my favourite chapter. Dunno really.
