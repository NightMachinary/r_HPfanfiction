Mine are mostly random. I am so bad at naming chapters, that occasionally I'll just put "No Title", and it annoys me every time.

One of my most common styles of naming chapters is always "something AND something", or "this AND that". For example... "Discussions and Theories".

But yeah, aside from using AND, they're mostly just random, and have never been thematic, like yours OP. It is one of my worst peeves in my own writing, titling chapters...
