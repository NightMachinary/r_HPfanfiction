I have a big old folder, but without reading through them all again here's the one I'll link you: [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/amethyst_jackson/KLFTB.html][Kissing Lessons for the Beginner]]. I won't swear to you that the writing is the best, but it's funny and not in a loopy, ridiculous way. That makes it a nice change from a lot of H/Hr writers who take it so damn /seriously/ (not that I don't like a lot of those as well).
