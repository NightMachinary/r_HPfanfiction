Not that it helps much but I remember reading this as well. It went just a handful of long chapters but was a fun action thing. I'd swear it came from one of the regular Harmony-type writers like canoncansodoff, chemprof, rohata or possibly disobediencewriter, but I skimmed their collections without finding a good candidate.
