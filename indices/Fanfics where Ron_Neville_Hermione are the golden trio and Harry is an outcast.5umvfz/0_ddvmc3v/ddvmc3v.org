linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning) - Harry's parents are in St. Mungo's, and when he learns about magic he becomes obsessed with finding a way to cure them. Neville is the Boy Who Lived, Ron and Hermione are his best friends.

Harry's aims are completely orthogonal to the struggle against Voldemort, at least until Voldemort starts getting in his way.
