Hey, thanks for the reply! Super fun to hear people's thoughts on recs. I do agree that some of the elements (like those you mentioned) are sort of implausible given the Dudley we know. I run towards tolerating some OOC-ness if it makes for a good story, and since canon Dudley is basically cartoonish it didn't bug me as much. 100% agree with you about the ending!
