Thanks for the rec!

It was a fun read, though I got to say Dudley regularly boxing, swimming, playing in chess tournaments, doing mock history news reports, programming video games, and working with robots on top of his school work was a bit of a stretch, especially when you think that earlier that year in canon, he had issues adding the amount of presents he was going to receive on his 11th birthday. Also, yeah it was marked as complete, but that ending felt way too sudden.
