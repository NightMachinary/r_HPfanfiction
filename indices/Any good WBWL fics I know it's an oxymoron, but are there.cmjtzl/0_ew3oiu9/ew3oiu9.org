if you can get past the numerous spelling mistakes and grammar errors, i think /Too Young To Die/ had a lot of potential. Honestly, i think with a good edit it could become one of the better fics using this particular trope, because of its original plot. This Harry doesn't give a shit about Voldemort and Dumbledore. His only goal is to resurrect his dead sister.
