If you haven't read it yet I REALLY recommend Antithesis. In my opinion it is one of the only genuinely good WBWL fics out there. The emotions feel real and are well written. The usual tropes are written in quite an refreshingly good way. This is the WBWL fic that all other WBWL fics want to be.

Being abandoned and abused doesn't turn somebody into a well adjusted badass.
