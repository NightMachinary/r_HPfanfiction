It's not complete, but so much is written, ready for you to sink your teeth into it. Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin is absolutely a great story and I eagerly wait for every update. It avoids a lot of tropes and I see a lot of things that I haven't found in other fics. I heartily recommend it!
