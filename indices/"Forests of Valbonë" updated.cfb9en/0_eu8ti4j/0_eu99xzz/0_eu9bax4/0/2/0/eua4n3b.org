No- he was muted on their IRC because of the 'argument'. Which is.. a generous way to describe that, frankly.

In response to that mute, he nuked the community C2 that he created, but to my understanding it was a group effort involving the whole site. That resulted in him getting banned, not the argument itself.

That said, this whole situation is kind of a series of fuckups.

This is how Xiph0 described the argument:

#+begin_quote
  People were discussing what made a good King and if there ever had been good Kings. I threw out Darius the Great as an example and some criteria (good administrator, raised standard of living, etc). He disagreed and I asked what the objection to Darius was. His response was to say 'assume we'll disagree on everything and let's just not'.

  Nothing crazy there, but enough to get you muted for a couple days just for not having a basic sense of civility. 
#+end_quote

Which is, frankly, a ridiculous reason to mute someone. Especially someone you have a previous, negative, history with. Which to my knowledge those two have never gotten along well. Civility is a fine thing to expect, but that was hardly outright rude or uncivil.

Enembee's response was also completely out of line, too. Assuming we take Raven at his word, and Enembee never contacted anyone that just makes it that much worse.

In the end, I think multiple people fucked up and it lead to this. I've got no issue with Enembee getting banned, honestly, but I think they should have some moderation changes and clearer guidelines for them. Maybe even some sort of small punishment for Xiph0, if they can think of something that fits. He didn't do anything horrible- he just muted someone that didn't take deserve it.
