Doesn't that "mute" or discourage option make it harder to use the site as a whole? So I can see nmb trying to contact another mod and getting frustrated. TBH if someone had shat on me the way that Xiph character shat on nmb on a bad day, I might have responded like that. And the mod is being enabled and excused from the whole affair they started in the first place.

Ridiculous, to punish someone who literally backed away from arguing with you. What kind of internet dictatorship is that place? Anyway this is good warning to never try to start an account there. The users concerned about the impact this will have on community growth were right on, at least in my case.
