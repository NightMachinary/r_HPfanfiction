Wow that Xiph0 person comes across as a massive massive asshole. If that's how mods are expected to behave (and there's even Stockholm-syndrome like comments from users about how it was funny when Xiph did it to them) then yikes. The corporate speak excuses from Raven are also hilarious.

From my understanding, the "discourage" setting makes the whole site frustrating to use, yet Raven says nmb could have contacted any of them through it at any time? And nmb was put on discouragement for more than a week? Xiph is a massive asshole and I'm surprised other users haven't left in disgust. And Raven and other mods enable them IMHO.
