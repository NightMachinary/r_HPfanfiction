- He handed out 47 second chances to everybody, and ignored warnings and facts until they smacked him in the face after things blew up a la end of Order of the Phoenix.
- "You can't mess with time Harry." [Obliviate Bad End] or [Forced Oath not to meddle End]

Obliviation is still in play, remember Marietta Edgecombe?

- Dumbledore will just sit on the information until it is useless. Horcruxes anyone? He didn't start on those until it was too late.
- "You need to have a childhood Harry" and then Harry gets cut off.
- Will most likely make him stay at the Dursleys anyway.
