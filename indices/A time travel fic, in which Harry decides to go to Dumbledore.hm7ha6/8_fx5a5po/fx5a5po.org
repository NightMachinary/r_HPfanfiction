How about someone other than Harry?

linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) has Severus offered the chance to return to the year after his breakup with Lily; he can't relive that, but "everything else would be up to you." He works closely with Dumbledore to end the first war without needing a second, hoping above all else to keep Lily safe this time. It's unfinished, but the author is very organised and updates monthly.

(And, of course, with Severus having decades more patience and maturity, and turning his back on the Death Eaters, Lily is willing to give their friendship another chance.)
