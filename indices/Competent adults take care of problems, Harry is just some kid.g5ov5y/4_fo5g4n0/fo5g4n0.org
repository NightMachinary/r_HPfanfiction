There is Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

There is also another one where serious breaks a compulsion spell for him to go away to an island. He instead stays and takes care of Harry, but I can't remember which one that is.

Edit: Ah that would be linkffn(A Marauder's Plan by CatsAreCool)

Also I can't garuntee anything about Weasley bashing. I don't screen for that and don't particularly remember
