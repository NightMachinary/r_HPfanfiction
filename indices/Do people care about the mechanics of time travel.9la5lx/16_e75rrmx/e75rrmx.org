Only of it's relevant to the story, like if there's a return component lined up or it happens during the plot. If time travel's meant to be a part of the plot rather than, say, the entire plot, then you need to put thought into how it's supposed to work.

Time turners are useful in that regard, coming pre-packaged with strict limitations on what can and absolutely cannot be done.

Incidentally, the super time turners are one of the reasons why I treat HP & the cursed child as a non-canon event happening in fanfiction-land. That and the fact that Delphini is the dumbest villain I've ever heard about. If step 1 of your plan involves fucking with causality, then it's a dumb-ass plan and you need a better one.

However, if your plot is to plonk a random character in some distant corner of space-time with no way of reversing the original process, then you can get away with not explaining sweet bugger all. You can have them do anything from waking up in the new time with no warning to going into a walk-in wardrobe and coming out during the apex of spaceborne human civilisation, Narnia-style.

It all depends on what you want to do with the time travelling.
