The only thing I really need to know about time travel is whether it's open ended (the future the traveller comes from has no impact on the past and the traveller, like alternate timelines) or closed loop (the way the future changes influences the traveller).

Even then, it's mostly so I can avoid the second type (because unless your idea of time travel is a normal time turner you're just not going to manage the story without massive plot holes).

Anything else, well I don't really care. If you can write it down in an interesting manner (and without writing in obvious logical holes) and/or is plot relevant, I'll happily read it, but it's of no importance to me.
