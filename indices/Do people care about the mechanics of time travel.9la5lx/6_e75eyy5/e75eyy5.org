Leave out the details of time travel since nobody cares about the dynamics (unless they manifestly affect the plot - see linkffn(6256154), e.g.)

In fact, 99 times out of 100, you're better off just leaving out the first chapter since nobody will read it anyway. They're functionally all the same: blah blah old life, throwaway drama, something happens, "cliffhanger," skip to chapter 2.
