Depends on story. World-building story exploring paradoxes, multiple universes, closed time loops? All benefit from a tight self-consistant and explored mechanics.

Character driven story with character tossed into the past and focusing on them dealing with it? Better to hand wave the details rather than do a half-assed job of it.
