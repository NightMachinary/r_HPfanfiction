Basically it boils down to whether they can change what they remember. Time turners are canonically the universe option, they can't change what they saw, bad stuff happens if you meet yourself, everything they do already happened.\\
Multiverse is like most timetravel fics, they get to go back in time, either physically or mentally, armed with knowledge of the future and can freely change most things and they'll never return to the future they departed from.

You show it by having the characters either super careful to not mess things up ("We can't be seen" etc.), or deliberately trying to avert problems with no care for the effects on time (immediately stealing the diary from Ginny in diagon alley and destroying it then heading to the chamber with a couple of roosters) or with the only concern being that changing too much invalidates future knowledge (letting Wormtail escape so they know when and how Riddle will return)
