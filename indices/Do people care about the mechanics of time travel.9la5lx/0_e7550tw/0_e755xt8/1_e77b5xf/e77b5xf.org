If we were honest, we would need to have a well-learned protagonist who can sort out the differences in history to make out in which universe he is.

It might even go completely unnoticed except for that one change 1941 where a man died, never getting children, that had children on their own, - and suddenly a Hogwarts child is missing and nobody ever heard of that family.

Does it have an impact on the story? It might - if one is willing to write 'deep' enough into the butterfly-changes.
