I only care about the mechanics of time travel as far as they influence the actions of the time-travelling characters.

I don't care if they use a hyper-temporal-quantum-beamshuttle or a transdimensional ultrawarp platform to travel to the past and what ridiculous pseudo-physics powers the thing.

But what's important is whether we're in a "universe" setting in which the characters have to care about not messing up the future they came from, or a "multiverse" setting in which the timeline they arrive in is separate from the original one and they don't have to worry about accidentially removing anyone out of history.

When writing time-travel stories, I bend the rules of time-travel to suit the story I want to tell.
