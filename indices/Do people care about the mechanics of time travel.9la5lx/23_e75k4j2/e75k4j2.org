Is read the story either way. When authors try to use existing things (like Time Turners) and expand on the mechanics of how they were able to get the character back in time, that's when it starts to get a little off putting.

If you're using something new and especially if it's working and mechanics is a central part of the plot, then I'd enjoy reading about it
