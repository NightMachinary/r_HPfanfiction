I think that for time-travel you need to define which kind of paradox is caused by travel, and that needs to remain consistent across the story. In canon I actually think JKR got it right here (I'm excluding Cursed Child here, because it seems to play by its own rules). In PoA, JKR establishes that the HP- verse operates on a fixed timeline. Harry sees who he thought was his father casting the Patronus charm when it was always him the whole time; the trio thought that Macnair killed Buckbeak, but it was actually a future Harry and Hermione who saved him. The thwack they heard was the axe going into Hagrid's fence in anger. Things like that. When Harry and Hermione used the time turner to go back in time, they were in effect going to do things that they had already done. I think this is a neat and tidy way to handle time travel because you don't need to keep track of the paradox in and of itself; I feel that it doesn't distract from the story.
