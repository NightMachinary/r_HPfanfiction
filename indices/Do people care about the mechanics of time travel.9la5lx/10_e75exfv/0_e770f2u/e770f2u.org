One plot point I've seen in regards to time travel in HP, when people want to change things without breaking PoA consistency, is that the timeline changes in such a way that a paradox can't happen -- if you change the past, things "realign" themselves so that things /did/ happen that way, even if it's very implausible (this also explains the nonsensical McNair behaviour in PoA).

Thus, you "can" change the past, but the universe will always clean up your mess. Save James and Lily? Well, clearly they were just polyjuiced doppelgangers that night. Or similar.
