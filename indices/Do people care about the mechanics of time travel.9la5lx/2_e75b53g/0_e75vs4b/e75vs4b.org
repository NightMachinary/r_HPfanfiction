I tend to agree with this.

When I read time travel fics I usually just skim through the intro portion until the travel event occurs. The chapter-length exposition on why the time travel happened, how it happened and how the time traveler prepared (if at all) tends to get repetitive. I'll go back and reread that section later if the story turns out to be extremely good or if it actually becomes relevant to the plot.

It's a breath of fresh air when authors skip writing that chapter completely to just begin "/in medias res/." It's more interesting if the backstory is a mystery that is gradually explained through flashbacks or conversations with other characters.
