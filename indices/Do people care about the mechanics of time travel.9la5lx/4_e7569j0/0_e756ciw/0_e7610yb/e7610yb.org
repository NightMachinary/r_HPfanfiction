I like it. Simple, quick way to show a "magical accident" time travel.

The only reason to delve deeper into it is if you plan to have Harry attempt travel "back home" (either some reasearch, trying and failing, or succeeding).

Don't get bogged down in the minutia, the reason I love time travel fics are to see the traveler interact with a new peer group and to try to fix things with future knowledge.

The specific methods of the travel are secondary, beyond how they impact the plot (prepared or suprised, what's brought back with them or left behind, can it be reused, return trip or one way, etc). You don't /need/ an exposition of in depth research to share these answers, and doing so when it's unnessesary is more likely to annoy the me as a reader than leaving it to the bare-bones would.

One "best of both worlds" options could be to have your resident researcher share the summary of their findings in your fic, and write a companion oneshot of a research paper they "published" on the topic (perhaps referenced in a discrete author's note).
