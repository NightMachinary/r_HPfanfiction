Much prefer accidental/unintended travel so you don't have to address the issue of 'why didn't they just use this before?'

I also like something like linkffn(10016768) where they just don't bother to explain it at all, its just an event that happened before the story started. Focus on the story rather than what led to it happening, we'll figure out the rest as we go.
