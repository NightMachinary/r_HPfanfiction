I do. Absolutely.

I don't have a problem when a fic allows for different kinds of time travel than canon does, but the author should at least have a basic understanding of the different types of time travel that exist and how they work. If there's a single timeline where you can make changes that affect the future you absolutely can not have people sitting in the 'future' waiting for something to happen in the past. It makes my brain hurt (cursed child is such bad fanfiction).

I just expect the barest amount of logical sense - unless it's a comedy or crack!fic: Nonsensical time travel can be funny.

IMHO authors who don't really care about this kind of stuff should just stick to "time travel sends you to alternate universes" explanation. It gives them the most leeway, without having to worry about paradoxes.
