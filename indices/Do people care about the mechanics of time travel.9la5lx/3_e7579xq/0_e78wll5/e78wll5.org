I hate that too, or the traveller having to "hurry" back to the future because they were in the middle of a battle or something.. I read a story where harry timetraveled during the DoM battle, and he was angsting every chapter over having to hurry back to the future because sirius/his friends were in danger.. and at no point did Harry realise that the future didnt continue while he was in the past.. the lack of logic hurt my brain!
