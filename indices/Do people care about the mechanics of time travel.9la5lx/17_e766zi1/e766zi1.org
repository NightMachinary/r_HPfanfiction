I really like the way linkffn(12734980) handles it. Hermione can't remember how she ended up in the past and has some of her other memories missing. It eliminates the need to explain the hows of time travel and skips the boring chapter(s) where the main character is in the "present." Time travel fics usually have at least one boring/extraneous chapter where it explains what is different from canon universe and why the character is traveling back in time or how the accident occurred that threw the character back in time or a scene where the character interacts with a deity when it usually doesn't matter to the overall plot.
