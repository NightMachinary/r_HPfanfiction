I would be much more accepting of time travel in a fanfiction if people would stop their attempts at explaining how it works. - Time Travel is illogical and is believed to be impossible in real world physics. Your faulty attempts to explain it using "the magic of sacrifice" or "his dying wish was so powerful" or "he cleverly set up the time turners to turn at nearly the same time, a second difference between each, - allowing him to enter the cascadea field of endless time where the gods reside". Now we suddenly have gods and some weird pseudo-scientific method of entering a plane of said gods, wut?

The only time travel fanfictions I have found to be an acceptable read were those in which Harry fused with his younger alternate-self. It just made more sense to me than him going back to his younger body, being as powerful as a 1000 year old merlin, remembering ANY detail of his life and then not changing anything of importance, except for the fact that HE gets the GIRL!
