I think very few people actually want detailed "pseudophysics" information about how time travel literally works, they just want to know how it narratively works. If it's a one-time accidental thing meant to create a plausible past setting, make it clear they can't use it willy-nilly. If it can be used more freely but within limits, describe what those limits are.

The reason why this explanation is wanted in the first place is because time travel can easily be a setting-breaking power, and if time travel is used to do X in one situation, there should be a reason why it wasn't used to do X in all these other situations where it would have been extremely helpful. Otherwise your readers will think "well why didn't they use this convenient time machine to solve this problem" which makes your characters seem dumb, and your story unsatisfying, since you introduced a universal plot solver into your story and arbitrarily stopped using it.
