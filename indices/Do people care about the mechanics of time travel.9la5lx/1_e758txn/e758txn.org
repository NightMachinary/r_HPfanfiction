As long as its consistent.

Come up with your rules, and don't break them (or, if you really want to do sci-fi, break them in an interesting way and then explore the ramifications of that)

The important thing is consistency. One of the reasons people got annoyed at Cursed Child is because the time travel is so radically different from PoA.

(Also because it's poorly written and has a hackneyed premise)
