It honestly depends on the story and it's focus.

There is a huge difference between the films Primer and Looper. If Primer had really faulty time travel then in all likelihood I would have disliked it, however I know Looper has faulty time travel yet can still enjoy it.

The main question I think someone should ask themselves before starting a time travel show is if your story is ABOUT time travel or merely USING time travel.
