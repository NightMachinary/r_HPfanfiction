I don't care if you used a time turner (used a lot), the veil (Oh No, Not Again!), a second chance after death (common LESS plot), a potion (Backwards with Purpose), or some other kind of artifact (Delenda Est). As long as you are consistent, I only really care about the story that develops with it. Really, the time travel is usually just a setup of a story, and is generally unimportant afterwards.
