That's your personal opinion, I can respect that. I don't agree with a single word of it, but I can respect it.

On copyright though: so if you spent a few years working on something- book, movie, research paper, business plan, whatever it is. It's ok for someone else to come along, take it, and slap their name on it and take all the credit and money for it? That's theft, plan and simple, and saying I would be pissed if this happened to me would be an understatement.
