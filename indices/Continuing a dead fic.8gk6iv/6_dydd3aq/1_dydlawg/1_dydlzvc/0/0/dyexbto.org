"and slap their name on it and take all the credit for it"

well i did say "that means you have to say what your deriving from" in my original post so they cant take the credit. regarding the money I meant copyright shouldn't exist in the ideal future where money also shouldn't exist but I wasn't clear about that so I understand the misunderstanding, I acknowledge at the current time copyright is necessary for some to keep up there livelihood (but maintain it would be wrong for JK to do so, she is far past the point where she needs the income to live)
