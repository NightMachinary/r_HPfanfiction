Uh... if JK told me to stop, it would be down in a heartbeat. She could definitely sue if she wanted and honestly I have no idea how it could be “wrong”- it's her property, she has every right to do so.

Not only that, but ignoring a request like that is so disrespectful to the creator. Do people do it? Probably, but that doesn't make it right or any less disrespectful.

Would I still write for myself? Yes, of course. It would just stay in a folder on my computer never to see the light of day like it did for years before I decided to start posting.
