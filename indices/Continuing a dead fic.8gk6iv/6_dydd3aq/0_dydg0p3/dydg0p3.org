The idea of anyone succesfully being able to do that is completely ridiculous:

Judge: Mr. Doe, please explain to me in your own words why we are here today!

FF-author: Well, I'm the writer of a Harry Potter fanfiction and someone just stole my story idea!

Judge: Huh, I was under the impression that Mrs. Rowling owns Harry Potter?

FF-author: *heavy breathing intensifies* Well, yeah, technically I guess, but I own my original plot ideas!

Judge: Okay then. Would you be so kind to elaborate on the details of your so called "original plot"?

FF-author: Sure, no problem. So, Harry Potter...

Judge: Sorry to intercede so early, but I think we already established Harry Potter isn't your original idea

FF-author: Yes, yes, please let me finish, sir. So, Harry Potter goes to this Magic school called Hogwarts, but he is in House Slytherin instead of House Gryffindor!

Judge: Ah, I see, so you came up with this school and the different Houses and all that?

FF-author: *nervous laugh* N...n..no, that's from the original books. But you see in my story it turns out that Snape, the Potions Professor at the school is evil and he cast an evil magical spell, the Imperius on one of the students.

Judge: I have the sneaking suspicion you didin't invent this Snape character or the so called Imperius spell either?

FF-author: Not really, but in the original story Snape isn't a bad guy.

Judge: Ah yes, of course. Very original Mr. Doe. Lets stop this here. You made it clear to me that you don't own anything of substance in regard to this intellectual property and I refuse to waste more taxpayer money. Case dismissed with prejudice.
