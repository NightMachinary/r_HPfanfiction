fanfanfic writers have the EXACT same obligations to fanfic as fanfic writers have to source work. that means you have to say what your deriving from, what you dont have to do is ask permission.

also like fanfic writers to source work if they say you cant make derivative work you ignore them and do it anyway, if JK told you to stop you wouldn't right? no reason to let some any other author stop you.

of course legally speaking they might be able to sue you but it would be morally wrong for them to do so (just as JK could sue us all but it would be wrong)

like just cause there indie doesnt change a thing just treat them like they a author (respectfully but not taking any shit if they try and tell you you cant derive cause you sure can derive, dont matter what they say)
