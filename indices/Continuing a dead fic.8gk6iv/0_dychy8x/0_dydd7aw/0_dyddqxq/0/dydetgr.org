*shrug I follow death of the author so my respect of the work is independent of my respect for the author. I guess if a author I respected were to ask me to take something down I might but more likely the act of asking me would burn any respect I had for them Plus every instance I know of this happening has been against gays or smut so the very concept is kind of poisoned for me
