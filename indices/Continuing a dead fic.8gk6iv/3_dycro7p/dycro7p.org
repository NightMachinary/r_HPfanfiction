I'm not an author but an avid fanfiction reader, and nothing breaks my heart more than getting emotionally invested in a fic only to realize it's incomplete and hasn't been updated in years. I think it's a great idea to continue an abandoned fic after getting permission or giving proper credit. Give us readers closure!
