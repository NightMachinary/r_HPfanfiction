If you copy the original text without permission, it *is* a copyright-violation, regardless of you giving or not giving credit.

And while the fic author doesn't own the setting or characters, they do own their prose and wording 100%.

Fact of the matter is: If you copy enough of a fic without permission, you're infringing copyright.

However, the probability of anyone suing you is practically zero.
