Crediting something does not mean it is not violating a copyright. Given that it's fanfiction no one is going to put the time and effort needed to actually like bring legal action against you. Copyright infringement and Plagiarism are two different things entirely.

The only way, technically speaking, to avoid copyright violation is to get permission for usage. However, given that fanfiction isn't copyrighted it's kind of a moot point in that regard. Just out in the real world, as it were, they're two distinctly different things.

As a whole 'adopting' things without permission is, in my opinion, in bad taste.
