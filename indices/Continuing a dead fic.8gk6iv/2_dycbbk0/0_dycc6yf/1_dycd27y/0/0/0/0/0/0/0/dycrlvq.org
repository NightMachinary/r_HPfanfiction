  but there is no real difference in inherent artistic merit in being n-th level derivative and n+1. The best one could argue is that doing so let's you be "lazier" since you didn't build up the prior stuff yourself... ok.

Yeah I considered this, but IMHO this only applies if you do an entire rewrite of the HP novels (without using any of Rowling's plot ideas, which kinda defeats the purpose). If you continue an abandoned second year fanfiction there's less "prior stuff" (1 Book Rowling+FF-author) than when you do a post-Hogwarts story (7 Books Rowling). Does that mean the former is less lazy? Maybe? Maybe not?

Wouldn't it depend on how many original ideas are put into it? As you mentioned there are different categories, like canon rehashes, etc. But if both of those continuations put in the same amount of effort, the fanfiction continuation should be less lazy no, since it has less "given" to work off? The whole notion of this just sounds silly...
