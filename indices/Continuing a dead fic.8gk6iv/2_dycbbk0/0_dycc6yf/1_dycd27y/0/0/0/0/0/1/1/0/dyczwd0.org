  How would it be looked upon if I were to rewrite bits of it, give all credit where it's due, and then finish the fic how I saw fit? Would this be crossing a line, or would it be fine?

That's what OP says. To me 'rewriting bits of it' means 'leaving most of it as is' which to me means leaving large chunks of text that is unoriginal to him in a story posted under his name. Which is where I get the aforementioned bad taste. I've never actually said 'don't do this' just said I find it distasteful and that I personally wouldn't because of my opinion on plagiarism.
