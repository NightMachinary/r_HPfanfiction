  As a writer I can't imagine even wanting to do this. I can't imagine not wanting something to be completely mine while throwing my name behind it
#+end_quote

That seems like a ridiculous amount of hypocrisy for someone that is a fanfic author. How is this any more or less lazy than taking Rowling's ideas?

  And lazy imitation does not strike me as flattery, it strikes me as trying to garner acclaim off of someone's work
#+end_quote

This is the least self-aware I have seen someone be in a long time. Are you serious about any of this stuff? Continuing off of Rowling's work is the height of artistic achievement, but continuing off of someone's fanfic idea, that's somehow horribly lazy?

#+begin_quote
  Not to really harp on OP as I know nothing at all about him/her. But this entire topic is completely irrelevant if he simply does that rather than worrying about some circlejerk about maybe maybe not plagiarism.
#+end_quote

But it isn't a meaningless gesture or just a circlejerk. As long as their concern about this is genuine (and I'd give them the benefit of the doubt that they are) it shows that they aren't interested in just trampling over someone else's creation. I think it's admirable to try to figure out how something like this will be perceived in the community.

  Whereas I would say the better course of action is to just rewrite everything and make it your own.
#+end_quote

I can't overstate enough how much it blows my mind that a fanfic author is saying stuff like this. You have 10 stories on ff.net and all of them are derivative of someone else's work. Why didn't you just rewrite everything and *made it your own*? What you're taking from Rowling is much more substantial than any fanfic could ever be and her work isn't even unfinished (which arguably makes it worse).
