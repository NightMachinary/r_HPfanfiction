Perhaps I'm not being clear enough with my points. My opinion as expressed above has to do entirely with plagiarism and not derivative works. You are getting dangerously close to the 'all work is derivative of something else' argument which does have a great deal of truth to it. But that's not where I want to go.

The 'story adoption' that I've seen involves direct plagiarism. I've even had people ask me to send them copies of my work so they could 'adopt it' and post it under their name. So when I see 'adoption' direct plagiarism comes to mind. And it is my opinion that plagiarism is the absolute laziest form of writing. So yes, I do find plagiarists to be lazy and find copying to be the lowest form of writing.

The distinction to me is put simplest as 'derivative work = peachy, plagiarism = bad'. Taking the direct copy of someone's work, regardless of permission, is still plagiarism. I've said my advice to OP would be to just not directly use the other author's work. Your examples try to apply my opinion on a plagiarized work to a derivative work, which I consider to be something completely different.

If you published the first three chapters of Limpieza de Sangre and then branched off into your own story, I would find it distasteful. If you were tow rite a story about a female Voldemort introduced to Harry Potter in the graveyard after the fourth task, I wish you the best of luck. It comes down to I don't like the direct usage and application of someone's work by another person. Is it hypocritical? I don't think so, at least no more so than being rude and then retorting about another's rudeness when called on it. You have every right to disagree.

Ironically, I'm guilty of it as is. I used direct passages from Goblet of Fire in Chapter...seven? of Letters. Does it matter that it was done out of love because I didn't think I could possibly write that short scene better than Rowling? No. Not really. It was still one of the laziest things I've ever done in my writing. And if I were to do it over, I would not make the same decision. Hindsight being 20/20 and what not.

I'd probably even advise the OP if it was something he wanted to do to simply say in the summary 'this work is a continuation of X by Y, please read that to have a better understand of this' and just not use any of Y's writing in his own. I don't care about continuing off of another fanfiction. I dislike the notion of using direct chunks of another author's work.

As for do I regret my work in fanfiction? Every. Single. Day. But that's an entirely different conversation. I will say I do believe my fanfiction is approaching it's use by date. So there's that.

As for it belonging to Rowling. It does not. Fanfiction/fan art 'belongs' to the artist until it violates commercial copyright. At that point, if Rowling so chose, she could either appropriate or destroy it. If she wanted to appropriate it, I could still decide to destroy it myself. Given that there's a bijillion copies on the internet this isn't a feasible solution. But fanworks are the 'property' of the creator until they aren't. Ironically, given that parody is protected, the objectively worse or intentionally bad it is, the easier it would be to call it a parody and retain it as fair use. But this is a slippery complicated legal slope filled with all sorts of potholes. Like, technically, if fanwork is the property of the original creator, The creator just does not have the commercial rights to it and as such can't do anything with it.

But anyway, if you don't see a difference between a plagiarized work and a derivative work in the same manner that I do, then we'll never agree. My opinion here and in the above posts was intended to deal directly more with plagiarism as I felt the OPs post came off a bit as saying 'should I plagiarize a story because it's old, I don't want to be a plagiarism scandal oh and I didn't get permission'. So my points were based around that.

Regardless, thanks for your time and have a pleasant evening if you're in a similar time zone to myself or day if you are not.
