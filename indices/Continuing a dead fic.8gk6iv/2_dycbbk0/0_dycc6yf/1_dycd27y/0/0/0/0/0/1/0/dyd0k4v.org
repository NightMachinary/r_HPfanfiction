  You are getting dangerously close to the 'all work is derivative of something else' argument which does have a great deal of truth to it. But that's not where I want to go.
#+end_quote

That's a bit of an obfuscation. We are not talking about vague kind of "Rowling is standing on the shoulders of giants" kind of "derivative". There's a very clear a->b correlation when it comes to fanfiction and I don't see much of a difference between writing a fanfiction off a fanfiction or writing a fanfiction off Rowling's books.

  The 'story adoption' that I've seen involves direct plagiarism.
#+end_quote

How could they? All story adoptions I've seen always make the origins of their story very clear. That's not plagiarism. I have the sneaking suspicion that your definition of plagiarism is wrong.

Plagiarism = taking credit for someone else's work without attribution.

This whole argument seems like a shifting of the goalposts to me, but I made a mistake by not addressing the plagiarism stuff earlier. I just didn't understand what you were going on about. When I was comparing "adoption of fanfiction" to "fanfiction" I was obviously working under the impression that we hold it to the same standards and it is done in the same way as fanfiction: Giving credit where credit is due and starting from the branching off point without posting another's work as your own. Of course it is lazy and bad taste to present someone else's work as your own, but the same holds true for someone who lifts parts from the books in their ff.net without marking them as quotes (and even then it's... iffy). It's not usual to post the preceeding chapters of OotP, even if your story starts right in the middle of that book, so why would it be acceptable for an adoption? [in any case that would just be a copyright violation and probably not plagiarism, more on that further below]

  Taking the direct copy of someone's work, regardless of permission, is still plagiarism
#+end_quote

Sneaking suspicion intensifies.

  I'd probably even advise the OP if it was something he wanted to do to simply say in the summary 'this work is a continuation of X by Y, please read that to have a better understand of this'
#+end_quote

Which is what I'd expect anyone who wants to adopt a story to do. Of course plagiarism is bad. Were you really under the impression that I was defending plagiarism?

To make things clear. There should always be clear attribution to the original creator(s). In the best case the original work should be referenced through a link. If however the adopted story is no longer available online it is still not plagiarism to post the original chapters as a reference (if they are clearly marked as a verbatim quote/reference). In the humanities it is quite common to quote large portions of other's work as long verbatim quotes: Not plagiarism.

If at some point the Harry Potter books weren't commercially available anymore I wouldn't consider it wrong to make digital copies available hand in hand with a fanfiction and wouldn't consider that to be plagiarism either (obviously that's never going to happen, just a thought experiment).

#+begin_quote
  But anyway, if you don't see a difference between a plagiarized work and a derivative work in the same manner that I do, then we'll never agree
#+end_quote

Of course I see a difference, but you seem to conflate plagiarism with copyright. I recommend Wikipedia to clear up any confusion: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism]]

The difference lies between a purely moral and a legal+moral (ethics depending on what exact kind of copyright violation takes place, commercial vs non-commercial, etc) issue.

For example ff2ebook currently has a complete version of your story in their archive:

[[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=the+pureblood+princess]]

Clearly this isn't plagiarism. It might be a copyright issue, because you or FF.net (not sure who would be responsible here) hasn't given them the right to republish your work, but the attribution and source make it clear that they are not taking credit for the work.

  If you published the first three chapters of Limpieza de Sangre and then branched off into your own story, I would find it distasteful. If you were tow rite a story about a female Voldemort introduced to Harry Potter in the graveyard after the fourth task, I wish you the best of luck. It comes down to I don't like the direct usage and application of someone's work by another person. Is it hypocritical? I don't think so
#+end_quote

Yes. Yes, it is. Why am I only allowed to write some kind of vague offshoot with a female Voldemort?

If I wanted to write my own version of the 4th chapter of your story I'd have as much or as little right to use your exact story with your exact female Voldemort and your exact plot-details as a branching off point as you have to use Harry, Hermione, Ron and their plot details. Asking you for permission would be more courtesy than you have offered JKR. If I for some reason decided to also republish your first three chapters it would be a scummy move (since they are still available at the original source) and potentially a copyright issue (you'd probably have a hard time suing me in court since you don't own Harry Potter and Rowling and her laywers would become quite upset with you). It still wouldn't be plagiarism as long as I didn't claim them to be my own creation.

I find it disturbing that you hold your own writing (as your "babies", which I can certainly understand) in such high regard and are so protective of them, but don't have a problem with perverting Rowling's babies in any way you want. I wonder how Rowling would feel about taking Voldemort and turning him into a girl?

Don't misunderstand: I'm playing devil's advocate here.

  Regardless, thanks for your time and have a pleasant evening if you're in a similar time zone to myself or day if you are not.
#+end_quote

Right back at ya.
