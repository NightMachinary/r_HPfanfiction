  I've never said you shouldn't be able to. I said I'd find it distasteful and lazy. You're taking my dislike for something as saying people shouldn't be able to do so. Which I have not said.

Now you're just splitting hairs. Obviously I wasn't expecting you to physically try to restrain/stop someone from doing so. But the fact that you dislike something, finding it to be lazy and distasteful, which you are doing yourself (without remorse) underlines your hypocrisy.

I'm not saying that you should feel bad about yourself btw. I'm encouraging you to make an effort to not find it distasteful when other people do it in order to resolve your intense cognitive dissonance on this subject.
