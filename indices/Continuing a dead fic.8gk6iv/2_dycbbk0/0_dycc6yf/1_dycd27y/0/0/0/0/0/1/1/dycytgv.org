  You are getting dangerously close to the 'all work is derivative of something else' argument
#+end_quote

That's not it (if one goes to that point, the argument becomes trivial). What I'm saying is that fanfiction is literally, definitionally, necessarily derivative of something else. What is the subreddit for? Fanfiction /of/ the Harry Potter series. So to me, when you said this and other similar statements:

#+begin_quote
  You're not doing yourself any service by taking from someone else. So the purist in me reacts with 'write your own damn fic and try to make it better than mine, don't just go for the easy way out and try to finish something already partially done'.
#+end_quote

It just seems ridiculous because it can only be done if you rewrite the entire series. Which of course is done by many people. But even then, they often use concepts lifted whole cloth from canon. You direct your ire at people lifting portions of text from the adopted story which is all fine and dandy, but that just seems irrelevant since OP seemed concerned with writing an ending to it, not copying and pasting everything and slapping their name on it. (Unless I misunderstood).
