  Don't ask for someone's opinion if you're only purpose is to formulate an argument about it.
#+end_quote

Please don't tell me what to do. That's incredibly rude. I'll react to your opinions how I see fit. I certainly didn't start this conversation expecting to find something so objectionable and IMHO flat-out ridiculous/wrong.

#+begin_quote
  I've already said in many other threads that I have a complicated opinion on the etiquette of fanfiction.
#+end_quote

I'm sorry that I didn't do thorough research on your opinions on this topic before engaging you in a casual conversation. Mea culpa.

#+begin_quote
  But you immediately went with the 'you can't be morally correct because you write fanfiction' when I'm not even talking about the moral aspect of it but rather the physical aspect of it.
#+end_quote

Call it what you will, but you clearly made moral judgments, calling authors who adopt fics "lazy" and it is evident from your tone that you consider them beneath you (for whatever reason, because they aren't doing real work, but you do, or something).

#+begin_quote
  At the end of the day my fanfictions are all mine in the sense that I thought of their plots, I planned them, I wrote them and I edited them.
#+end_quote

And people who write a continuation of a fic don't think of their plots, plan them, write them and edit them (assuming that they are giving a genuine effort)?

But in any case, you're both wrong if you think they are yours. None of it is yours. It's derivative and belongs to JKR.

#+begin_quote
  They each take about 800-1000 man hours of work and effort on my part
#+end_quote

Okay? Why do you automatically think writing a continuation of a fanfic doesn't require work? Why does your continuation of Rowlings work require effort, but continuation of a fanfic doesn't?

#+begin_quote
  If that's still not self-aware enough, well, I guess I'm okay with that
#+end_quote

It still sounds like a joke to me, to be honest, but I'm trying my damndest to take you seriously here.

#+begin_quote
  feel like at the end of the day whoever adopted a story would look back on the parts they didn't do and regret that they didn't do it
#+end_quote

Does that mean you regret your work in fanfiction? I still don't see the distinction. Lets take a concrete example: Your story "The Pureblood Princess" on ff.net builds entirely on the first five books written by Rowling. You didn't write any of that. You didn't do any of the work yourself. You didn't think of the plot-lines (poor little Wizard orphan Harry discovers magical world, has to fight an evil Dark Lord, etc. pp.), you didn't plan them out, you didn't write them and it took no effort on your part to simply take her ideas and build upon them. You're just taking the beginning of a story and continuing it how you see fit. And what's worse you have the gall to be upset about people who want to do the same to your stories. How is that not the height of hypocrisy?

#+begin_quote
  And I know that I'm considerably less proud of works where I've had to continue off things other people have done than things that I did.
#+end_quote

Again, this seems to apply to all of your work in fanfiction.

Also you're just projecting your own feelings. I doubt most FF authors feel the same or they would write exlusively original fiction instead of continuing off things other people have done. For some reason you only appear to express those feelings when someone else continues off your (or other FF authors) work, but not when you continue off of Rowling's work.

Please explain to me in simple terms: What is the distinction? Is it just the fact that you think of yourself as a good writer and those others are poor writers (because who would be so lazy and stupid to just take another person's story and continue from it)? I'm not trying to twist words, I just don't see how any of what you laid out here doesn't apply 1:1 to what you did to Rowling's writing. The only obvious difference being that Rowlings novels aren't fanfiction. Is it more reputable to take someone else's work if they are published? Maybe. Not sure how that relates to "learning how to write" and "putting in work". Both approaches (continuing off Rowling's work and continuing off another Fanfiction) seem to be equally applicable for those purposes. Is it a matter of scale? Do you think there's less substance to a adoption/continuation of a fanfiction? Does that mean you also consider short stories and one-shot fanfictions to be lazy?

It all sounds like a very weird kind of gatekeeping to me.
