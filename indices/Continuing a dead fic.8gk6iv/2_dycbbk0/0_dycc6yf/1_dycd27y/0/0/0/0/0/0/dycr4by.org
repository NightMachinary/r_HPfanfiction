What confuses me about this bit of the thread is the obvious point you already made, Deathcrow: fanfiction is already definitionally derivative. I mean, that much is in the term itself.

We even have terms to indicate how similar or different a work is from canon ("AU", "canon rehash", etc.) and even tropes that develop into fanon, which ends up birthing even further derivative works based on that because people like the idea.

I've not personally wanted to continue a dead fic for someone, but there is no real difference in inherent artistic merit in being n-th level derivative and n+1. The best one could argue is that doing so let's you be "lazier" since you didn't build up the prior stuff yourself... ok.
