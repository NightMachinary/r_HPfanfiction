Don't ask for someone's opinion if you're only purpose is to formulate an argument about it. I've already said in many other threads that I have a complicated opinion on the etiquette of fanfiction. I've also never called my fanfiction an artistic achievement and am on record of disliking most of it. But you immediately went with the 'you can't be morally correct because you write fanfiction' when I'm not even talking about the moral aspect of it but rather the physical aspect of it.

But you ignore that I literally say that I don't care if he writes a fanfic of a fanfic but my qualm comes with using specific portions of text written by someone else. Because that is plagiarism and I find plagiarism to be morally wrong and plagiarism leaves a very bad taste in my mouth.

There's a reason why in my first post I say copyright infringement and plagiarism are two different things. One is illegal. The other is not.

So you ask for my opinion about an incredibly complicated issue and then simply insult it and say I lack self awareness yet you can't differentiate between a derivative work and plagiarism?

I do think you are taking my usage of 'own' a little too literally when I mean it on more of a meta level, I guess. I write because I love to write. Writing Letters quite literally saved my life. Ironically part of my hatred for it now is because it reminds me of the twenty year old who thought taking a knife to his wrists was a good idea. And that I can't think of that story without remembering how that felt. And that since that same idiot put it on the internet, even if I wanted to delete it it would still be out there, I'd still get messages about it, and I'd still be reminded almost daily about that lovely December day in Chicago seven and a half years ago. But that's a digression that needs to go no further.

My usage of 'making it your own' is less about ownership and more about accomplishment. At the end of the day my fanfictions are all mine in the sense that I thought of their plots, I planned them, I wrote them and I edited them. They each take about 800-1000 man hours of work and effort on my part and when they're done everything I like about them I like because I did it, and everything I hate about them I can only blame myself for. The advice I've given people in the same situation of the OP to 'make it their own' is intended to be more of a 'do the work yourself, you'll be more proud of it that way' notion than anything else.

But I have a pretty unique experience set in that I've done a great deal of professional ghost writing. And I know that I dislike things where I didn't do all of the work on it a lot more than things where I did. And I know that I'm considerably less proud of works where I've had to continue off things other people have done than things that I did. And that working on those has always left a sour taste in my mouth. So the thought of doing it, even in fanfiction, leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Only OP would know if he/she would feel the same way.

If that's still not self-aware enough, well, I guess I'm okay with that. But your logic to me comes down to more 'fanfiction is already derivative do whatever you want with anything anyone has ever done'. You immediately went the more moral direction with it. I may not have been clear enough in my reasoning but it's far less about the morality behind it than it is about doing the work yourself. I feel like at the end of the day whoever adopted a story would look back on the parts they didn't do and regret that they didn't do it. And in fanfiction you're allowed to be completely derivative of someone elses's work so why not do so so you can write the whole thing?

I can only relate back to myself, but I started writing fanfiction because I needed an excuse to write. I wanted to improve my writing and I would say it has probably been successful. I don't think anyone would read the first chapter of Letters and the last chapter of Limpieza De Sangre and say Letters was better written, technically speaking. So I make the incorrect assumption that all fanfiction writers want to better their writing. My advice then, is write the whole thing. And that means I think people shouldn't adopt stories, because I think that's less likely to help them improve their writing. To me, using someone's work like that is sort of like making them exercise or eat for you. You're not going to get the same level of nourishment if you don't do it yourself.
