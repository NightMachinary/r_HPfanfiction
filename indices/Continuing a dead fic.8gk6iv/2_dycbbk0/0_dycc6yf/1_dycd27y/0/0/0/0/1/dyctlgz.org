Everyone is doing this for Rowling who ever writes a fanfiction. :( I don't see how there is even a discussion to be had about this because everyone's already doing it themselves. :( :( It would be very hypocritical for any fanfic author to turn around and tell someone off for doing to THEM what they're ALREADY DOING to Rowling.
