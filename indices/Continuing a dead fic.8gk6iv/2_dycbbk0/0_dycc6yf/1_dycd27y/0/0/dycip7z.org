Because I find it inherently lazy. And lazy imitation does not strike me as flattery, it strikes me as trying to garner acclaim off of someone's work. It strikes me as doing the barest of minimums.

The writer in me finds it on part with people who ask me to write their ideas, or post here saying 'oh i have great ideas I just can't write!' You're not doing yourself any service by taking from someone else. So the purist in me reacts with 'write your own damn fic and try to make it better than mine, don't just go for the easy way out and try to finish something already partially done'.

Now, I'm kind of an arrogant prick. Fanfiction wise I've written five completed fics totaling just under a million words and have written millions more across other realms. Every person who has asked me if they can 'pick up' one of my works has had no published works on their own profiles. Often, the people who are asking for something like this have absolutely no idea what it takes to write a story. And starting at a halfway point is just a disservice to them.

As a writer I can't imagine even wanting to do this. I can't imagine not wanting something to be completely mine while throwing my name behind it. Do I think I could write a fantastic ending for Grow Young With Me? Yes, easily. Do I think I should? Hell no, it's not mine. So when someone comes to me enthusiastic about something like this it instantly raises a red flag to me that they probably aren't serious about it. And given that I'm a little bit insane when it comes to planning and plotting a story (I have over 200 hand written pages for Tenebrae Vincunt, which has 1 9000 word chapter and will never have more) knowing that it's extremely unlikely that anyone else will put that much effort into my baby. And then, knowing that my name is going to be somehow associated with their work makes me cringe.

And then there's the simple fact that it's fanfiction. And that there is no real reason for them to just not write a similar story to whatever was abandoned, say it was inspired by the work of whomever it was, and then continue it however they want. Not doing that, to me, simply shows they aren't interested in putting forth the effort needed to write a story.

Not to really harp on OP as I know nothing at all about him/her. But this entire topic is completely irrelevant if he simply does that rather than worrying about some circlejerk about maybe maybe not plagiarism. Again, he's opening up the door simply by just not wanting to put forth the effort to write his version of what someone else has done. Whereas I would say the better course of action is to just rewrite everything and make it your own.
