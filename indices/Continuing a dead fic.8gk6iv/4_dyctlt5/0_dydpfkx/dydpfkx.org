Rowling is permitting it:

#+begin_quote
  "[Rowling's] concern would be to make sure that it remains a non-commercial activity to ensure fans are not exploited and it is not being published in the strict sense of traditional print publishing."

  [Her agent] said writers had to ensure that the stories were not obscene and were credited to the author and not to JK Rowling.

And when people "adopt" a fic, they often copy multiple chapters from the original fic - and no one does /that/ with books.

And while it may be hypocritical, it's still the author's right.
