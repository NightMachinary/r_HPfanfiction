This is always a tricky topic and is brought up every few months on [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] .

I would say make a real, genuine effort to reach out to the original writer. From there, it just depends on your own personal beliefs/fanfiction etiquette.

Personally, I would never pick up another writer's work where they left off. I wouldn't want someone doing that to one of my WIPs, so I just don't even bother thinking about it. I may ask if I can do a one shot or something like that inspired by their work, which I usually get permission for- as long as I clearly credit and link back to them. If I don't get a response I just don't do it.

There's a really delicate balance amongst writers of fanfiction, since we technically are already writing something based on someone else's work (as you may have seen from some of the other posts). It just depends on what you personally feel is best in this situation.

If you do end up going ahead with it, be sure to credit the heck out of it, with lots of links back to the original. Just be very open, honest, and humble about it. And save any emails or take screenshots of messages sent to the original writer so you can show you did indeed attempt to reach out to them incase anyone asks. If you post to FFN, I would also recommend reading through the rules to make sure you don't get reported. I know they're a bit more strict than say AO3.
