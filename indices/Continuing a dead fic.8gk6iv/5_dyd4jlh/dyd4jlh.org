You could argue that technically continuing an abandoned fic doesn't violate FF.net's plagiarism TOS. But you'd be walking a fine line and I suspect that, should the original author report it for plagiarism, even if you gave full credit where credit is due, your story would still be taken down.

So with that in mind I'd advise against writing a continuation of whatever story you're thinking about and just take the idea of the story and create your own story.
