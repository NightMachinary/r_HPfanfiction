Send the original Author a PM, explain your side, if they don't get back to you in 2 months go and post, make sure you give credit to the original author like you would the creator of the original piece of fiction in this case JK Rowling.

If the Author does get back to you and tells you to knock it off, +Tell them to kick rocks+ explain your side and perhaps alter the story enough to get them off your back
