I remember that Harry walked with a cane and has to be in the hospital wing after the war, he was then put on bed rest at the burrow when Ginny fell off her broom and he used wandless magic to stop her fall. I remember nothing from the description or specific oc names but I think that the girl Harry like basically looked after had black hair and purple eyes and her name has completely escaped my memory. ☹️
