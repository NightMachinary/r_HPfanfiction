"Harry, get up, hurry up, we don't have time to waste"

In front of his bed, there was a little red owl, which slowly took the form of a tired Hermione Granger.

"Hermione? What are you doing here?" Harry stood up almost instantly, only feeling a slight headache. "Besides, what are you talking about?"

Hermione took him by the shoulders, and a crackle echoed in Harry's ears as well as a powerful explosion coming from the house. It took him a moment to get his bearings, until he could see the Dursleys' home engulfed in a ball of crisp, black flames.

"Oh fuck, I was just in time." The tired girl fell to her knees for a moment, earning a confused and concerned look from Harry. "Harry ... There are things I haven't told you about myself, and you have to know, right now."

"Are you talking about 'Rotfang'?" The girl opened her eyes, and she looked at Harry in surprise. "There's a lot I haven't told you about myself either, Hermione, but for now, we must go to one of the hidden safe houses in London. How well you said, there is no time yo waste"
