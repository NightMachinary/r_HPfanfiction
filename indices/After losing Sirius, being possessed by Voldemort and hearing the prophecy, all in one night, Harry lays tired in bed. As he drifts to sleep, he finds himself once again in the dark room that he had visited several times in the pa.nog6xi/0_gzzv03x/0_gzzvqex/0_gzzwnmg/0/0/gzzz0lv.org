Hmm... Maybe

- Hermione is indeed a sleeper agent planted to Hogwarts in order to influence youth of magical society.
- She did influence Harry to wanting to be an auror on the off chance he won.
- She is a magical construct created from dead flesh of muggleborn children Grangers experimented on in order to create Heliophats.
- She feeds Dumbledore tartaric acid through Lemondrops in order to make him senile so he will be at most a figure head.
- She developed a crush on Harry and feared she will loose his friendship if he ever learned she killed the Lovegood spawn, directly going against her masters orders for the first time. She was disposed that summer because of her defiance and a New Hermione, almost identical but more Loyal to the cause of Rotfang conspiracy took her place in the sixth year.
