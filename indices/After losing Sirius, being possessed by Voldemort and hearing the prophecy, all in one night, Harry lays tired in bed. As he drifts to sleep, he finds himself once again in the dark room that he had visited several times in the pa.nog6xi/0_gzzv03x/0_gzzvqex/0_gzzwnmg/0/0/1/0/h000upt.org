Heliopaths are said to be fire spirits in the wiki...

Maybe we have already saw the Heliopaths. Maybe Crabble only used a simple incendio on the Room of requirements, creating a perfect habitat for Heliopaths. New Hermione saw this as a chance for field test of the creatures and discreetly released the batch she was carying on her beaded bag. Heliopaths grew fast and were able to destroy the diadem.

She lied when she said it was fiendfire, there is no such thing as fiendfire she made it up as a cover story. Heliopaths were later discarded as a failure since their ability to consume souls were unknown. A fake incantation for fiendfire was fabricated and a few phrases about it was sprinkled on rare books in order to authenticise it.
