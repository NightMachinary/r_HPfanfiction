This is AMAZING!!!

Mildly reminds me of the ending of linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/156561][Harry Potter and the Trademark Dispute]]), an insane omniverse crossover where, after Voldemort screws with a... happy... dream, Harry unleashes Hermione, resulting in Voldemort getting sued by what amounts to the union of supervillains over calling himself a Dark Lord without their permission. Ending involves Lex Luthor, who is natch one of the bigwigs, handing over the paperwork acknowledging that they will stay out of the British Isles for the next 100 years because Hermione won what amounts to a bet and so now has their blessing to conquer all of Britain without their interference or further involvement.
