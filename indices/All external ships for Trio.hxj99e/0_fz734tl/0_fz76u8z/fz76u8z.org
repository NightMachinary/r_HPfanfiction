I know about linkao3(18935341), but it seems to me it just replaces very common Ron bashing with Hermione bashing, I am not sure whether it is much improvement. I mean, yes, what Hermione did was wrong, but to make her into the worst person which ever walked the Earth (which I feel the story is doing) is a wee bit too much. We all were sixteen ones, and if there are no things you regret from the age of sixteen, it usually means you are not seventeen yet, I am afraid.
