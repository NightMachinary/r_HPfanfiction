Eleven years after the fall of Lord Voldemort, the children of the second wizarding war are starting their first year at Hogwarts. Kuro is an orphaned street urchin, raised as a servant by a death-eater and abandoned on the streets in Knockturn Alley. After an unfortunate run-in with a famous auror with a lightning scar, he is sent to join the collection of misfits headed to Hogwarts to start their magical education. ************************************************************************************************* This story follows several new students, including Teddy Lupin, through their first year at Hogwarts. It is meant to satisfy anyone looking for another Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in a canon compliant sequel to the original series, particularly those of a Hufflepuff persuasion.
