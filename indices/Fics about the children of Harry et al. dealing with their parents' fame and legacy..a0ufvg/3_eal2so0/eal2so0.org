The first little while of linkffn(3954448) deal with this, and it was the original premise of the fic. It extends beyond that, though, and ends up becoming a general "the life and times of the Weasleys and Potters." There are also prior fics that are part of the same universe if you want more background about some characters; everything written by the author is an epilogue-compliant universe that all ties together.
