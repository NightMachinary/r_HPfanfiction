I'd be wary of it being an overpowered Harry. You seem to think that Harry is stupid, but there's stupid and then there's stupid you know? Harry lacks pragmaticism, not brain cells. He goes off due to his moral code/emotions, which Hermione calls his 'saving people thing' which won't be fixed by an increase in IQ.
