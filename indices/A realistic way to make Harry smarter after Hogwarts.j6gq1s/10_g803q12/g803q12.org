as someone who had considerable issues with mind fog due to severe disabling chronic pain and other physical and mental issues, I honestly had this as my head canon already, as I know what it feels like when you feel like something is draining your very soul from your body. Thinking just doesn't work the same, responses to environmental stimuli and situations can be weird (I have a bad habit of grabbing mice or insects that I see in the middle of the night in a weird flinch reaction, so a snitch might be similar) and those basic things like executive function and motivation are really difficult.

It also effects things like that very healthy thing we have where our brain says ‘if you do that it's going to hurt a lot', or ‘you might die'. That impulse is sort of deadened or delayed because the process is muddled up and things like burning pain can seem like not as big a thing when you're already hurting in twelve places on your body and you need the cookies out of the oven.

Trauma and depression also affect pretty much everything I mentioned as well.

I hope that made sense, as I'm pretty foggy today; but mostly I'm just saying an emphatic yes. I'm not a scientist but as someone who has considerable drains on my faculties on the daily I feel like my experience leads me to think there is no possible way having a cursed shard of soul attached to you, onto top of the traumas he suffered as a baby and then growing up, that it wouldn't affect everything from his ability to process, things like ambition and self preservation, as well as physically and whatever it would have done to his magic and his soul.
