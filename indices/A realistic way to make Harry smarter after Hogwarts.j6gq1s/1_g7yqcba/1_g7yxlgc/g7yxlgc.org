It could be written like the Deadpool comics, where you see Deadpool speaking but there's also text boxes for his internal monologue and another voice he hears.

You'd have what Harry was actually saying out loud, what Harry was thinking, and the reaction thoughts and rants of the second Harry 'program'. With a strong writer, it could be a really fun read! Especially since Dumbledore has already set a precedence for Dark Lord-defeating wizards being eccentric lol
