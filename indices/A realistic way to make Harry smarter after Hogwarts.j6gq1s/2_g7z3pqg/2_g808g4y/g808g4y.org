Not necessarily dumb, but considering his parents he could have been slightly more academically brilliant. He does fine, but apart from doing well in defense (which isn't a real subject, just charms and care of magical creatures mashed into one class because care isnt mandatory and its mean to judge children on their self defense and their housework skills in one class) he doesn't show the same talent that his mother and father did. He could have been really good at something, even if it was divination.
