He learns the patronus charm - what else? He learns a couple of other spells -Expelliarmus (the disarming charm), Stupefy (the stunning spell otherwise known as the stupefying charm) Protego (the shield charm). Of the spells he knows, very few are considered difficult, really only the patronus is. DADA is just as I said it is, charms and Care, the reason that he beat Hermione (by only one grade mark) is the practical application and the opportunities that he has had to train the practical application. He doesn't need to be over powered, but having him actually excel at something, with passion, would be nice to see.
