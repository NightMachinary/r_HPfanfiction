Why do you consider Harry dumb? This is a legit question by the way. Harry (and Ron) might be teenage boys and hence prone to not taking work seriously but all indications place him above average.

He's not Hermione, I admit but then nobody is Hermione. Harry masters the Patronus as a 13 year old and as a 14 year old learns a dozen spells through self study for the triwizard tournament. He's also clever enough to adapt and get solutions based on his skills (first task).

Look at his marks for the OWLS, if you ignore History of Magic (where he seized) or Astronomy (which he spent looking at Hagrid's hut) the only bad grade he got was Divination and I mean - it's Divination.

He gets an EE in both potions and transfigurations, both terribly hard subjects and a Brilliant in DADA, something even Hermione can't get.

Harry is not "the brightest of his year" but he (and Ron) are very much above par.
