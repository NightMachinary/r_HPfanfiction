  He actually believes the poem and thinks that the hostages are really in danger, and ends up the last competitor out of water for it. Even Ron gets this one.

There is absolutely no reason for /anyone/ to believe that the hostages are /not in danger./ They were under a lake. There were no wizards around who could help them if anything went wrong. And unlike the other three champions, Harry has /personal/ experience with things going wrong and people nearly dying inside Hogwarts.

People always point at Dumbledore, saying that he'd ensured that the hostages would be safe. Yes, sure, just like he'd secured the Goblet of Fire so no one underage would be entered right? Like he'd turned up in time to save Hermione from the troll? Or Ginny from the basilisk? It's almost as if people believe him to be infallible.

That was Ron and Hermione there. He was /right/ not to leave them behind. Any radical merperson who was disgruntled with wizards could've stabbed them.
