I think that pinning Sirius' death on Harry is a bit unfair. First of, as soon as Sirius gave him the mirror he vowed to never use it, and did his best to forget about it. As for occlumency Snape (and Dumbledore) are as much at fault here as Harry is. Doesn't Dumbledore straight up admit it by saying that he never thought Snape's hatred for James would lead into him refusing to teach Harry?

Umbridge? "“Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.” it's the same thing as with Mad eye moody's Eye, Harry has NEVER been able to see injustice in front of him and not act. That's what makes him a hero. Could he slowly bind his time and come up with a plan? Sure, but then Harry's always willing to help the weak - He would have shown himself by releasing the ones on trial anyway.

Much due to bagman's bet he's actually rewarded for helping Gabrielle so that's not a sign of "dumbness" but rather "nobility".

And he didn't go to Lockhart for support, reassurance or even somenoe to have his back. At that point Harry was as sick of Lockhart as the teachers who just five minutes ago he saw mock him and try to push him into risking his life. It was revenge, not safekeeping.

As for Philosopher's Stone given that no one knows Voldemort has achieved flight until DH it's perfectly feasible that there is something to stop their path. Not that he could possibly know, I admit, but it wouldn't just be Harry that'd hit the stone, it'd be any non full body Voldemort and Snape wizard...

But then if you really want to paint the actions of a teenage, traumatised kid standing up for what's right - sacrificing his safety for others as stupid instead of noble I don't know what to tell you.
