  He actually believes the poem and thinks that the hostages are really in danger, and ends up the last competitor out of water for it. Even Ron gets this one.

Excuse me, Harry taking the poem at face value was actually intelligent. He's in a tournament. That was canceled for legitimate reasons. Made for *of age* magicals. Against his will. These same people thought it was a good idea to use *real* dragon eggs. You know the endangered species? Yeah. THEN! They thought it was a good idea to have the spectators stare at the lake/maze wall for two hours.

Yeah, him actually expecting the hostages to die is good common sense.
