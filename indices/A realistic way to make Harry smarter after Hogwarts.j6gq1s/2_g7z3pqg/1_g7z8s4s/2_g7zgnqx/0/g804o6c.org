I mean I would argue that the biggest true reason he's a bit stupid is that he's the imperfect narrator whose perspective needs to be super limited so the plot will unroll at the pacing Rowling wishes for. But there are definitely responses and decisions he makes that are wack. I much prefer it when a writer actually gives a reason for that like trauma, or having him as neurodivergent (which is another reason for taking a clue like that at face value)

Because Harry is pretty clueless in the books. Not stupid, but like, only quick when it moves the plot forwards, rather than being consistent or natural
