I always wonder if the majority of “hardcore” Harry Potter fans are also honor students in real life. AKA Hermione feels like the baseline standard because in real life the majority of super fans are taking honors classes and really care about school. So anyone less than Hermione seems lazy in comparison.\\
It would be interesting to know if there's any common thread between who's a super fan and who's not. Super fan to me is anyone obsessed enough to regularly read fanfics or engage in discussion boards etc. Just reading the books isn't enough for them.
