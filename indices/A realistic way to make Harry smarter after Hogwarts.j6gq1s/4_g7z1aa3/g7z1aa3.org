He always gets OK or decent grades despite the childhood trauma, lack of consistent parental figure and all the events of the books (being a child soldier essentially) getting in the way of his education. I don't think it is farfetched to say he could become academically minded/more driven after the events of the book. In reality, he would probably need therapy and some stability in his life to help him recover and then be able to focus on his education/career.
