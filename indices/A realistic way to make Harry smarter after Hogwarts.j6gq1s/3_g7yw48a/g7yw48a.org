During his school years, he was mostly focused on things other than school. There was always something going on, and he was always busy investigating it. Not to mention, that he was probably constantly stressed (competing in a deadly tournament, being fortunate by crazy dada prof, escaped convict on the run etc.), so he did not really have an opportunity to stop worrying and focus on his studies. Moreover, he found out about the prophecy during his fifth year. Did he know for sure that he is going to survive the battle with Voldemort? Probably not. He did not have much reason to aspire to become a healer, unspeakable etc., because he does not know if he will live to see that future. What he is focusing on is surviving. And he does survive. So, in a sense, he does achieve something.

There is also the fact that he spent most of his summers at Dursley's doing chores, which is not the most brain stimulating environment.

So, I think it is possible that after going back to school to complete 7th year, he would start studying harder, and maybe even find some hidden talent in arithmace or something.
