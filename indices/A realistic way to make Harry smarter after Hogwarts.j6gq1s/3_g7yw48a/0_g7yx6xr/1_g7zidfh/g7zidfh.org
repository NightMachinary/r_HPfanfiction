Speaking back against Umbridge isn't something I'd call stupid. There are things in life that you consider right, and having someone completely shit on them is beyond something you can stay silent on.

Imagine a black student being called a N***r by their professor on a regular basis. They'd lose their shit. As they should.

As for behaviour - making decisions is a matter of experience, not intelligence. Go back to book 1 and see how Hermione reacts to the devil's snare for an easy example. To get into some academic career requiring intelligence and vast knowledge you needn't be an omniscient, always right kind of person - you just need to be capable of learning the material. Which I'm pretty sure Harry would be, going by his graded in Owls (EE in potions after 6 years with Snape who had a hateboner for him to the point where he didn't really care about the subject? The kid's borderline genius).
