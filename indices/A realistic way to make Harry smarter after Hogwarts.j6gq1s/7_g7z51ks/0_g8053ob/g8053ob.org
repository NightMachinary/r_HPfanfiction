Maybe it is not a deliberate choice? He spent a lot of time locked up inside the tent and Grimmauld Place, with many books around and DE out for his head, if you are willing to up a little his stress levels (maybe having Ron and Hermione also extremely stressed and reacting to it in ways that put all three at odds with each other) you could reasonably make it so he turns into a stress-reader, making it so he /has/ to go back to Hogwarts for his seventh year and having deep traumatic reactions at seeing his home so damaged and the spots where he saw so many students dying (with an unhealthy side dose of guilt), making Ron and Hermione start to hang more among themselves (not as in not wanting to hang with Harry, but as them wanting some time alone now that they are dating), making him uncomfortable with the increased fame and then having him start using the stone to learn more magic (maybe he calls Dumbledore's ghost to ask for advice -either in life or academics- and it snowballs from there), having Ginny either get into a relationship with someone else during the war, putting great effort in her Quidditch career (talent alone only goes so far, training is very important and it could also become her coping mechanism eventually) or just plain dying (which could also have repercussions into Ron's interactions with Harry)... he would be pretty screwed up in the head by midway point, but he /would/ get to the genius level.
