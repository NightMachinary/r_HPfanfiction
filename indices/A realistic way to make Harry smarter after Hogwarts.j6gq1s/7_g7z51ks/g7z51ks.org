The soul part is interesting, but I always thought that Voldemort's soul actually made him stronger. He has two different souls, compared to rest of the humans, and his spells tend to have immense power behind them (in Astronomy Tower battle, his Impediment Jinx /lifted/ someone up rather than just slow them down, I'm sure you'll find more of such examples) which is really uncommon. Not only this but Voldemort's soul also grants him Parseltongue which is another ability that he otherwise wouldn't have. It sounds weird but I would imagine his magic would be slightly weaker than powerful once the second soul is gone.

The most realistic way is that Harry spent the Horcrux hunt reading books, which he didn't do in school.

You could also make him study by realising his mistake of not properly arming himself, given the amount of enemies he has, and after Voldemort, he doesn't want to get caught off-guard ever again so he tries to become the best wizard he could be.

There's also the Elder Wand, if he uses that wand then he could become powerful without even learning too much, or you could simply upgrade his Phoenix wand - I've read many stories where by reparing the Phoenix wand with Elder Wand, it somehow becomes more powerful than before.
