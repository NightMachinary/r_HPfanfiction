Harry is not a bookworm like Hermione but he is by no means stupid. We see him during his years of formation so he is still learning stuff but he has a good head on his shoulders. Other than the DoM fiasco he always puts two and two together. He is far superior in defensive magic even to students older than him. Despite being a child, he stands toe to toe with adults. He is in a way like Hermione because he knows his shit but he is emotional. Unlike Hermione though he also keeps his cool in critical situations. Sure, he might not be a prodigy like Dumbledore, Voldemort or Snape but they are in a league of their own. And maybe he would have been too if his mind wasn't always focused on survival unlike the other three. He is also very capable to catch things on the fly unlike Hermione. He is not a potion genius but he reacts well when Ron is poisoned. He sucks at summoning charms but when it becomes critical that he masters it, he does so quickly.
