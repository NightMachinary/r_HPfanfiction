This thinking of Harry should be smart because his parents are smart is bunked right? I mean that's just ignoring that nurture > nature right?

James was a pureblood who was spoiled, bullied kids at school and sexually harassed a girl until she said yes after 7 years of badgering her to go out with him. You know he was messing around with other girls with Sirius.

Lily was a first generation witch. What evidence do we have that she was just a genius prodigy? Slughorn said she was one of his favorites but lets be fair hes kinda a pervert and Lily probably looked great in a skirt bent over. Also she was great at charms and flitwick loved her but its not like she had any post hogwarts schooling like a mastery, or 1 on 1 master/apprentice work. She got preggo and was forced to stay away in a house to play mom.

Harry was brought up in a really messed up abusive environment. Its cannon that he ends up a semi normal kid even though his upbringing was terrible but no kid would honestly come out of that a functioning adult.

I think there is way more proof hes a messed up or should be messed up more than he should. His parents should mean nothing to him he didn't even know they existed. You don't get super powers passed down from your parents cause they scored a 0 on their charms owl exam. Dudley was a dumb box of rocks and harry was a physically/emotionally/under fed starved kid.
