  You could say that for that level of activity, the horcrux needed to use a part of Harry's mind, leaving him unable to use it. (Like a heavy, CPU intensive program running in the background.)

I would personally not present it so technically. I'd say that having someone else's soul in you is just overall detrimental to your well being. Similar to how Quirrel was doomed by Voldemort possessing him. Harry had less Voldemort, so it was less than lethal. There's also the whole Lily protection that you'd really think would have had some interaction with the horcrux.

I'd be interested in reading fics with this premise, but it's absolutely bait for shitty super Harry fics.

I'm a bit of a fan of the idea of Harry basically absorbing the bit of soul as a powerup. That also fits with the whole "the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal" thing and it fits the theme of the prophecy being self-fulfilling. Haven't found a fic that does it right in my eyes though.
