  I'm a bit of a fan of the idea of Harry basically absorbing the bit of soul as a powerup. That also fits with the whole "the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal" thing and it fits the theme of the prophecy being self-fulfilling. Haven't found a fic that does it right in my eyes though.

Fits the greek style prophecy vibe really well.

If I ever find something I'll post it.
