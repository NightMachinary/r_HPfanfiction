I'm also starting another one but it will be slow going. link(13216218)

Aside from self promotion the best Harry/Daphne I've ever read is probably linkffn(12155794) the pairing isn't really the main part of the story but it's an amazing read.

I also love linkffn(11022385) but it is unfinished. Probably my favourite characterization for Daphne I've ever read though.
