[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10728064/1/Days-to-Come][/Days to Come/]] is pretty good. The relationship forms fairly organically, which is always better than locking eyes and being instantly smitten.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12267737/1/Prince][/Prince/]] is really AU and resembles poetry more than an actual story. With that in mind though, it is still an enjoyable read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9774121/1/The-Legacy][/The Legacy/]] is a Marriage Contract story without a heavy emphasis on the actual contract. It is unnecessarily long, but otherwise a good read. Also, keep in mind that this story is the definition of /slow/ burn. They don't actually start dating until a couple hundred thousand words in.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12740667/1/The-Mind-Arts][/The Mind Arts/]] is a HarryxDaphne story, but doesn't actually focus on the relationship. They have barely started dating by the last update, so if you're looking for pure romance it's probably not for you.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/1/The-Pureblood-Princess][/The Pureblood Princess/]] is by far my favorite HarryxDaphne story. It reads like a slice of life from Daphne's POV and the relationship is really well done. They actually act like regular humans in this one.

Finally, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11185533/1/Uncle-Harry][/Uncle Harry/]] is a pretty good /what-if/. Short and sweet, it shows a married Harry and Daphne visiting Dudley's kids.
