what are you looking for? there is everything from cute fluffy one shots (standalone stories) of a perfect Christmas with the weasleys, to entire series rewrites millions of words long.

there are romances, action adventures, horrors, lighthearted stories, extremely dark ones.

there are tons of tropes that have developed (time travel, marriage law, overpowered harry, manipulative horrible dumbledore, etc).

i would maybe start with some shorter ones and see if anything catches your interest. i really prefer ao3 (archive of our own) because of the great tag and filter system.
