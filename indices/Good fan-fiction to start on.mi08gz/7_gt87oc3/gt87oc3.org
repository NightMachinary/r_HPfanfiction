I would suggest you start with linkao3(Sing a requiem) because you're entering a fandom where a lot of people (readers and authors alike) are blas√© about an orphaned teenager being manipulated into committing suicide. This story offers a different and far more healthy perspective.

The second story I would suggest is Linkffn(Stages of Hope) because it gives you a look into what will happen when adults sit back and teenagers are forced into fighting a war against actually competent villains. It's basically a realistic look into the horror of child soldiers in a way.

I know that these aren't exactly /light/ reading, but they're good stories.
