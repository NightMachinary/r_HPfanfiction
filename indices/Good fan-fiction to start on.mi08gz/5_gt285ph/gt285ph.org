If you're looking for light reads, check out Clell. Hiding in Plain Sight is a great place to start, imo, just be aware that a) it's a comedy and b) it's not canon compliant. At all.

For something more canon compliant, try Just A Random Tuesday. For a what-if scenario (canon divergent), you can't go wrong with For Lack of a Bezoar. Just be aware that it's... not all that light, honestly.
