You're probably not aware of the tropes or ships yet, but what part of the world interests you the most? Do you want it centered around Harry Potter and his buddies, and if so, at what age? Do you want to explore a different era like Marauders or Grindelwald or second generation? What genres do you like?

Something to keep in mind is that "AU" is alternate universe so, for example, a fic where Harry gets sorted into a different house in his first year would be an AU. "Canon divergent" is where the fic follows the books then veers off the path; for example, if Sirius survives in the Department of Mysteries, it would be considered canon divergent. Canon is strict adherence to the books. Do you have a hard preference for canon?

This will help people tailor their suggestions to what interests you specifically.
