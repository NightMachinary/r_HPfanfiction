I always suggest series by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] (start with linkao3(1615616) and go on), and stories by [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Mrs_Granger]] (Summer goes before Winter). My own first large HP story was linkao3(601124) and that's pretty good start as well.
