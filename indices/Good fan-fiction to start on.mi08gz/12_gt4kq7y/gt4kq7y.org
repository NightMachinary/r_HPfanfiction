They are kind of long, but they are lighter in tone and not too out there concept wise, so I'd recommend either of White Squirrels long fics. One is called The Accidental Animagus the other The Arithmancer. Or maybe the Innocent series by MauraderLover7. I also really like Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting by TendraelUmbra, but it's only just gotten to the end of year one and doesn't update super often. Really like the portrayal of Dumbledore though.
