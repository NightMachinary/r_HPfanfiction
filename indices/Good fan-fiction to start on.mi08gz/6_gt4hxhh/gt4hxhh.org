I would recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6872861/BrilliantLady][BrilliantLady's]] series. She has one on now that updates every Tuesday and Friday, so you'll get steady updates (the fic's finished by the way).

She also has several other stories, some of which are crossovers, of various natures. So you'll have something to read. Nothing overwhelming in her writing, so it should be smooth sailing.

I also second Northumbrian's fics, as you'll find plenty to read there.
