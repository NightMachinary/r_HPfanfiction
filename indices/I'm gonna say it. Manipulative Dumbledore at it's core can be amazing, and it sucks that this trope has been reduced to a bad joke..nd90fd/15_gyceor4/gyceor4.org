A truly manipulative Dumbledore would be terrifying and an incredibly hard feat to write.

I'm talking about decisions so subtle and apparently innocuous (even down to body-language and vocal inflections!) that it'd take years and teams of fans dissecting/evaluation his every move and action in the narrative to uncover it all, and even then they'd likely miss a lot.

Instead, we get him acting like he'd been hit in the head with a goat-shit covered shovel forty times.
