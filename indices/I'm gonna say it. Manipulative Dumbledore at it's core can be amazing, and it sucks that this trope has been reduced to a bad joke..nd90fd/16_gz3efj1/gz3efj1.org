" who doesn't shy away from lethal spells" you say.... You point out that he almost became partners with Grindelwad, and that he would be the one to understand the boundaries between good and evil. But you forget to point out that he preaches "forgiveness". The only time we see him act in a fashion that could be considered lethal is when dealing with Riddle, who he know he cannot kill.

Personally I think he's blinded by his desire for redemption so much that he tries to redeem everyone and if they don't follow his 'path' then they are in the wrong. But having lived as long as he has and amassed the power he has, he doesn't need to use force to convince them. While it often is over the top, the idea of Dumbledore using his authority to say "You are going dark" is still viable in the sense that he would try to use his position of power to guide and influence rather than use pure force.
