I'm honestly surprised that I haven't seen the 'Dumbledore corrupted by a cursed item' in a fic before I wrote it. In cannon, the Elder Wand basically got every user killed, Harry might have been the first to die a non-violent death. In my fic the Elder Wand was used by a Dark Lord several hundred years ago in a horcrux ritual, to disastrous effects. (It isn't a horcrux, but it /is/ manipulative and evil.) I mean, it's not like Albus had a perfect perfect reccord in cannon with dealing with cursed items after all.
