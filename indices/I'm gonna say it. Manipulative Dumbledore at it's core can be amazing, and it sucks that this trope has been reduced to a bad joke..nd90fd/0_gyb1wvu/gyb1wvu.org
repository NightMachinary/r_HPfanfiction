I'd love to see a story which does not present Harry finding out about Dumbledore's manipulation as a moment of triumph, but rather as a moment of absolute panic and fear.

Like can you imagine? Harry just finds out that this Wizarding powerhouse, a guy with 100 years of experience, a ruthless guy, has designs for him. Designs that aren't aligned with Harry's interests at all.

Harry should be terrified out of his mind and he should understand that this is a situation he can not come out on top in. No matter how many lordships he has.

I honestly don't even know how in the case of competent Dumbledore Harry can come out of this situation without his memory being wiped or worse.

Unless he turns for help to the only wizard Dumbledore ever feared...
