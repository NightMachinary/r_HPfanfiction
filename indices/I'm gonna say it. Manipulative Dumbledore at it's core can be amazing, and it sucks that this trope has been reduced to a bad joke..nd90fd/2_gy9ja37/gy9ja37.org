honestly what ruins most manipulator-dumbledore fanfics for me is this:

They say that he is this master-manipulator who has years of experience and nearly has the entire country in his grasp, with few exceptions and the exceptions are usually seen as undesired individuals who allied with Voldemort in the past.

And yet he is constantly fooled by some brat who just became interested in politics a week ago and took a starting-course in politics.

It is quite frankly idiotic how contradicting most authors are with their tropes. One minute the enemy is a master-planner and a serious threat, the next he is a bumbling fool who screams like a kid.
