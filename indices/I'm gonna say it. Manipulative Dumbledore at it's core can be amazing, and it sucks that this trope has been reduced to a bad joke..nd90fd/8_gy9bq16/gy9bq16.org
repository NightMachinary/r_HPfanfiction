That's how I am going to try to portray Dumbledore like, in my fic. Sure, he manipulated Harry, and certain things in his life, so that Harry would be willing to make the ultimate sacrifice.

But only if it would prove to be absolutely necessary. Dumbledore was extremely fond of Harry and proud of what he was growing up to be, and in my mind, Dumbles did absolutely everything he could to make certain Harry would survive, but he was wise enough to have a plan to fall back on, if all else failed.

The greater good, as it were. Sacrifice one, to save hundreds, perhaps even thousands. One might even say it's the moral thing to do.
