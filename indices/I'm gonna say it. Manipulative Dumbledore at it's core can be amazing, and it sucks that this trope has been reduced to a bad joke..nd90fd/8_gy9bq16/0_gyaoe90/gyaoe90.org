I wouldn't call what you describe "greater good" as much as "lesser evil". Loosely, the difference is that "greater good" is about maximising the overall balance between good and harm (as Dumbledore sees them); and "lesser evil" is minimising the overall harm, which still requires trade-offs because not all harms can be prevented, and reducing one harm may require increasing another. The latter is a much more passive and less effectual position than the former, but also less ethically risky.
