If one day, I find someone who can write a amazing, TRULY AMAZING, Manipulative Dumbledore, I would admire the said writer. It is very hard to understand how Albus thinks. To actually make a great fanfic portraying a manipulative headmaster, the writer would need to study Dumbledore's character for hours to finally know what he would do, how he would do it, by what means he would achieve his goals and what and who he would be willing to sacrifice.\\
