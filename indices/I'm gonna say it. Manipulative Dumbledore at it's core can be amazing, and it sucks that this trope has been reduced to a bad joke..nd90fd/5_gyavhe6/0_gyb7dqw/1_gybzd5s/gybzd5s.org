I like this idea. And plus..well until the diary. Yeah they were evil but. Voldi wasn't /back/ so to speak yet. Sure he was a shade..but look at Quirrel invited him in however that happened. .the curse on the DADA post was more effective at this point ... So there wasn't a reason Harry couldn't live his life naturally. I could see Dumbledore watching Harry to see if he would turn dark or get possessed by Voldi.

I know with the later books after 3 they like to convey that Dumbledore knew all along. But after 4, voldimart Is back and alive. Much more worrying.
