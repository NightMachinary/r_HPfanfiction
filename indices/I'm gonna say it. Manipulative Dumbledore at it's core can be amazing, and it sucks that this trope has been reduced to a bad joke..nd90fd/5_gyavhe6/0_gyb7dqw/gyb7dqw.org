I still believe Dumbledore only descoveres that riddle made horcrux after the diary was descovered.

In the magical world there must be more than one way to stop yourself from dying, Dumbledore didn't know which one Riddle had chosen.

So after Harry gave him the diary, he worked out that Riddle had used horcrux's. From then on he started looking for them.

This way Dumbledore hadn't been raising him to die, more just delaying his death.
