Yep, at its core its down to how well the author can write, story, pacing and characterization.

If they make Dumbledore a basic manipulate everything to the â€˜light side' one dimensional guy, its on the author. Im sure there is another author that can write almost the same plotline with 8x better characterization and decision making.

These stories with boring Dumbledore's give him such basic non subtle manipulation, dialogue and nonsense decision making.
