Harry Potter and the Ring of the Ancients portrays him like that. His true allegiance is revealed in a plot twist at the end. I should not post spoilers but since the story is no longer online it doesn't matter all that much. HE is basically forced to reveal his true nature because of a fuck up on his minions' side and he is so extremely powerful that Harry manages to escape him with some very quick thinking on his feet without making him or Dumbledore seem too ooc.
