I would imagine they Obliviate anyone they can catch witnessing the Dark Mark or other magic event. After the fact, if people are going around to newspapers and journalists swearing they saw something crazy, those Muggles would be easy to find and Obliviate as well.

As for the rest? It's not really a threat to wizardkind if some Muggle is quietly sure they saw something magical (or dare I say, paranormal?), but know they'd never be believed and keep it to themselves or only tell close friends/family who shrug their eccentricity off.

I remember a reference to a book called "Muggles Who Notice," I suspect the subject is explored there more in-depth!
