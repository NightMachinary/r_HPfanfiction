Well, I'm not sure but it seem's like they don't actually obliviate anyone. But here's my thoughts. Voldemort is pompous and a bit arrogant so it would seem he'd want to make muggles fear him and then kill them right? So his plan would be: conquering the wizarding world and killing all who oppose him, then he would reveal himself to the muggles who will think â€˜If he can beat people with literal magic, how will we stop him?' So then he'd kill all muggles and rule the world.

So in that case he'd wait until he had proof that he was that powerful, so that muggles would fear his existence, he then probably would have cast charms on the dark mark can not be seen by muggles.
