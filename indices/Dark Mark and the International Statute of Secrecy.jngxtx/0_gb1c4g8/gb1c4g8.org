Well, I feel like a giant rampaging through West Country in Britain was a bit more noticeable then a dark mark, and the Ministry of Magic did just fine covering that up. They did such a good job the Prime Minister was insulted at the notion that there wasn't a hurricane.

And it's even easier to pass off the Dark Mark as a fancy light-show or something than it is to cover up an entire giant attack.

Given the fact that satellite imagery and aerial photography was quite prevalent in the 1990s (see Google Earth records and google aerial photography) and the Statute is still intact (and will always be per JKR), it's clear that wizards have ways to change muggle records, electronics, etc.

So the Statute really wouldn't be impacted by the war. Obliviators might be a bit more busy than usual along with the Office of Misinformation but it wouldn't suddenly end or anything.
