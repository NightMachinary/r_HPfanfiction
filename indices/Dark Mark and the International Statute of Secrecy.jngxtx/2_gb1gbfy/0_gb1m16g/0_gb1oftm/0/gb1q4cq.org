IK, but I never mentioned anything about Malfoy Manor and I know that wealthy wizards could have owned the land that London was on back then, but the same could have been said for a wealthy muggle. In fact if a wizard owned land back then and muggles started building on it, it would be safe to say they were a pure-blood since it was forbidden to marry muggles in those times. Since they were pure-blood they'd probably murder all the muggles trying to build London.

Much more likely however is that a wealthy muggle royal decided that they're kingdom was not good enough: bought the land, had people build London, built Buckingham Palace and then moved in with his family, later on wizards were hunted for using magic and the remaining grouped together and used concealment charms to separate them from muggles for good and made their own little alley, from their they developed and built until they had an entire wizarding world.
