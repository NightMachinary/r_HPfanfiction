Malfoy manor is in Wiltshire not London. I'd say that any concealment charms over the grounds would be more akin to a fence than anything else.

Diagon Alley is in London, however I think it's a bit erroneous to assume that all that land is muggle-owned. It's not to great a stretch to assume wealthy wizards didn't own land in the capitol pre-statute.
