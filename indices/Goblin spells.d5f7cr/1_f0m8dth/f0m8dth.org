Goblins in canon can't apparate or sling curses the way wizards can, no. At least not without wands, they're second-class citizens.

Their magic seems to be limited to metalworking:

  "Well, goblins can do magic without wands," said Ron.

  "That is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wand-lore with other magical beings, they deny us the possibility of extending our powers!"

  "Well, goblins won't share any of their magic either," said Ron. "You won't tell us how to make swords and armor the way you do. Goblins know how to work metal in a way wizards have never-" - Deathly Hallows

The only fic I've read that spends much time dealing with goblin magic, that I can think of, is /Significant Digits/ - which is AU and a sequel to HPMOR. And honestly it spends more time on goblin politics than their magic, and even that isn't the main focus.
