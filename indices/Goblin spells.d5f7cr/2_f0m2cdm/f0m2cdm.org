One part of “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]]” series (aside from many other points, like that it is by far the best “Dudley's daughter is a witch”) is that it has very believable goblins. They are very non-human, slightly creepy, with their own (very distinct) magic. Highly recommended.
