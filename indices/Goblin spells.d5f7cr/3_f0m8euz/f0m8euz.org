I get into a bit of Goblin magic in Keystone Council, where one of the Harry Potters is goblin-raised. There, they use wandless magic, as one might expect. It's intended to be unobtrusive and subtle, lacking flashy offensive spells and relying more on touch.

For example, I have one spell that is essentially an ennervate but relies on the caster laying hands on the victim/patient. Another can pull information from a book and copy it out (used to prepare a bank statement from a master ledger).

The one I get the most use out of is a form of mage sight, cast with a hand gesture. Remember all those stories where the goblins see right through glamour's and whatnot? I figure this is how.

Offensively, my version of the goblins rely on weapons and armor, and focus their training on closing distance quickly and being a hard target. The idea is to take advantage of size differences as much as possible. Magic enhances these efforts (adding speed, etc) but is rarely the core of them.

Like I said, it's a minor element of the story, but something I had to think about during the writing. Linkffn(Harry Potter, et al, and the Keystone Council)
