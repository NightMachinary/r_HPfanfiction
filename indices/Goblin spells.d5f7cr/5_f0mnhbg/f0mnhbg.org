I always thought of the Goblins as only being able to cast magic through touch. Like inscribing Runes of Power into weapons, then charging them with magic when holding them. This is why the Wizards keep Goblins from using Wands, as the only reason why the Goblins haven't taken over the surface world is because they have no ranged capability beyond MAYBE crossbows. The wizards being able to keep any attacking Goblins at bay with ranged attacks is most probably the reason why every Goblin Rebellion has failed in the past
