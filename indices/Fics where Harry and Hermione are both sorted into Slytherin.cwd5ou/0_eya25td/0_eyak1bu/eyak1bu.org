I've looked at that before. While I enjoy a dark Harry and Hermione story as much as the next fellow, I can't past the idea of them actually being with a version of Voldemort. For one, would Harry really want to be with a guy would one day go on to murder his parents and send him to the Dursleys. So I think I'll give it a pass. Thanks for the suggestion though. :)
