You could try The Anti-Heroine. I don't think I'm allowed to link it tho, bc of underage stuff. The first half or so is great in my opinion and I love the concept, but I had to stop reading because there was just so much unnecessary sex going on and I didn't like skipping chunks of the story at a time. It starts out as Harmony and then turns into a three-way relationship with Harry/Hermione/Tom (diary!Tom). Not hate towards the author, it just wasn't my cup of tea. Maybe you'll like it tho. It's on AO3 you can just look it up.
