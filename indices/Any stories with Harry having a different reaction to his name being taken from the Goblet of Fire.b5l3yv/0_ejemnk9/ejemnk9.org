"The tournament is for Seventh Years only." Dumbledore continued.

The groaning and moaning of the younger students were drowned out when suddenly Harry Potter leaped to his feet with a wide grin on his face.

"Yes! Haha! Freedom! No death-stunts for the year! Wohoo! Frickin' jackpot!" He shouted gleefully, doing a spontaneous -- and somewhat peculiar -- dance of joy in the middle of the Great Hall.

The Great Hall became understandably silent as everyone turned to stare at the normally shy and withdrawn boy.

"No trolls! No gauntlet of doom! No homicidal professors! No basilisks! No evil spirit-sucking diaries! No Dementors! No stupid ministry verdicts! Hahaha! Peace and quiet! Finally!" Harry continued dancing, laughing and making random exclamations about why he was so happy.

Which was why now most of the Great Hall was gaping at him.

Sure, they'd known that the Boy-Who-Lived had gone off on an adventure or two, but the reserved boy didn't like talking about them, and despite his friends being somewhat more forthcoming with information, it was usually only the bare bones that made it out into the Hogwarts' infamous rumor-mill.

The fact that it was rather obvious from the boy's enthusiasm that he'd much rather have a peaceful year like what most of his classmates did, helped stem the potential disbelief over how truthful he was about exactly what his adventures had entailed.

As for the other schools, they didn't actually know who the strange boy in the middle of Gryffindor table was, or why he was so happy at the announcement of not being able to participate -- he was rather short for his age, his size being a closer match to a Second or Third Year's -- but they did know that normal students didn't consider basilisks and homicidal professors as something... well, normal.

Dumbledore himself was curiously considering just how far Harry's sanity had been pushed, and beginning to consciously admit to himself what the boy had actually experienced over his relatively short time at Hogwarts.

The realization of just how often the boy had been involved in dangerous situations, certainly didn't paint the school in the favorable light in regards to 'the safest place in Wizarding Britain', that it had so often been described as over the years.

Harry cheered as another one of the Champion was chosen, in part because it was fun to cheer for people, but mostly because he was still a little bit high on the thought that there wouldn't be any death-defying stunts for him this year.

It was making him cheerful enough that he'd nearly been willing to hug Malfoy, so yeah. Definitely high.

With the Third Champion chosen, everyone returned their attention to whatever it'd been that they were doing previously.

Only for the Goblet to lit up a fourth time.

Harry didn't so much startle, as he reacted.

"Aguamenti!" He yelled as he aimed his wand at the godforsaken Goblet that he just knew was trying to steal his hard-earned year of peace away from him. "Aguamenti, Aguamenti, Aguamenti!" He repeated himself, still aiming at the burning Goblet.

The Great Hall were once again treated to a most unusual behavior from the Golden Boy of Gryffindor as the boy continued to hit the Goblet of Fire with water-spells.

"I refuse! I won't let you take my year of peace away! It's mine! You can't have it! I worked hard for that! I survived Dementors and basilisks and even my bloody professors! I will have peace!" He shouted, sounding a little bit hysterical. "Aguamenti! Stop burning you ruddy thing! Aguamenti!"

Dumbledore, who'd briefly considered disarming the boy as he'd aimed his wand at the staff-table, was beginning to wonder if Harry might not be a tad bit emotionally unstable.
