"Harry Potter"

Dumbledore's voice was quiet, but carried clearly across the Great Hall. As the light inside the Goblet of Fire died out, heads swiveled to the Gryffindor table.

A thunderous look built up on Harry's face and he rose slowly to his feet.

He offered a single syllable: "No."

Dumbledore tried to respond. His mouth could barely open before Harry continued.

"I refuse. That's it, I'm done."

"Harry, why don't you come over to..." Dumbledore attempted to reply.

The anger built slowly, turning his face a light pink, "I said no and I /meant it/. I've had enough of the insanity of this place and I will no longer play along. I'm done.

"I'm out.

"I /refuse/."

Here, Crouch intervened. "I'm sorry, Mr. Potter, but the Goblet is an artifact of old magic. It cannot be denied, and refusing to participate will put you in breach of a binding magical contract. You'll likely lose your magic."

"Good."

"Excuse me?" Crouch answered. "But you'll be a squib! At your age, you even risk death!"

"Good. What has magic gotten me? What has this world given me? Time after time, I nearly die. Year after year, I'm subjected to near-death insanity, the hatred and fear of my classmates, and the magical world just dangles hope in front of me before snatching him," his voice broke slightly, "snatching it away."

"Bah! Don't exaggerate, boy!" Moody barked from the corner of the room.

"Exaggerate? Exaggerate?! FUCK YOU!" Harry's face darkened from pink to a deep red. Next to him, Hermione could see a vein starting to throb on his forehead, a mirror to his scar.

"My first year, I had to kill Professor Quirrel in self-defense! I had to deal with Hagrid's /fucking/ dragon egg! I had to, at the age of 11, get forced into the Forbidden Forest where I saw /Voldemort's/ ghost killing and /eating/ a *FUCKING UNICORN!*"

A deafening silence fell across the room. Everyone stopped, transfixed at the sight of the Boy-Who-Lived completely losing it.

"My second year, everyone hated me over something I couldn't control, Ginny Weasley got possessed by, guess fucking who, Voldemort, and I was helpless as one of my only two friends was petrified by a basilisk. And, oh yeah, I was nearly obliviated to death by Professor Lockhart, and wouldn't you know it, I once again nearly died because at the age of bloody 12 I had to go into the Chamber of Secrets and kill Slytherin's thousand year-old basilisk with a GODDAMN SWORD!"

Once again, Dumbledore looked like he wanted to intervene, but by this time Harry's ranting had built into an unstoppable storm. At some point in recounting his second year, he'd climbed onto the table without realizing it.

"And then...

"And THEN! Last year, I finally found out there's an adult out there who actually cares for me, who /wants/ me, my godfather Sirius Black..."

Gasps rippled through the crowd. Professor McGonagall interjected, "Mr. Potter, we all..."

"DON'T YOU DARE! DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE, MINERVA MCGONAGALL! I came to you for help and you did *nothing*." Spittle flew from Harry's lips. His eyes rolled wildly in his head.

"Sirius Black is innocent and the moron Minister for Magic did nothing! I had to watch as my other best friend got his leg broken by a werewolf /you/ hired," Harry pointed a trembling finger at Dumbledore. "We all nearly died to Professor Lupin. We all nearly died to the Dementors and if it wasn't for Hermione's time-turner and me driving off a hundred of those fucking /things/ with my Patronus, your precious Boy-Who-Lived would be a soulless /husk/ right now.

Harry's eyes roamed wildly across the hall, unseeing in their building madness. His body seemed to crackle with energy, his hair slowly starting to rise with static charge. Tremors ran across him, his lips peeled back from his teeth, and he continued, "I can't even go to a professional Quidditch match without a group of inbred Death Eaters showing up!!"

"And now this! THIS! A tournament that KILLS its participants and you fuckers treat it like light entertainment. A tournament that's only open to adults and somehow /you/ let me be dragged into this." On the word "you" the hatred and insanity leveled at Dumbledore made him gasp.

"SO FUCK YOU!" Harry's voice built into a hoarse scream, "FUCK EVERY LAST ONE OF YOU!"

The tremors turned to full shakes. The shaking built to convulsions. Blood leaked from the corners of Harry's eyes. A final gurgling yell ripped out, "I SAY *NO*!"

The complete silence was broken with the thunk of Harry's body hitting the table and the clatter of dishes and food scattered by his fall.

A heartbeat later, chaos erupted.

--------------

When he came to his senses, he found himself mildly surprised to be in a hospital bed he didn't recognize. He wasn't in Hogwart's hospital wing, and the larger, more professional-looking space had the feel of a real hospital. St. Mungo's, he supposed.

A nurse bustled over and starting nattering at him while casting charms. She asked questions. He ignored them.

Eventually, trying to break through his apathy, she barked at him, "But Mr. Potter! You're a squib!"

A slow exhalation escaped his mouth.

"Fine."

--------------

Over the next week, Harry had a near-endless stream of visitors. Healers he answered in monosyllables. Government officials he outright ignored. When Dumbledore came striding up to his bed, Harry cut him off before he could even start.

His voice, though tired, relentlessly pushed out venom: "Screw off. I'm not your student anymore. I will hear nothing you have to say. Keep a little of your dignity, at least a /little/, and leave before I have the healers make you leave."

Dumbledore must have seen /something/ in Harry's face. His eyes glistened with unshed tears. His shoulders sagged. Before Harry's very eyes, Dumbledore seemed to age decades, going from merely very old to downright ancient. The colorful robes flapped slightly as the Headmaster wordlessly turned and walked out.

--------------

At the end of the week, on his final day at St. Mungo's, Harry got his first visit from a reporter. A woman so hideously garish in appearance that it had to be a calculated insult to good sense and eyeballs everywhere.

She introduced herself as Rita something or other.

"Now Harry, you made a number of accusations during your little... outburst... at Hogwarts, and the world wants to know the real story."

He gave her a resigned smile.

"You know what? Fine.

"It all started when someone, probably Dumbledore, decided I should live with my Muggle Aunt and Uncle, who hated magic and hated me. For the first decade of my life I lived in a closet and was worked like a House Elf..."

--------------

When the story broke, it was all Wizarding Britain could talk about. The Triwizard Tournament itself was forgotten. The ongoing manhunt for Sirius Black was forgotten. "Boy-Who-Lived forced to live in cupboard under stairs by Muggle relatives!" wasn't just the top headline that day, it was the only headline anyone cared about.

One would be forgiven for thinking that would be the most shocking story The Daily Prophet would publish, that day's paper one of the most popular.

Until the next day. "Boy-Who-Lived nearly killed by professor!"

And the next day. "Boy-Who-Lived discovers Chamber of Secrets! Slays Slytherin's basilisk!"

Surely it could get no worse?! The British public was reeling with the revelation of Voldemort's real name and with the impossible tale of Harry's second year.

And then the bombshell: "Minister of Magic covers up Sirius Black's innocence!"

--------------

Meanwhile, in a small suburban home in a small suburban development, a small suburban woman and her small-hearted suburban husband listened to their nephew tell them that he'd finally lost his freakishness. He hated magic and the evil freaks who lived in the magic world. He just wanted to be a normal boy at a normal school with normal friends and do normal things like football and music and dating.

Two pairs of small, piggy eyes regarded him with consideration and, for the first time in the boy's life, the possibility of acceptance.

Eventually a sharp nod of approval sent many chins jiggling as the man briskly said, "well about time."

--------------

Investigations ground forward, the way investigations do.

Eventually Fudge found himself in the very prison that wrongfully held Black for so many years. "Dereliction of duty" and "fraud upon the Ancient and Noble House of Black" and "systematic corruption" were among the many words used, all of which added up to "we're really quite angry and /someone/ had bloody well end up in Azkaban over this mess."

Dumbledore managed the situation with rather more grace, losing only his positions at Hogwarts and in the Wizengamot. A little "local scandal" wasn't enough to depose him from his position at the ICW, although it did make his ongoing efforts regarding Tom Riddle quite a bit more difficult.

--------------

And years later, a happy, well-fed University student by the name of Harry Potter had found a girlfriend and built a simple, normal life for himself. He learned biology, played rugby, and had an old guitar in the corner of his dorm room that he'd "get around to learning to play some day."

When, on a bright sunny April day, his lifeless body was discovered in his small bedroom - without a mark on it - the coroner ruled his death a freak medical accident.
