Eh, I gotta sleep, but give me a day and I'll finish it.

Harry snapped alert when the file slammed atop his desk. A red file.

"Morning, Harry." Ron looked awful, like he'd been on Pepper-up all night and was starting to crash. Probably had.

"Damn, another one?" Harry had barely gotten 4 hours sleep after calling quits. The cases were piling up with this string of break-ins and they had all the former Death Eater business clogging up their work, even years later. The followers that survived were notoriously slippery, and the public was hesitant to go re-opening wounds. Very little had changed in the views of Wizards, despite all the effort Harry and his friends had put into changing society.

Harry took the file and started rifling through the menagerie of papers.

"Yup. Fourth one in twelve hours... That we know of." Ron was surprisingly nonplussed about the whole thing, but Harry knew it was eating at him. It ate at the whole department. Someone or someones had been ransacking homes in a string of burglaries without rhyme, reason, or apparent motive other than to take all their booze and potions supplies. The subsequent investigations turned up a lot of "less-than-legal" /accoutrements/ which harried the owners even further than having their medicine cabinets rifled through, which prompted complaints and more inter-department investigations. Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair.

"Anything new with this one?"

Ron beamed. "Oh, yeah. Plenty."

Harry raised an eyebrow. "Well? You expect me to read this thing or can you just tell me?"

Ron snickered. "Sorry, mate, it's the pepper-up. Think I'm coming down." Well, that confirmed that. "So, it's definitely one man."

"One person did all these heists?"

Ron put up a finger: "One /man/. It's definitely a man. We did tests with all the other break-ins when we got the call for this one. Magical signature is basically nonexistent. Had us completely perplexed." Harry knew most of this already. "But," Ron continued, "we got approval from accounting to hire a curse-breaker, had to be thorough and confirm our spells, so I called Bill up and he checked things out. It's a man, plus some magical creature, or creatures, and what's crazier is it is definitely the /same/ man at each site."

"You're kidding."

"Nope. One muggle, or maybe a squib, can't rightly tell them apart, is trashing houses to steal booze and drugs." Ron finished with an air of victory about him.

"Ron. That makes absolutely no sense."

"I know! Isn't it great!"

"Maybe we should bring this up to the Minister."

"Already did! Hermione is just as lost as we are!" Ron finished with a nod and a smile. Harry sighed again, rubbing his forehead.

"Ron, get some sleep. Your next shift is in..." Harry looked at the time. "Six hours. Christ. Go get some rest and I'll see you later, okay?"

"Thanks, mate. Read the file, it's... educational."

"I bet."
