Harry read the file and concluded the same thing everyone else had. It was impossible. Even the Unspeakables brought in were giddily excited about the new case. All eyewitness testimony could only be regarded as exaggerated and unreliable since their stories were so incredibly varied: some regarded the man as crazed; wearing nothing but knickers while threatening with knives and muggle "armfire" (Harry silently cursed wizards' general lack of awareness), found some of Hermione's notes fixing the nomenclature, while other reports noted the man was calm, methodical, fully clothed, non-threatening, but carried around a very large snake-thing and had decided not to risk their lives for their material goods. Many of the civilian reports noted how they didn't appreciate the Aurors "snooping" into things that didn't have to do with the break-in. "I told you what happened, why'd you gotta go and look down /there/?"

It made Harry sick. This isn't why he joined the Auror force. He wanted to protect people, make a difference, prevent another Voldemort from happening, and yet, the Wizarding world hardly learned a thing a from the war. Gave up nothing to continue going on being ignorant, thanks, in part to his sacrifice. Harry and his friends had lost so much... for what? For things to go back to the way they were?

The fact that this man had apparently burgled so many in such a short span of time was also mind-boggling. "A Drip Feed of Pepper-Up?" was noted in the reports in Hermione's careful script, only to be crossed out and replaced with "Amphetamines? Research."

Harry apparated close to one of the properties noted in the investigation. He'd been near enough before, during his Horcrux hunt, and quickly found the small, disused manor past the edge of Godric's Hollow. It was a small farmstead, usually accompanying and supplying horses, small cattle, chickens, and a handful of magical creatures. It reminded Harry of an upgraded Hagrid's hut if it had been nearer the countryside instead of adjacent to the Forbidden Forest. He tested the wards on the edge of the property line and found them amenable, almost welcoming, though they'd obviously been disturbed recently. Probably the other Aurors tramping around.

Harry shrugged and continued toward the main property, casting diagnostic spells and seeing the magical footprints of the past crystallize before him. There was an alarm, alert, and locking spells hastily broken, that much was clear. The door to a shed adjoining the property was ripped open like a giant had decided to pry it open. Some nearby sheep bayed in protest at Harry's presence.

"Auror business!" Harry announced, wand out. "Anyone inside, make yourself known or you will be met with force." Harry paused, heard no response, and shouldered himself inside the shed.

The inside was magically expanded to be a sort of combination barn, garage, workshop sort of deal. Several derelict muggle cars sat rusting amidst hay and old rotten grass. A wall of rusted tools and work benches covered nearly the full northern wall, while on the opposite end, stood feeding troughs and cages for animals. Dust covered everything.

"Hullo?!" Harry announced again. "Anyone here?" Harry cast another spell and made his way to a door that should lead to the main house, a door looking quite ordinary at first. Harry took a look at the door's lock and smiled.

"Hello, indeed." The lock had been /melted/ away. The perp didn't even have to use magic, he just carefully melted his way through the defenses. And the way the old wards of this place had almost /greeted/ him, it was no wonder this burglar was so successful. It didn't explain how he'd managed at other locations, but /this/ place was an easy target. Nearly abandoned, no one around to hear anything, and failing wards. It was a surprise to see it in such good condition: Harry would have assumed an abandoned magical manor like this would have all sorts of nasty creatures running amok, but it was almost tranquil with its surroundings.

"Hey! Boy!"

Harry spun, wand in hand, shield spell on his lips, when he locked eyes with the man who sneaked upon him.

Green eyes met hazel. Standing almost a head taller than him was a man, maybe twenty feet away. The man was armed with a pistol, bearing a shock of wild gray hair, wearing a brown jacket and jeans and heavy boots, and he seemed calm, understanding the situation. He had a wiry strength about him. Harry felt his nerves react and demand a response, but training and general exhaustion held him still. The pistol looked dangerous but pointed just off to Harry's side.

"You'd be dead if I wanted it, boy, lower the stick." The man motioned with the pistol.

Harry grimaced. "Not a chance."

"Then we've got a standoff. Negotiation, then. Who are you?" The man's bullish American accent was clear, but Harry couldn't place it beyond that.

"I'm the one with the stick, so I'll be asking the questions. Who are you?"

The man laughed. It was one of those genuine belly-laughs you can't fake. "Shit. You got balls, kid. Alright. Name's Rex. Your turn." The man's smile was missing a few key teeth and had a few too many points.

"Harry. What are you doing here?"

"Following you." The man's smile persisted. Like a still image.

"Why?"

"To see what you're up to?"

Harry relaxed a bit, but just a bit. Usually, if you got someone talking, they wanted to keep talking. People liked to talk about themselves. Hermione quoted some muggle psychology about it all the time in her negotiation practices. "Someone's been breaking into homes. I'm police, here to investigate. Put down the gun."

"Only if you put away the stick."

"It's just a stick."

The man smiled again. "And my dick is made of gold. Kid, I know what you are and you aren't as clever as you seem. Your magic don't work on me."

That gave Harry pause. Was this some sort of new threat? A muggle-lead counter to all the horrible things magic had done to the world?

"Explain."

"Nope. /Skiiiiinks! Heeeeere!/" The man, well, hissed. A half-snake half-iguana type creature scurried into view. It was blueish-green with stripes of bright orange, bright blue flanges on its head and deadly yellow eyes, and had to be close to 40 stone. It was huge, not basilisk-sized, but a big fucking reptile. Or amphibian. Harry didn't quite know the difference and wasn't keen on finding out.

Harry started casting before the creature came into full view. It /HISSSSSED/ and a sort of sonic force pierced through his various protections, sending him reeling. And nauseous. And confused. The creature flicked its tongue at Harry with another /HISSSSS/ and Harry was buffeted with another round of energy. On the ground, barely coherent, but still gripping his wand, Harry slung spells at random to ward off the offending creature and its human master.

"Not gonna work!" a voice said.

"It's scent is familiar," another voice said. "Can we taste it?"

"Nah," said the first voice. "I think this one's special. Never know with these magic types."

There was a hissing groaning noise. "/Hmmm./ You always say that."

"And I'm always right."

Harry tried to move, to interject, to do anything, but he got hit with another hissing spell and saw only blackness.
