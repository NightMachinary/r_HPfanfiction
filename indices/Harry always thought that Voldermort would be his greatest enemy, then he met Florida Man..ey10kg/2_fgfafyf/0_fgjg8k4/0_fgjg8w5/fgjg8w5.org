Harry woke covered in cold water.

"'Bout time. I was getting worried! Not getting enough sleep there?"

"Who'se a what'snow?" Harry felt the slap about 2 seconds after it impacted his face.

"Wakey wakey wizard. Time to cough up. Who are you exactly?"

"Wha?" Harry was tied to a chair, and slowly the room came into view. Some sort of basement; the walls were bare concrete and illuminated by a few electric lights, though Harry couldn't see their source.

"You stepped onto my family property without a moment's hesitation, started your investigation, and none of my alarms went off. Skinks here won't even erase your memory. Now, we can do this easy way, or we can do it the fun way. Who are you?"

"Harry."

"Hardy Har. WHO?" Harry felt the backhand immediately this time. "ARE YOU?" The man leveled the pistol at Harry's eye level. Harry almost laughed.

"You don't know?"

"What, is it some sort of joke?"

"I'm Harry /fucking/ Potter, you idiot."

"Bullshit. Potters are dead," he said, keeping the gun level.

"Not this one," Harry exhaled some blood out of his nose. "Although, there was that time where I was, but wasn't. Kind of confusing when you look back on it."

"Hmmm." The man lowered the gun, but still seemed skeptical. "Potter? Harry Potter? Who were your parents?"

"James and Lily. Everyone knows that."

"James... James Potter..." The man tried recalling, and Harry reached out with his magic, see if he could find his wand, or anything that might help him. He didn't detect his wand, but he did sense the snake... thing, nearby, curled up next to a vent, no doubt a heat source.

"They'll be looking for me, you know." Harry tried to break the man's reverie.

"Can't recall a James," the man ignored Harry. "Though I didn't get all the info from you Brits when the last of the lines kicked the bucket." Harry was just as confused as ever. If he could get the lizard on his side, it might help. He reached out with his magic again, a bit more confident this time, now that he was waking up.

"Tell me," Harry said, hoping for a distraction. "What is Rex short for?" Harry had just remembered that little tidbit.

"None of your business." The man's attention was back on Harry instead of wistfully recalling something. The gun reentered Harry's view. "What do you mean they'll be looking for you?"

"I'm famous, you know."

"Oh? Really? What for?"

"Killing Tom Riddle, mostly. Twice."

The man looked perplexed, but then shrugged. "What do you say, Skinks? Is this one a lost cause? Wanna eat 'im?"

"Snnnnoooot eeeeeat," Harry hissed. His Parseltongue was incredibly rusty, and it was hard to just, well, speak it, without a snake or something in front of him.

"Shit," the man said.

"Shiiiiiit," Skinks said.

--------------

"Gaunts had a squib line in the Americas?"

"Yup. Changed their name, started Ilvermorny, actually."

Harry and the man were in the kitchen now. They'd agreed to talk, in regular human speak, after several tense moments of trying to get /Skinks/ to obey each other. Harry still didn't have his wand, but Rex agreed to stow his pistol, for now.

"Slytherin's line, I think, made it to America. It's how I got this /ssssssneaky ssssskill/. But!" The man put up a finger, "I got a message saying everyone with magic in the family had died off. So I came to this side of the pond and see if I could clean up and take what's mine."

"Hold on." Harry rubbed his head. This was all getting a little confusing. "That has to be a massive number of families. I'm related to half of wizarding Britain if you go back far enough. How did you find this out? How are you doing these robberies?"

"You're right, it is a big number, but I'm going through the properties one by one. Was on a roll until you showed up. Skinks is leading the way."

"What the hell is Skinks, anyway?"

"Ssssomething old. Ssssomething dangerous," Skinks hissed from its windowsill perch. Another of Slytherin's pets, then?

"Look, I'm obviously not dead, and while this has been very enlightening, I can't just let it slide. I'm an Auror."

"I know, but you /should/ be dead. That isn't a threat, I got a magical whats-a-hoosit that told me." The man produced an old looking pocket watch with too many hands on the dial. He showed it to Harry.

It was like a miniature version of the Weasley clock, except the edges were inscribed with "Peverell," "Gaunt," "Sayre," and "Potter." The hands were all dangling idle, as if the mechanism had died. An inscription at the top said /In domo mortis/ and then the rest was scratched off.

"I'd been waiting," Rex explained, "for everyone to die off. Just biding my time, me and Skinks, seeing the hands drop off one by one. And then they did, and I came here to take back a fortune, and, well, things aren't going as I planned."

"I'll say. For one, I'm /not/ dead, and you really don't follow the news, do you?"

The man shrugged. "Figured that dark lord of yours finally did everyone in, seeing as how all the hands died off."

"That dark lord was Tom Riddle, AKA 'Voldemort,' and he was a Gaunt."

"Oh."

"And I'm a Potter, and I killed him, but not before he killed me."

"Huh?"

"It's complicated."

There was a pregnant silence as the two took everything in. Harry could really use a spot of tea and a nap, but he'd really like his wand back. The department was going to absolutely /love/ this, if they ever figured the connection out. Harry's yank cousin who lived in a swamp by the looks of it, with a pet snake that seemed like some bastard version of a Basilisk mixed with whatever they had in Florida.

"I've got an idea," Rex finally said. "How about you don't tell your friends in law enforcement about this?"

"Oh?"

"And I let you /live/," Rex added, leaning forward.

"Kind of looks like you need me." Harry added, almost regretting the words as they left his mouth. Once he'd said them, though, an idea formed in his mind.

"Is that so? Seems I've been doing just fine until /you/ showed up."

"Yeah, about that, do you realize how much shit you've stirred up? Everyone is distracted, looking for you, and we've got a lot of loose ends to tie up with Voldemort, still."

"So?"

"So," Harry couldn't believe he was doing this. "So, you and me, we team up. Cousin."

"Hmmm." Rex looked thoughtful for a moment. "Done." The pistol reappeared in Rex's hand.

Harry rolled his eyes. "Put that ridiculous thing away, it won't do much anyway."

"Gonna disagree with you there, bucko."

"It's cousin."

"'Kay, Partner."

Ugh. Harry was going to regret this.
