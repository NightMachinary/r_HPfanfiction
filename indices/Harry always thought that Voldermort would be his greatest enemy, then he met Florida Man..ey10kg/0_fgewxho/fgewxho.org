All I can see is naked greased up meth guy running through diagon alley with a tire iron smashing stuff. He's not a wizard, he's just got drunken master coordination and luck.

He took out 2 bars and a convenience store, before finding himself in the leaky cauldron.

Another smashed up bar, a smashed brick wall and greased up naked meth guy finds himself in diagon alley in yet another sensory overload.

He gives Fortescue a black eye, pisses in the ice cream, and exits through the shop window after auror Potter shows up.

Harry chases him into knockturn alley, where greased up naked meth guy causes all sorts or chaotic destruction, good and bad.

In the end, he exits knockturn alley through a brick wall in a brothel, emerging into a Tesco, and continues his flight of destruction.

The chase continues, never really reaching the beyond the bounds of 'highly implausible', but getting well into 'impossible' territory through the sheer number near misses and amount of destruction caused.

The time span of the fic wouldn't be more than like half an hour, just constant action and chaos. You'd be exhausted by the time you're done with it because no one should be able to go quite that hard for more than like 8 minutes.

But he's on meth. And he's greased up. He can't stop. He won't stop. He'll do whatever he wants. Like fucking the Minister of Magic's hat while sprinting through an human trafficking operation, clumsily roundhouse kicking everyone he comes across.
