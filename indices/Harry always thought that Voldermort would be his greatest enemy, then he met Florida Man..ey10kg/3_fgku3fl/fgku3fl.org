And by greatest enemy, I mean annoying.

Can you imagine spending weeks following around suspects, gathering evidence, preparing his case. And right when he is about to make his arrest, IN COMES FLORIDA MAN! And knifes the suspect. Every. Single. Suspect. This week he knifed one. The week after, he shot him. A month later, Florida Man's meth lab exploded and got the suspect. And he can't capture him either, as he's a muggle. Stupid Laws. Screw being an Auror, Professional Quidditch is where it's at, there's no muggles there.
