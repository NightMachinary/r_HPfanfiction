I have a hiatus story where harry asks "what if a phoenix sat on a dragon's egg like a toad on a chicken's egg?" and it results in a faerie dragon with ornate feathered butterflyesque wings about the size of a person. They'd end up being a high-status pet.

I may add them to my sttng/hp story or my darkness!harry story if I ever figure out a reason to add them. I really loved the idea of them and want to but they have to be plot relevant.
