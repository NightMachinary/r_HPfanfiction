There are no bad ideas, only bad execution.

One of the interesting things about writing fanfiction is that you don't need to justify your decisions. While the characters and the canon belong to another, the story you write is wholly yours. Make Neville the third in the trio if that's your aim; there's no need to bash Ron to achieve this, just make a storyline where Neville's inclusion is consistent and believable. If your fic is a crossover with Dr Who, then write it well enough and the reviews will come. Write it badly and your fic will sink into obscurity.

Any villain can be redeemed, and Draco is no exception. There are stages to redemption: the self-realisation that what the one is doing is wrong, guilt, self-introspection, remorse, acceptance, compensation / aid to former enemies / self-sacrifice. I would personally be interested in a well-written fic that has Draco's redemption as the major sub-plot, even though he's not a favoured character for me.

Ideas are easy, writing is hard. Above all, write for yourself and have fun. Send me a PM when you get your first chapter out. :)
