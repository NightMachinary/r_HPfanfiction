First and foremost, you need to first figure it what story you are trying to tell. Who is the story about? What is the conflict? You want to make sure you aren't just regurgitating the canon story with a trio change.

If you want to make Neville part of the trio in 2nd/3rd year, you don't have to write a reason for Ron not being there. It could just be that Harry sat with Neville and Hermione on the train rather than Ron first year and he became friends with him instead of Ron. Maybe make Ron be good friends with Seamus and that could make a plausible change.

Now for the other portions. So my advice is to pick a coupe of these ideas, and throw out the others. You are trying to do too much with one story. If you want to do a Draco redemption, he needs to be a large focus of the story and it would have to be long (simply because you would have to make the change gradual). For a redemption, you have to show Draco figuring out his worldview is messed up, struggle to get over the prejudices written into his personality, and make it believable. You want to avoid the “leather pants Draco trope”. It sounds like your focus is the trio, so a Draco redemption where I'm he is not the MC is doable, but extremely difficult to deal believably. It might be worth doing a second fic if this is something you truly want to do.

Now for the weeping angels. Unless you are bringing other elements of Doctor Who into this, I would abandon that plan completely because you are simply trying to find an easy solution to a complex problem. It's kind of lazy to just bring one element of another show in to fix a possible plot hole.

Good luck and welcome ! Hope your story goes well!
