Sounds cool!

And never worry if the idea has been done before because you will always bring something new to it!

It sounds like you are taking in a large story for your first go, so I would like to give you just a tie but if advice I wish I would have been told early on (been writing fanfic for 11 years). Just some things that tend to happen with new fanfic writers so I hope I'm not overstepping.

- Outline outline outline. You done have to stick to it if the story naturally deviates, but it is a lot easier to not hit a road block if you have the bare bones planned out. Also helps you not burn out.

- write a good summary and don't include any self bashing in your notes or summary

- Avoid epithets like the plague.

- Get a beta if you can. They will help you develope as a writer more than you can know. They can help with continuity, characterization, and grammar that a writer can easily miss.

- Don't over describe things. No one likes a paragraph of description of someone's outfit that doesn't advance the plot.

- Always remember to show not tell if you can help it.

I'm excited for you to start this. Let us know if you end up posting it!
