Well I didn't exactly give out the full plot for fear of people stealing it but basically I'm fixing all the things that bugged me about the series while adding in things I think would be cool if it happened. It'll start out with Harry, Hermione and Neville as the trio but Draco will become part of it later and they will all become animagus and reform the next generation of marauders. I know that at least is probably cliche but I really like the idea. But the main plot is that Voldemort finds a way to recreate the philosophers stone and comes back to life that way, and there are no horcruxes. So they have to find a different way to destroy him and the war happens much sooner than fourth year. The only problem with them befriending Neville on the train instead is then I would have to rewrite the first two books in order for the rest of story to make sense. I still want the events of the first two years to go mostly the same. I also considered making Draco a werewolf, but that's a cliche also. It's so hard to find non cliche original ideas for stories.

Thanks for your advice!
