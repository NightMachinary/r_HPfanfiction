Wow! I really love the idea about Draco, I think I'll go ahead and use it. I was planning on giving him a little sister who befriends a muggleborn to help him with his prejudice by seeing what â€˜mudbloods' are really like which should also help.

I can't have the Weasleys removed from Hogwarts however, because Ginny is going to end up with Neville and play a bigger role than she does in the books. I may just have to kill Ron off, since I really don't want to bash him but need him out of the story.

Thanks for the tips!
