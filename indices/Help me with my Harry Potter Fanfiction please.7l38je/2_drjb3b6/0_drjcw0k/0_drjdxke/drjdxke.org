If you want to kill Ron you can do that, but it will be hard to write how the characters deal with him being dead because how young they are and you still have a plot for them to deal with.

Another simple way would be to give Ron a girlfriend( it doesn't really matter who) and have him spend a lot of time with her and her friends, Harry being bored without Rons starts spending more time with Neville and maybe Ginny. And over a short time Harry and Ron would be a less closer because they start develop their own circles of friends and only barely spend any time together. So you could simply have them remain friends but in asimilar way Harry and Ron were friends with Neville in canon prior to the fight in the ministry. Like they would still occasionally talk with each other, maybe sit in the same compartment in the train and still offer each other support.
