I like that idea much better. I'm really averse to killing off main characters especially kids. This has been the hardest part to figure out in my fanfic because I really wanted Ron out of the picture. I've read so many Harmony fics that bash him and he acts ooc. I wanted to do something different. I tried to find a way he could unintentionally betray them but that probably counts as bashing and I wouldn't know how to do that. But him being friends with Dean and Seamus always made more sense anyway. For someone who is constantly overshadowed by others, befriending the boy who lived wasn't really the best choice.

Thank you so much for the idea!
