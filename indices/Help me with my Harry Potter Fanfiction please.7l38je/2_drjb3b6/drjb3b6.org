if you want to remove Ron without bashing you could simply have his parents remove him and his siblings from Hogwarts. Think about it, They just almost lost Ginny because of Voldemort and now his most devoted follower Sirius Black escaped, and because he is targeting Hogwarts more than a hundred Dementors are stationed their. Considering they just won a decent amount of money you could simply have them use it to place their children at some other magic school to ensure that they do not risk losing another child again. But you would have to adapt Sirius behavior accordingly.

If you want to redeem Draco a easy way to do it would be having his father be arrested for what happens in Hogwarts and owning Dark objects. When Ron and Harry pretended to be Crabbe and Goyle they found out that the Malfoy have a secret chamber filled with objects of the dark arts hidden under their drawing room. Ron said he wanted to write his father about it, but we never found out what happend. You could simply have them find Dark objects there, the Aurors connect it to the chamber incident he is arrested. And like in Half-Blood Prince Draco finds out that many People dont want to associate with him because his fathers fall from grace. Him becoming a pariah because he doesn't have anything to going for him except the influence of his family they just lost can be used to explain character development.
