All of the archives noted here: [[http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=FanFiction.Net]]

Also looked through Portkey and Portkey archives like [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/]] and also one that I downloaded awhile ago; though to be fair I didn't expect anything because I don't think the author was ever on Portkey.

Also tried the way back machine which didn't have anything on FFnet.

And as a last Hail Mary I'm downloading another archive I found on this sub, but I don't think it'll have it either.
