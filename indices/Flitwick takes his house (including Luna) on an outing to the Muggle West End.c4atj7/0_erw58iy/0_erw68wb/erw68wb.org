Whose genius? It would have to be someone who was connected enough with the muggle world to understand that such a time period and such a scheme could be passed off as a theater group creating an interactive art piece. The person who came up with the scheme would have to understand the concept of "interactive art piece", as the muggles understood it, and also the muggle perceptions and conceptions of the Victorian period. Who, in all of Hogwarts, would have this understanding? Perhaps Charity Burbage (assuming this takes place before July, 1997) could also act as a guide for this trip.
