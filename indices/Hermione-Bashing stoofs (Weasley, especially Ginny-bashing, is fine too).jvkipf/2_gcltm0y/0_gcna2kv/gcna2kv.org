That fanfic is so weird and nonsensical. It bashes canon Hermione for not taking opportunities that are only available in this AU. When was it said that bluebell flames indicated an affinity for flames? Why would Sleekeazy's exist if every schoolgirl knew about a charm that would fix her hair? Hermione was also the first person to ever get a time turner, but this fanfic has many people receiving it.
