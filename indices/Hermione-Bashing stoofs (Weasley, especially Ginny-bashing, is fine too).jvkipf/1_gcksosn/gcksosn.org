I love a good bashing fic. I don't even have a preference for who gets bashed, honestly; if it's well written and compelling then I'm down for it! That being said, a good fic that isn't quite Hermione bashing, but definitely a "Hermione isn't infallible and faces consequences like anyone else would in the real world" type story that I love is golden bullets.

I'm going to follow this because bashing fics are my guilty/not so guilty pleasure.

Edited to fix the link... I hope lol
