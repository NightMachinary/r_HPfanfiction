I think there's a difference between bashing a character in a fic for fun and to explore new concepts, and bashing a character because that's what you truly believe they are like, inside and outside of a fic. I don't care much about Hermione either way. I like stories where she's a villain, an antihero, a talented genius, on the spectrum - etc etc. What annoys me is when people become so wrapped up in their belief of who a character is - amazing Hermione, horrible Hermione, etc - that they're unable to ever see the character differently, no matter the story.
