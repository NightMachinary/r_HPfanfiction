  DON'T DOWNVOTE.
#+end_quote

Don't vote-manipulate, ask for votes (that includes asking people to /abstain/ from voting), or complain about votes you are or are not getting on a post (which also includes telling people to abstain from voting your post down).

EDIT: Vote manipulation is a specific thing that probably isn't happening here. Added some other "don't"s that fit more here.
