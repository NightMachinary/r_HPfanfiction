Not really my jam, but Linkffn(dodging prison and stealing witches) is a pretty solid fic and Harry gets a pretty big one over on Dumbles at the end of year one.

Also, because it sounds like you're in a pretty dark place where dumbeldore is concerned, maybe you'd like to read linkffn(dumbledore's next great adventure), where a "Good dumbledor" replaces an evil Dumbledore and works to fix his doppleganger's mistakes.
