No but honestly- I think I started reading your work back when you'd write Percy Jackson and Dr Who fics in like 2010 or something. I was so excited when I saw that you were doing Antithesis! Your writing has gotten so good-you're really talented! Even if the ending of Antithesis made me throw some things lol
