The biggest problem in literature is that setting up relationships takes up time/pages. You get the reader rooting for the relationship and then have them break up. Since most people don't jump from one relationship straight into the next, you need some time to pass before building up the next relationship, beginning with attraction and the first tentative steps. Then you need to develop it into something meaningful...

Oh right, there was this thing called main plot. Unless you are writing an epic set over several years, multiple relationships aren't really within the scope of most fanfics since there is more going on than just who will bang (unless your whole story is just a romance).
