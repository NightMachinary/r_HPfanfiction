The only one I can remember and its really bad (that part in specific, I rather liked this fic, except for "I do not forgive, I do not forget" meme) is linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) [[/spoiler][where Harry and Katie are supposed to be going out and Katie just fucks up by saying yes to the Yule Ball to some dude. They breakup and Harry moves on to Fleur, eventually...]] It takes some time and it isn't a good romance by any stretch of the imagination, but it is serviceable.
