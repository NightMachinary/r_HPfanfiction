The first two books are only on ffn. From book 3 you can follow it on livejournal here: [[https://lightningwave.livejournal.com/13503.html]]

But note that it doesn't actually differ from the ffn version until book 5/6. And even then there's probably only a handful of chapters which have a single different scene.
