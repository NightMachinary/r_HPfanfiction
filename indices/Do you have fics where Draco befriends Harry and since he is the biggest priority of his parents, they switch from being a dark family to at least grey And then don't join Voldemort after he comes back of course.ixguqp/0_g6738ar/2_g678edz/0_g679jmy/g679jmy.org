You can't separate the story from the relationship - Harry's character growth is tied into his relationship with Draco, and thus affects his actions and the course of the story.

So you couldn't just cut out the relationship and be left with the same story.

But at the same time there is tonnes of stuff going on beyond that relationship. Harry's relationship with his brother, his parents and Snape are nearly as important as the relationship with Draco. There is lots of mystery, an intricate plot and so much world building it can be hard to keep track. It also has the best cast of OCs that I've seen in any fanfiction - filled with unique and fascinating personalities.

Also worth mentioning the actual smutty scenes have been cut out of the ffn version, but they can be found on the author's own website for anyone interested.
