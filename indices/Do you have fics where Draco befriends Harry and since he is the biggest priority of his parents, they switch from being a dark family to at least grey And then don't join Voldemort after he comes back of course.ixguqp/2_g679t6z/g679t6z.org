Dethryl's "They Shook Hands" series has Harry and Draco as best friends, with Lucius refusing to rejoin Voldemort due to Harry being an integral part of their lives by the time Voldemort returns. Nonslash, Lucius ends up (semi-grudgingly) working with Dumbledore. The Malfoys are very much Malfoys still, just on Harry's side. 6 years complete, the author recently posted about brainstorming for Y7 on facebook.
