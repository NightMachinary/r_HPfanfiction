Harry /does/ question their beliefs later on. He didn't say anything at the beginning due to him not wanting to lose the first friends he ever had. It's actually spawns a major plot point between him and one of his friends that lasts for a few books.

Now the Hermione thing, well I can't say much about her due to it reveling some spoilers. /Ron/ however is antagonistic due to Harry being Slytherin but he's not a doormat. Ron gives as good as he gets from the Slytherins and some of the things he does in response gives characterization and development to Harry. It's not bashing for bashing's sake.
