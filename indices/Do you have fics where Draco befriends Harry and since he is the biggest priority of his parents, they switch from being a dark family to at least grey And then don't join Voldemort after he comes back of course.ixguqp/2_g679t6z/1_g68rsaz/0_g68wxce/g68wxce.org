I just tried to get into this series again but I can never get past the beginning....they all call Hermione a mud blood and Harry just rolls with it? Hermione is randomly sorted into Hufflepuff despite it making the least amount of sense for her? If that's not a red flag for a bash fest idk what is. Ron bashing I kind of assume is a given.

If there's one thing I can't stand about Slytherin Harry stories it's when he acts like a complete doormat
