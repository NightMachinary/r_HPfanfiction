FFN, under the username Dethryl. I would reccommend only reading the rewritten version - the author reposted the originals when he started rewriting everything on FFN, but they are among the oldest fanfics out there and rather subpar.

On an interesting side note, this series spawned a fair few of the modern slytherin!Harry tropes.
