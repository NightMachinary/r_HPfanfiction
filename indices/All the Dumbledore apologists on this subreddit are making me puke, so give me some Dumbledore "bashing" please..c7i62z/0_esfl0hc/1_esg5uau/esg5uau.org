I've read the first one (one if my favorites) and the first part of the second one.

I completely agree that Rowling never intended Dumbledore to be evil but she wrote him that way. If he isn't malicious then he's absolutely senile. The Chamber incident isn't weird though. Dumbledore knew Riddle was responsible and a thorough investigation of the bathroom where Myrtle was found would have led to the discovery of the entrance. It is rather irrelevant that other people didn't get a trial because none of them were Order members and Secret Keepers for the Child of Prophecy. Dumbledore should have at least spoken to him in prison. And Snape and the other Death Eaters knew Pettigrew was the real traitor anyway.

Dumbledore's senility is amply demonstrated in the people he trusts with his "plans": Harry and Snape. One is an abused child he's groomed to commit suicide and the other is a petty, bitter and vindictive child abuser and terrorist. This in spite of there being so many other trustworthy Order members around.
