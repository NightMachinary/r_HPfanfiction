linkffn(Faery Heroes) linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution) It's not that I don't understand the viewpoint, I really do, but unlike Snape, his character does have good to him.

I just think Rowling did that transition to an young adult series badly. You can't justify leaving Harry in an abusive home, but dismissing his concerns is something an adult would do. The Chamber is weird, but I always though Myrtle refused to talk to anyone except Harry. Not getting Sirius a trial sounds malicious, but a lot of death eaters didn't. It's a huge abrogation of responsibility, but it wasn't designed to keep Harry abused. Still, I'd rather read a competent Dumbledore & Harry fic with a super Voldemort.

Overall, Dumbledore in canon is incompetent, not malicious. He shouldn't be leading the effort, not because he refuses to kill (how would have exposing Voldemort worked if he had killed the death eaters and Voldemort had escaped ahead of time), but because he refuses to share information. The Horcrux hunt seems up Moody's and Bill's alley, not a trio of dropouts.
