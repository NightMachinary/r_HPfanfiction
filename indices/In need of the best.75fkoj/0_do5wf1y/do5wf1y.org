I'd say Hogwarts Houses Divided is a great fic to read after having finished the books. It follows Teddy Lupin's first year at Hogwarts, along with some new kids related to familiar characters in various ways -- though Harry has a semi-major role as Teddy's godfather, Neville is the most prominent teacher as Head of Gryffindor, and pretty much every surviving character from the series make at least a cameo.

The tone and feel is pretty close to the original books, if perhaps a little more focusing on problems that the books ignored, such as the negative sides of the inter-house rivalries.
