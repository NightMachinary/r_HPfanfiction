+That's pretty much NOT how you should self-promote, yikes.+

+Popular fics usually are popular BECAUSE they're good. I agree with the other commenter, maybe link your own stuff for people to check out instead of making assumptions and passive-aggressive swipes at stuff people enjoy? Or don't say anything at all, if you can't bother being nice..+

EDIT: As you didn't mean it that way, I wanted to edit my comment to reflect that! It sounded shitty at first, but we've ALL been misunderstood online sometimes.

I was creepy and dug through your profile til I found you on ff.n and looked at one of your stories - I thought it was weirdly heartbreaking, and very good! I'm StrawberryShortcat on ff.n, and I would have reviewed from my account, but no one can log in to their accounts right now for some reason :/ Anyway, don't let the crappy people get to you.
