Read up on disliked tropes in /HP/ fanfiction first, /please/, especially if you think you'll hook people onto the projects with calm statements like "Harry can go into Slytherin" and "Harry/Hermione shipped". But in theory, the idea of such a project has merits.

Not sure what a Slytherin Champion in the Triwizard Tournament would be for; if you're doing a Slytherin Harry, that would mean two Champions from the same House. Bit boring. Whether or not one likes Cedric, his status in /Goblet of Fire/ has the merit of meaning someone from one of the "NPC houses" gets prominently featured for a change. ...If you're doing this at all, I'd recommend overhauling the Tournament completely, really. Different Tasks, different /number/ of Tasks perhaps, different Champions altogether --- perhaps three teams of three?
