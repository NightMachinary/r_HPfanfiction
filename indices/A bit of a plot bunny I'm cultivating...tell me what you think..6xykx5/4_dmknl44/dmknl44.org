I think it could be good. The premise might be a bit bland, but it could make for some great character interaction. I'd love to read about the relationship she establishes with young Harry.

Honestly, a lot of my story ideas start with a premise that isn't really all that interesting in itself; I usually come up with interesting twists later.
