As an idea (and please forgive me) is nothing spectacular. Mediocre time travel, raise Harry, fix the world thing. Right? However even mediocre idea can be made into fantastic and captivating story with good enough writing and twists. So why not give it a go? "Insert bad thing here" - what would that be?

Here's an idea: how about her going back in time actually caused the "insert bad thing here" to happen in the first place? What if without ever realising it she had already been part of Harry's life and his teacher? Now that might be a a story with twist worth reading. Just imagine the final climax scene where she would realise it was her meddling all along that cause "Insert bad thing here" :D
