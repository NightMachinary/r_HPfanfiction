You're going to need to specify that. If it's Voldemort, then she can bring enough information to Dumbledore to make him a non-issue. There was an earlier thread ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6t1jum/hermione_was_thrown_back_25_years_to_1976_what/]]) where it was discussed; and many of the plans described apply to post-Voldemort-discorporation as well as to pre-Voldemort-discorporation.
