Crossovers tend to get overlooked quite a bit. I'll see if I can dig up a few that don't really need the context of the other fandom.

Felix Fortuna: linkffn(13347956)

Only context you need is that the people mentioned in the opening scene are all Superheroes or Supervillains. They quickly become irrelevant after that. MC also has a superpower, but it's pretty apparent what it is, and I didn't find it detracted from the fic.

Harry Potter and the Natural 20: linkffn(8096183)

Classic example of crack played straight. Crossover with one of the earlier DnD editions, but you don't need to know anything about it.

Batman Doesn't 'Do' Magic: linkffn(8827254)

A little rough around the edges, and a bit weird, but this one filled an afternoon for me. I've never read or watched anything with Batman in it, and I followed this fine.

Full Metal Alchemist (linkffn(11823256), linkffn(11949378)):

These two both have the same rough premise are probably on the edge of fandom-outsider comprehensibility. If you're unfamiliar with Full Metal Alchemist, you could you could muddle through things with a quick wiki-walk or two. Maybe give them a miss if that's a problem.
