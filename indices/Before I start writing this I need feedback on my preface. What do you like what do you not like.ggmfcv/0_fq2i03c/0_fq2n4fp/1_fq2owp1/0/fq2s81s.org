I also have Dumbeldore's, Snapes, Fudge, and Tywin's reaction to Joffrey ordering Ned Stark's death mapped out. Dumbeldore is going to be somewhat "manipulative" but good in this story but when this breaks out he's like WTF Robert, why couldn't you give the throne to Ned, instead of just drinking yourself to an early grave and causing another pittless nightmare for me.
