Wow this looks really cool!! Except that I'm kinda sad that Daenerys won't be a Targaryen. Do you have a specific reason for that? Or is it just because you don't want to cause conflict between her and Jon? Is Jon still a Targaryen? Are all people in Westeros wizards? If not do the muggles in Westeros know about magic? Also which magical school do wizards of Westeros go to? Can people leave Westeros freely? Will it be more developed I mean not set in "medieval" times? Also when I say Westeros I always mean all 3 countries you mentioned just forgot the name of the others.

Sorry for all the questions XD
