1. Yes there's a hidden reason for Dany's last name being Greengrass.
2. Jon is not a Targeryen (He and Arya are Lyanna and Sirius Black's kids).
3. All people in Westeros know magic and can perform it. Muggles do not know Westeros, Essos, and Sothrous exist.
4. Westerois kids can attend Hogwarts, Beuxobetens, Durmstang, and the American school.
5. It depends if they are in a war or not. Hint War of the Five Wizard Kings is incoming.
6. It will be a semi modern westerosi wizard society with elements of midevil aspects played into it.

Does this explain it better?
