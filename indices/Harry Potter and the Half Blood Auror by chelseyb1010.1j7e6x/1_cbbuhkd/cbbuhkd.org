This is my favourite Harry/Tonks fic. Both the action and the romance are well written, Harry and Tonks have a great chemistry that accurately reflects their canon personalities.

  In his quest to stop Malfoy in his sixth year, Harry turns to an old friend for help. Along the way he finds new allies, a Horcrux, & someone to stand by his side. Alternate view of HBP. Rating for language & violence.
