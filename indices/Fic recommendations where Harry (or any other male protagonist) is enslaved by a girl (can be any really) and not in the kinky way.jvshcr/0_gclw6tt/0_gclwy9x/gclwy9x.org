Maybe I used the word 'enslaved' a little loosely. Kind of like Dumbledore said that Merope enslaved Tom Riddle. I meant 'seduce' and then keeping the seduced one emotionally dependent of the seducer. I was thinking more along the lines of tropes that appear in the story of King David and Bathsheba or Macbeth and his wife.

Actually the first story I found while searching was the one you recommended but in that one Daphne is kind of good and she is only grooming Harry to be her mate or something. Also there Harry is literally enslaved without any seduction or through other mind altering means.
