That's what I am going by as well but I'm trying to avoid using magical mind altering means for it. I want it to happen gradually and naturally so that the reader doesn't even notice how it happens. I mean I know in real life, the more a person gets to know us the more comfortable they feel asking stuff from us but most of us are not celebrities or influential figures enough that we can literally put the world at our lovers' feet. And that's the part where I'm getting stuck at.
