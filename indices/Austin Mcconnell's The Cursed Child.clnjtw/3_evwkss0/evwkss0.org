I haven't seen that but I did have an idea for a different take on the CC as soon as I read the script, and started writing it within 24 hours of the script being released (while I was still sticking pins in a model of Jack Thorne). I didn't finish it until last year and it didn't get many reads. I don't think there's much of an appetite for CC fics unless they are Scorpius/Albus. Or maybe it's just mine.
