I dunno, I watched that video and I'm not convinced the storyline is any better than the original. I don't think /Cursed Child/'s problem was in the basic concepts, it's just really lackluster execution. You don't need to turn the concept of Delphini inside out, you just need to actually explore the implications of her nature. Same for Cedric, same for the Trolley Witch, same for everbody. McConnell's synopsis, written in the same mindset by the same people as the original, would have, I think, turned out precisely as rubbish.
