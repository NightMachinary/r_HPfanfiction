Susan Bones, just as an example, talks to Harry in canon, which is more than most third-string student characters. She seemed to believe Harry was Slytherin's Heir, but was sitting with Hermione and apparently was on friendly terms with her at the start of the year. She hung out with her fellow Hufflepuffs and seemed to get along with that crowd. The Slytherins harassed her and she joined the DA for ideological reasons, like many others. This seems to have nothing to do with her in this fanfic.

In any case, what most characters are and do doesn't seem like what we saw in the books. And that's because the world is so different. They grew up into different people, so why should I care about them here?

I know I said it felt like original fiction, but there is one place it doesn't work like that: a lot of the feel of story is still hung on the reader knowing and being interested in the named characters. With how AU it is, that doesn't really work for me. But that's just my opinion.
