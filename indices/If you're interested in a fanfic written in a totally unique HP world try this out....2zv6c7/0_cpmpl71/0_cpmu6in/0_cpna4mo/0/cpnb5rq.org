That quoted item was pure sarcasm, if it wasn't clear.

Hermione's character is basically consistent through the series, though the focus changes. She's an archetypal swot with the Gryffindor loyalty and courage tropes added in, while also being the knowledge dump and semi self-insert character for the author various purposes.

In the books, every single action she takes comes from one of those places, or with struggling to live up to those ideals. Pretending to be more adult than she is, and /definitely/ being more mature than her jock friends, is how she is written. And make no mistake, Harry and Ron are jocks in canon, right down to hazing Colin, fights in the halls, and their year revolving around sports.

In this story, it still seems like those characterizations carry over, and it isn't just Hermione In Name Only. In fact, I had more trouble with some of the other characters and how they had been changed. But I also wasn't terribly into it, so maybe I read shallower than others did.
