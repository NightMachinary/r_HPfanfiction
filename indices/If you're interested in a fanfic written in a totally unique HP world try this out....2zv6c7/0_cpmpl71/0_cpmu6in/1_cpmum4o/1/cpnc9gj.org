  Yeah, compared to Hermione in canon she still acts like an adult trapped in a kids body. Hermione in canon starts off as a teachers pet, tones it down eventually, but still makes plenty of mistakes.

Compared to Hermione in canon --- who was plenty precocious and mature in the first place --- Hermione in RotS was abducted from her home, told that her parents won't remember her, placed in an orphanage headed by one of the most universally despised characters in canon books, and /tortured/ after her escape attempt; and she feels that she is responsible not just for herself but also for Justin and Dean. So, yes, she's had to grow up even more quickly. And, she still makes plenty of mistakes. (List available upon request.)

  She starts off practically worshiping authority for instance.
#+end_quote

Sigh... Why does this keep coming up?

When, exactly, did she "worship authority"? Was it when she didn't want to wander around an unfamiliar magical castle at night over a matter of preadolescent honor (because, after all, there might be a hungry cerebrus out there)? Or, feared expulsion from the amazing world of magic of which she has only just gotten a taste as much as she feared death (to the extent that she understood death)? Or, didn't want Harry to risk expulsion in a dangerous competition on flying broomsticks (that he has only just learned how to ride) to return an item that Draco had stolen in front of a score witnesses? Or, was it when she casually lied to McGonagall to cover for Harry and Ron after the Troll Incident? When she set a teacher on fire (because it /was/, in fact, a matter of life and death, and not preadolescent honor)? When she questioned Dumbledore's motivations, while Harry trusted him implicitly? When she brewed a semilegal potion from stolen ingredients in order to abduct and impersonate her classmates to spy on another?

Hermione only looks like a proverbial authority-worshiper in comparison to Harry and Ron, because they act like proverbial rules don't apply to them, not out of intellectual independence or critical thinking skills of any sort, but out of impulsiveness. (To be fair, their impulsiveness has saved Hermione's life.) Hermione, on the other hand, recognizes that most rules and regulations are a good idea most of the time, but she doesn't hesitate to make exceptions if the situation warrants it.

So, can we please bury the "Hermione worships authority" fanon? Please?

  Do we need to bring up Hermione's brilliant plan of freeing house elves by putting clothes all around the tower?

Speaking of that, do you mean the one where she went against /every/ authority in the Wizarding World and faced universal ridicule, all without support of her friends, in order to follow the dictates of her conscience?
