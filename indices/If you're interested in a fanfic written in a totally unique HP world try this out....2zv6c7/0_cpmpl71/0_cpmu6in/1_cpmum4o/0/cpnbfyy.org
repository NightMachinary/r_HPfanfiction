She's also a lot more traumatized in this story than in canon. That changes some things. It isn't unreasonable to have her /acting/ years more mature in that situation.

What you mention from the books still sounds like someone /pretending/ to be more mature and adult than they really are. Which is why I said what I did, based on a similar reading of the books.

Seems like you want this "false" maturity to be punished more or something. Like her being successful should be served in equal measure with childish failure.

Hermione in the books seldom failed when something serious was on the line, which again seems consistent in this story. If anything, she fails more and more often. It is just that most things in this story are really serious issues, so complete failure or a house-elf level misunderstanding would most often be fatal.
