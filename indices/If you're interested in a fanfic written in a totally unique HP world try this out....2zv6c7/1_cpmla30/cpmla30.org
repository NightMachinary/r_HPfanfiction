This fic is labeled in a very strange way. It's H/Hr, but as of the most recent update Hermione betrays Harry... for Draco. It's labeled AU and the first A/N talks about characters acting OOC but that plot point is just too unbelievable.

Thank you for sharing it, but I suspect it's just not for me. I'm sure many others will enjoy it, though.
