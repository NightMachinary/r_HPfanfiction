  who was blackmailing her
#+end_quote

To my recollection all Draco did was threaten revenge upon her for beating him. He then suggested that would be forgiven if she were to join his side against Harry. Verrrrrrrrry thin pretext for her to change her mind.

  What will she actually do?
#+end_quote

The narrative voice used throughout that scene describes Hermione's loathing of Draco, but does not give any indication that she will not follow through with Draco's plan. Indeed, she doesn't even attempt to warn Harry. So if the author goes back on his plan for her to side with Draco, then all he's succeeded in doing is making her indecisive.
