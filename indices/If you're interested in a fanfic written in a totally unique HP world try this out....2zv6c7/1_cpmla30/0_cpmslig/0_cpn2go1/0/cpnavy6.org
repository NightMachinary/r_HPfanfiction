  To my recollection all Draco did was threaten revenge upon her for beating him.

Yes, by revealing to everyone that she and Justin and Dean are Mudbloods, for starters. That's blackmail.

  The narrative voice used throughout that scene describes Hermione's loathing of Draco, but does not give any indication that she will not follow through with Draco's plan. Indeed, she doesn't even attempt to warn Harry. So if the author goes back on his plan for her to side with Draco, then all he's succeeded in doing is making her indecisive.

Hermione? Having to decide on the spot between simple loyalty of Harry and playing Draco's games, not just for herself, but for two other people for whom she feels responsible? That, after having had a vision quest which showed her --- among other things --- Harry can, in fact, betray her in a possible future, and that she may be able to achieve her political goals by first siding with Draco then murdering him? How could that /possibly/ make her indecisive?

Anyway, I read that as an offer she can't refuse, even if it has the potential to drive a wedge between herself and Harry.
