  Canon Hermione suffered torture at the hands of Bellatrix and the potential end of her relationship with Ron rather than betray Harry at Malfoy Manor or in the Forest of Dean

The two situations aren't even remotely comparable. You compare a Hermione at the start of RotS to Hermione in canon DH, after more than six years of friendship with Harry, fighting side by side, and saving each other's lives several times; their mission would determine whether or not the world would be ruled by an immortal tyrant bent on genocide of people just like her; not to mention six years of being inculcated with Gryffindor values.

In RotS, Hermione met Harry a few months ago, she doesn't even particularly like him, getting along with him out of pragmatism. She feels far more loyalty towards Justin and Dean, so of course she would sell Harry out for her own and for their sakes. Rather than having had six years of Gryffindor adventures under the kindly Dumbledore, she feels wronged by the wizarding world and has resolved to [[https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Gone_with_the_Wind_%28film%29#Scarlett_O.27Hara][lie, steal, cheat, or kill (in the immortal words of Scarlet O'Hara)]] to get what she wants out of it, though her vision quest is making her question some of that. So, her decision makes perfect sense to me. It's just focusing on the side of the character that a lot of the fandom forgets.
