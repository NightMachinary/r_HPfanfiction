  How could that possibly make her indecisive?

Alright, would inconsistently written be better?

Canon Hermione suffered torture at the hands of Bellatrix and the potential end of her relationship with Ron rather than betray Harry at Malfoy Manor or in the Forest of Dean. This deviation - even if you don't believe it to be as important as I do - makes this character Hermione In Name Only as another comment in this thread stops short of saying. My own opinion is that the characterizations are /so/ different as to suggest that her role might be better filled by an OC.
