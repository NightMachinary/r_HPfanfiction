Spoilers for the uninitiated:

- Harry was going to kill Voldemort eventually, and Voldemort was going to be okay with it.
- Voldemort would learn Harry's birthday, but would be terribly conflicted and finally unable to finish the boy fated to be his equal.
- Snape was still going to kill Dumbledore, either that or secretly join him to help bring about Harry defeating Voldemort.
- Harry was probably going to end up with Hermione. I mean, it would have been more appropriate for Harry to remain celibate or end up with an OC, but that seems to be the way things were going. Voldemort was going to kill her, Harry wouldn't let him.
- After Voldemort dies, Harry ends up in a career as a druid, like Carrigan, and the book essentially ends with Harry meeting Tom Riddle's reincarnation.
- Voldemort's renaissance of the pagan arts would still have continued with his death, with Harry as its champion, but with Harry now assuming a nomadic, reclusive lifestyle even as a more democratic style of governance took over.
- Europe would hem-and-haw, but Voldemort was probably going to kill the French Royalty at some point and try to keep pushing further before his end came.
- Various characters end up together (Draco/Natalie, Ron/OC, probably a lot of slash pairings as well, etc.).

Just some thoughts.
