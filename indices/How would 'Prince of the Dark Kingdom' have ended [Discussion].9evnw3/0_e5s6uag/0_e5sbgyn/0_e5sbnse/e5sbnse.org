Well it was either that or my other thought:

Voldemort dies and becomes the Winter King after dethroning Gundalari, and when Harry dies he succeeds Voldemort as the Spring King. Which is sort of the metaphor of all my earlier take. Voldemort is the winter of darkness, Harry brings light and spring by overthrowing him.
