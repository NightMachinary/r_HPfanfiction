I think I may love you for this post, it would have brought such a neat conclusion to the whole affair.I kind of doubt Tom Riddle (from the diary) would have survived, he was never really canny enough I felt, but otherwise this would have been great. Unless you mean the soul as a whole's reincarnation in which case that's very plausible.
