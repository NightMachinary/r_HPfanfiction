You could try linkao3(Love in the Eye of a Storm by rattlesoft) - it's a post-war Hermione/Narcissa fic wrapped around an island mystery.

Not to be outdone (especially since it was written earlier), there's a Hermione/Pansy post-war island mystery story by Inell called [[http://inell.avada-kedavra.net/viewstory.php?sid=397&ageconsent=ok&warning=2][The Island of Second Chances]].

I guess the trend here is 'mysterious Hermione is domme Hermione'.
