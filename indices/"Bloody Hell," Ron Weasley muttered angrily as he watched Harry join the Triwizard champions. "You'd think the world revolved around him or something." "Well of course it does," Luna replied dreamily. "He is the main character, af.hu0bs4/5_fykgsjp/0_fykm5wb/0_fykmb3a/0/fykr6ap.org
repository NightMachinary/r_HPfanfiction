The reader wonders whether Harry's adventures, as they are about to come to an end, happened only in her/his head and Dumbledore reinforces the fact that they did but it doesn't mean they were not real, especially because the book series were very popular with people who were about 17-18 when the series ended (basically grew together with Harry).
