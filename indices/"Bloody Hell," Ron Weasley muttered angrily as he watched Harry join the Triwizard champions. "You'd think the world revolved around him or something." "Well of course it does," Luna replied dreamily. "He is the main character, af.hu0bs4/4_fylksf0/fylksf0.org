This reminds me of a response to a Writing Prompt I did a couple years back.

I'll post it here, since it fits the general theme and it's archived on the link:

It was a chilly October evening, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione were back for their final year of Hogwarts. After a year of hunting down Horcruxes and a climactic showdown at Hogwarts castle, the trio was hoping for the possibility of one last normal year as a Hogwarts student. Not that they knew what a normal year at Hogwarts looked like, but they were hoping all the same. They had yet to reveal any plots to kill Harry Potter, so the three friends were cautiously optimistic about their chances.

Nonetheless, life went on at Hogwarts, and it seems that Harry's massive fame had finally spread to all of Dumbledore's Army, and especially his "generals" Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna, and Neville.

After 2 months of young students crowding them and asking about escaping on dragons and fighting Death Eaters, it took a toll on them all, which is why Harry, Ron, and Hermione were seeking respite in the Room of Requirement.

"Blimey, Harry, I can't bel-"

/pop/

All of the sudden, there inside the room, appeared 3 people who looked like movie star versions of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.

All six people drew their wands.

"Oi, who're you lot?" said book Ron, indignantly.

"We could ask you the same thing." said movie Hermione.

"How did you get in here?" asked book-Hermione, puzzled.

"What do you mean? You appeared here," said movie Ron, worriedly and confused.

Book-Harry looked at the three intruders intensely, assessing how they moved and talked. They looked so familiar to him, but more than that, he felt some sort of connection, somehow. Over the years, he had honed his instincts and learned to trust them, and now, they were telling him that he didn't need to fear these familiar strangers. Still, he had to be safe.

"You. Pretty boy. Name?" asked book-Harry.

"Wot?..Harry. Harry Potter."

"What? That's impossible!" exclaimed book-Hermione.

"Why's that, then?" said movie Harry.

"Because that's Harry Potter, right there. "

"What? That's impossible." said movie Hermione, eyebrows furrowed.

Movie Harry looked at movie Hermione and book Harry looked at book Hermione.

"Really, Hermione? After everything you've seen?" Said both Harrys at the same time.

"There you go, Harry. I knew there was hope for you yet." Said a new voice dreamily, as they all looked around to see a familiar blonde girl appear out of nowhere.

"Luna!?" Exclaimed both trios.

For indeed, Luna Lovegood had appeared in front of them. Oddly enough, both sides immediately recognized her, as it seemed that her appearance had features that they each knew of her, but were somehow mixed in with what was presumably the other trio's Luna's features.

"Hello, everyone. It's nice to see all of you. " said Luna, smiling serenely. " I can see that there are a lot of Wrackspurts in here, so let me clear up the confusion."

The 6 members of the two Golden Trios at this point were flabbergasted, so they allowed Luna to continue.

"We're all fictional characters. You lot, are from a popular book series, and you over there are from the movie adaptation of said book series."

"And what about you? Which are you from? " Said book-Ron, skeptically.

"Neither." replied Luna, dreamily and mysteriously. " I'm an almalgamation of all of the fan-fiction Luna Lovegoods, which means I know way too much information about weird or impossible events because I'm supposedly a Seer or a great prophet, even though in both the book and in the movie, I'm simply a bit eccentric. "

"Erm...and why're you here?" asked book Harry.

"Why, to explain all of this and diffuse the tension, of course. " replied Luna, oddly. "Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to go talk to a time-travelling Harry Potter and completely catch him off guard by noting how old his eyes look. Nice to see everyone!"

Luna walks to the door and leaves. Harrys were caught off guard.

"When Voldemort used Avada Kedavra on you again, who did you talk to?" asked book-Harry.

"Dumbledore. Your Firebolt. Who gave it to you?" said movie Harry.

"Sirius. As a Christmas present. Went on to win the Quidditch Cup with it that year."

"Wait, wot? I didn't get mine until the end of the year! Why-"

"Budget constraints!" Yelled fan-fiction Luna, cheerily and dreamily.

Both Rons move off to the side.

"So, are we really gonna believe ol' loony Luna?" said book-Ron.

"I suppose so, mate." said movie Ron, nodding.

"And that's /really/ your Hermione? I mean, I'm happy with mine. She's the best thing that ever happened to me, but that's really your Hermione?" Asked book Ron, incredulously.

"Yeah," replied movie-Ron, grinning.

"Blimey." said book-Ron, admiringly.

"Yeah." agreed movie-Ron proudly.

"/Ronald!/" said both Hermione exasperatedly
