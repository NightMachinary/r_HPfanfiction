Hah! Definitely lots of ones that are not porn. I'll throw everything in here then. They tend toward the crack humor plotless side of things (hope you don't mind) and are primarily next gen. I know lots of people look for adventure novels similar to HP when they mean OCs, which is something I can rec much less about. Of dramatic OC stories, I can't rec [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=141880][celticbard]] enough. An awesome historical drama/horror writer, lots of completed stories. Also [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=193853][Toujours Padfoot]] also writes literally every genre from the crackiest humour to action to romance.

  [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=268282][The Morning Waffle]] always amongst my first to rec for next gen humour (she writes lots of lovely stories, mostly of the Weasley clan)

  [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304128][Some Kind of Beauty]] the other next gen story I always rec, just too lovely and heartwarming. Also two oneshots, [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=295865][Hourglass Tilting]] and [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=296084][Crown]] by her; wonderful dark stories.

  [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=293736][It's Called Adventure]] Hugo, Scorpius, Neville story. if you'd like something sweet and charming.

  [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=307662][Muggle Studies]] if you like a spot of puns and plenty of literature and everything else references. Lots of other stories too, but mostly romance and/or incomplete, so if you don't mind.

  [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=283722][Starving Artists]] if you want to lulz over art school, the avant-garde, and poetry.

  [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=290281][Napoleon's Complex]] I don't know if you mean no romance or just no smut, but here's a sort of romance with Albus as the narrator. I'd best describe it as something like (500) Days of Summer in tone.

  [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=311891][Behind the Curtain]] Cold war thriller. Not my taste, but I have friends who like it, so I thought I'd throw it in. He's also got some lulzy Voldemort stories.

  And, if you'd like, here's my story with an OC lead, [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294543][And Capers Ensue]]. I've never posted it here before, heh; always been sort of nervous about it. I'm working on the next chapter for it right now. It's ensemble-cast adventure-comedy.

  [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=295307][Friendship for Dummies]] Terry Boot + OC oneshot

  [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=295307][A Cautionary Tale]] Rose/Scorpius parody

  [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=282694][You're Gonna Miss Me]] Roger Davies fic. Romance but love the style. Big fan of the author, but mostly incomplete works on her page.

  [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=280023][Game, Set, Match]] One of my favorite duel sequences ever.

And really, most of these authors are amongst my favorite, so if you like something, check out their page :) I generally rec only completed stories, and there's quite a lot of WIPs floating around there. Anyhow, I'm posting this rather late, so if you happen to read this by the unfortunate HPFF maintenance time (which should be about 10 minutes from now), then you won't be able to access the site until :20 or so. Hope you find something you like!
