On the Way to Greatness - linkffn(4745329) - is my favourite Slytherin Harry fic by far. He's definitely not canon Harry, nor does he magically become friends with Malfoy or get along with Snape just because he's a Slytherin, which is a trope I see a lot. He really feels like a Slytherin. If you're going to read it though I should mention the first two years or so are still very similar to canon and feel rather summary-like but the story definitely takes off on its own after that.
