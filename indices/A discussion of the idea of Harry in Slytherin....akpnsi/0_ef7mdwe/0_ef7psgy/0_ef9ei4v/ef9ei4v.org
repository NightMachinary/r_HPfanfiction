Yeah, Snape and Malfoy - /especially/ Malfoy, who's an arrogant git - being suddenly friends with Harry is one I see quite a bit of where I have a real hard time, because Malfoy is an even worse bully than Dudley, and I really don't see that being any different. If anything I think it would probably be even /worse/ with Harry being in the same House.

Snape is more complex, because on the one hand, Harry is the spitting image of James - who was a right foul git towards Snape in his own right when they were at school, from the little that we know - but on the other his personality and character seems very /unlike/ his father's, and IMO possibly closer to his mother's. So there's narrative potential there that's wasted in scenarios where, as you put it, Harry suddenly befriends Snape.
