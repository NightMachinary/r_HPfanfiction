The Slytherin Harry idea has been done to death, to the point where it's a cliche and very trope-y; it has to add new things or new twists in order for me to find it personally interesting.

I feel that him being sorted in Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff is written much less, and could potentially be written interestingly.

What if Harry hid in the school's library at the Muggle school, away from Dudley? What if he was more interested in studying or learning about the Wizarding World at large?

What if his loyalty showed up more, what if he displayed other personality traits that would show him being sorted into Hufflepuff? What if he could unite the four houses this way?

I like the Slytherin Harry idea, but the execution is often rather poor or indifferent about the ideal. (IMO; from what I've seen).
