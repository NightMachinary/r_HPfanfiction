  Hermione was not a pleasant person to be around in the first book.

Lord knows /that's/ true. IIRC, it's mentioned in /PS/ that the troll incident was a major milestone in that Hermione mellowed out considerably after that. That said, Hermione as a Ravenclaw would be around a lot more students who are more likely to be similarly...unpleasant, which makes things interesting in terms of how that might affect her character as well.
