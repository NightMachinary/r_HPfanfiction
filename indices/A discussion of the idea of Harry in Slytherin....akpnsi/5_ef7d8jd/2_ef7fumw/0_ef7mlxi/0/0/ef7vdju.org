Not necessarily. We know that accidental magic can make you shock resistant and elastic. Neville was thrown out of a window and simply bounced back up. And without Harry there, Ron wouldn't be making that remark in the first place, or at least not make it at the exact time Hermione was nearby. The odds of that scenario happening like it did without Harry involved are ridiculously small.
