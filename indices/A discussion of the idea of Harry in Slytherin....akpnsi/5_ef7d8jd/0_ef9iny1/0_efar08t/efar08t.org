I agree that (Mo-)Ron would be out of the picture (he's too narrow minded and prejudiced (he's a more intelligent Hagrid for fuck's sake and believes that all bad wizards are Slytherins!)), same for Hermione (at first at least) because no troll (or if there is, then Harry wouldn't know that Hermione is missing as she's not in his house and he didn't witness Ron being a dumbass (or if he did he would still not know that Hermione is missing, unless he pays special attention to her!)...Hermione might DIE! Hell, this could be something that kicks Harry into action as it shows a cunning and ambitious guy (Slytherin after all) that the wiz-world is fucking dangerous and schools aren't a safe-place at all, so he'd take steps to make his survival more likely! Especially if he's a pariah in his year and Malfoy is abusive towards him without being stopped by Snape, despite being a fellow Slytherin! He's basically alone, he has no friends (he might talk to some of the upper years, but true friendships? I doubt it!) in his house and he knows his life might be on the line, so what would he do? Learn magic, maybe even truly dangerous (dark!) magic! Fighting fire with fire and all that!)

Hell, Harry might not even end up on the Quidditch team (would a first year Harry who's not in Neville's house and is constantly hounded by Malfoy - without anybody backing him up etc. - care to catch the remembrall?)

I agree that he'd stick with neutral purebloods ("House divide? What do I care? Sides in the last war? My family was neutral!") and half-bloods and especially muggleborns ("Houses? Seriously, they aren't super important!")
