In canon, Ginny broke free of the Diary and dumped in Myrtle's bathroom. If it were not for Harry nosing around there, the Diary could get lost for many years.

A Slytherin Harry is not likely to do that.

Thus, Sirius breaking out in Year 3 is very provable. But since Harry lives in Slytherin Dungeon, while Sirius targets the Gryffindor dorm, people are going to ask questions. My take is Sirius eats Wormtail and goes on the run. Next year, Barty Jr breaks free too and goes on the run. These two guys are going to drive the plot forward.
