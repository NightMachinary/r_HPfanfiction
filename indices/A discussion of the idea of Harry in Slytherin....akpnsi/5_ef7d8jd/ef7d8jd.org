There is a very good chance that Harry will be murdered within his sleep a week into the year.

However, since we are here to discuss a possible story, let's disregard that.

I don't think that Harry would make friends in Slytherin, at least not in his year. Malfoy is still a racist, spoiled brat and a bully who is way too much like Dudley for Harry to like. Since no Slytherin calls Malfoy out, ever, it seems unlikely that Harry would get along with any of them. I mean, we are talking about the boy who went to save the Stone without any obligation or combat capability.

No friendship with Ron, given his attitude towards Slytherin on the Hogwarts express. No friendship with Hermione since that required a troll and being Ron's friend for the exact sequence of events to happen. He might befriend her later on, but certainly not in a canon fashion. Malfoy and his "followers" are out, so no Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy or Daphne (Pansy's friend in extended canon). Honestly, either Ravenclaw friends or some Muggleborns who don't understand what the whole fuss is about (Harry Potter a Slytherin? So what?).

As for the plot, fast forward through year one. The stone should not concern Harry without Ron and Hermione to "solve" the clues and without them, the conversations with Hagrid would go differently as well. Show Harry befriending Padma and Terry, or maybe Megan Jones. No assimilation into the Weasley family.

Year two would be tricky since Harry has not a lot to base an investigation on. He knows that Malfoy is talking shit without a Tom Clancy infiltration mission. No "friendship" with Myrtle, so he does not get the diary. However, that may leave it clogging a pipe in that toilet instead of returning to Ginny, so the attacks might fizzle out on their own. So probably fast forwarding again.

Year three is where the fun can begin, the course entirely depending on Ginny's fate. Ginny dead = No Family vacation = No picture in the Prophet = No Sirius escape = Pettigrew does not leave for Albania. Of course, that chain might diverge at any point I mentioned.
