  I don't think that Harry would make friends in Slytherin, at least not in his year. Malfoy is still a racist, spoiled brat and a bully who is way too much like Dudley for Harry to like. Since no Slytherin calls Malfoy out, ever, it seems unlikely that Harry would get along with any of them.

Yeah, Malfoy being at least as bad as Dudley(if not worse) to me would guarantee that the two would /NOT/ end up on any kind of friendly terms. And Crabbe and Goyle are basically Malfoy's brainless muscle for most of the series, so the three of those would in all likelihood be the bane of Harry's existence, especially given Snape's own obvious bias towards Malfoy.

On the other hand, while it is true that in canon “no Slytherin calls Malfoy out, ever”, it's also true that I think out of the entire year, there's only like, five Slytherins that get any mention and only two or three that get any meaningful development. That leaves a lot of room for possibly developing some of the others.

What I've seen a lot, which I find less interesting even if done well, is that usually two random Slytherins end up becoming “Slytherin Ron with a different name” and “Slytherin Hermione with a different name”. Which falls into the same trap that canon does by concentrating the main characters all into the same House.

Speaking of which, here's another thought I had. I noticed reading the book that a disproportionate number of times, Gryffindor and Slytherin end up being in the same class together -- they're consistently the same two Houses together in Snape's Potions class, Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures class, and they're also the same two that are in Lupin's Defense Against the Dark Arts class. Even Madam Hooch's flying lessons in Book 1 specifically groups the two together. There are very few, if any cases where Gryffindor is in the same class with one of the other two Houses(I think Professor Sprout's Herbology class mentions a Hufflepuff student being in the same class at one point, but it's the only one I can think of)

That's something else that I think I'd want to change, because by varying the House that Gryffindor(or Slytherin, as the case may be) has class with Ravenclaw, or Hufflepuff.

  No friendship with Ron, given his attitude towards Slytherin on the Hogwarts express.

Eh, maybe. The foundation for the Harry/Ron friendship was, IMO, already laid long before they arrived at Hogwarts, when they met on the train. That said, Ron's own prejudiced attitude towards Slytherin would be an obstacle -- one that Harry would, I think, be quite keen to overcome, particularly since he would have very few other friends his own age.

  Year two would be tricky since Harry has not a lot to base an investigation on. He knows that Malfoy is talking shit without a Tom Clancy infiltration mission.

Speaking of Year 2, here's one thought I just had that /does/ complicate things quite a bit.

Assuming, unlikely as it is, that Harry ends up finding the Chamber of Secrets...no Sword of Gryffindor, since we know that the sword presents itself “to any worthy */Gryffindor/*”, and Harry would be disqualified based on that criterion...so how does he kill the basilisk?

Destroying the diary is still feasible, albeit with a great deal more difficulty. But even assuming he destroys the diary and defeats Tom, there's still the massive snake to deal with.
