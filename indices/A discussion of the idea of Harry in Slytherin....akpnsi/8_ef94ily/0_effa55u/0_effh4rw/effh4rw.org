Well, the gold standard, of course, is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Housed Divided]] by Inverarity... of course that's a next-generation fic about Teddy Lupin's first Hogwarts year, and is mostly OCs... but Inverarity has the gift so rare in a fanfic author that he can write OCs that are actually interesting and fun to read. All four houses get a good showing here, including Slytherin.

Slytherins in this fic aren't your average "elite of Hogwarts, master political manipulators at age eleven" fanfic Slytherins... they're a bunch of children and teenagers who want to seem big and bad, partly to cultivate an image, partly because Slytherins just ARE a little nastier by nature... and partly as a defense mechanism cause the other three houses hate them. I love this fic; it doesn't turn Slytherin into misunderstand woobies, but it gives plenty of reminders that however nasty they can be, they're still just KIDS.

When it comes to stories set in Harry's year with interesting Slytherin characters... eh... I could have sworn I read some... but the only one I can actually think about right now is Sekrit Project by Chilord... which isn't on any traditional fanfic sites but can be read on the Fanfiction Federation site. (You have to have a forum or Tapatalk account to read it, but it's here: [[https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/fanfictionfederation/hp-sekrit-projekt-t468.html]] )

Mind you, Sekrit Project,,, isn't... the best fic ever. It has some really neat ideas, like Harry and Ron getting involved in the organizing of the Triwizard Tournament (thereby disqualifying them form actually taking part in it) together with Slytherin girl Tracey Davis, and Ron developing a talent for potions, but there's ALSO cliches galore, the first few chapters are a pain to slog though because there's an overuse of the Marauder's Map (and the Marauders aren't nearly as funny as Chilord seems to think).... annnnnd there's more than a bit of "male sex fantasy" vibe there because one of the big plot threads involves a potion accident that turns ALL the Slytherin students, male and female, first-years to seventh-years, into incredibly hot girls.

...yeah. And, let's put it this way, they're very clearly incredibly hot girls that are written by a heterosexual dude.

Thing is, though, SOMEHOW in this fic the Slytherins are FUN to read. Both before and after their transformation into incredibly hot girls, they have PERSONALTIES. They have conversations that are interesting. It's also kind of nice to see Tracey Davis be the main Slytherin for once, not Draco Malfoy or Daphne Greengrass.

The Gryffindor/Slytherin conflict's also done better than in many fanfics, because this fic at least points out that both Gryffindor and Slytherin are at fault.
