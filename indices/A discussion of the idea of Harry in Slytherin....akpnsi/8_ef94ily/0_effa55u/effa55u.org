Can I get a link for those stories with interesting Slytherin characters? I want to give them a chance after reading The Red Knight the other day (only until ch13 or so) - the writing is better than most fics I read but I just can't seem to get into the dialogue and jokes, I thought the interaction between Ron and the characters would be amusing but for some reason it's just not doing it for me. It's like... I'm outside looking in? Can't seem to care about the main casts despite the story written in 1st person?
