My main problem with "Harry in Slytherin" fics is that it hardly ever does anything interesting with the characters.

Let's face it, in canon the Slytherins are barely characters at all... Draco Malfoy is the only real three-dimensional Slytherin in Harry's year. Otherwise? Pansy Parkinson's a bitch with no redeeming qualities and Blaise Zabini is arrogant and self-obsessed... and Crabbe and Goyle are stupid minions who don't even get a spoken line until the very last book. The rest of the Slytherins are just names. They get NO characterization. The only thing we know about Milicent Bulstrode is that she's ugly and has a cat. Theodore Nott can apparently see Thestrals, but he gets no attention in the books. The rest of them are just a bunch of names, if that.

With Slytherin!Harry, a fanfic author has to essentially create a lot of OCs with canon names.Problem is, fandom cliches are rampant, and so we get awful stuff like Daphne Greengrass, Ice Queen of Slytherin, and a house of children obsessed with political manipulations, written by people who don't have the first clue about children OR about political manipulations.

Only a FEW stories I ever read made the Slytherins interesting characters, and none of them featured Slytherin!Harry.
