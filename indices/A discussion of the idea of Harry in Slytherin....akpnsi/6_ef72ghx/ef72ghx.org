Eh, there are a fair number of entertaining fics that run with the idea. In addition to InquisitorCOC's recommendations, PoS linkffn(11191235) has much larger divergences as the story goes on, and the main characters are definitely spread out. There are several other fics that also address the issues you have with Slytherin. Another great fic that isn't a Slytherin fic, but has all the child characters in different houses, is What You Leave Behind linkffn(10758358). Harry is aged up a year and is friends with Cho and Cedric.

For your idea, you could go with the structure of a more AU fic like Black Luminary or Hogwarts Battle School- you essentially change the setup and specifics of the world fairly drastically, no canon events occur, but you're still working with similar pieces, characters, locations, etc and the fic still takes place at Hogwarts and captures the same feeling of magic. Or you can go the PoS/DPSW route, where you're essentially still inspired by and following canon events, but draw them out and still adding literally dozens of fresh twists rather than just one or two. I don't want to get into the specifics if that'd spoil the fics for you, but let me know if you don't mind spoilers and I can elaborate on some specific stuff that's done very well in these worlds.

Also, you have to think about it from a logical standpoint- the house system, as it's used in real life, is really just a way to organize the kids into groups for support, housing, and scheduling ease. And the proximity principle means you're likely to form stronger relationships, both good and bad, with people that you're physically close to regularly. It takes extra plotting to make a stronger relationship naturally grow with those extra barriers, rather than another "Harry is in Slytherin/some other house, but oh wait! Neville and Hermione are still great friends with him just because they're popular characters," which ends up happening fairly frequently.

Also, many fics play up/overplay the animosity between houses and herd mentality, if anything, so you could always go in a different direction.
