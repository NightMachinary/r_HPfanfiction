I don't mind at all.

That's true as well, which I think is part of why the idea of splitting the Trio across different Houses appeals to me. I mean, take Ron for example. The two of them meet and are already well on their way to being friends even before the Sorting. So I think that Harry at least, who has never had a friend his own age before, would be likely to work harder to keep that first friendship even if they were split into different Houses.
