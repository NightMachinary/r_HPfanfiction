Oh, I still think Lightning on the Wave's massive epic, The Sacrifices Arc, deals with this beautifully. Each House is so diverse, full of well-rounded characters who defy easy categorization, that it quickly become apparent that, even though Slytherin!Harry certainly qualifies as Slytherin, no character is merely the sum of his or her parts, and the differences between Houses are way overblown by the characters themselves until they slowly, painfully learn better.

This Harry is certainly a kind of Gary Stu, at least in terms of raw power if not a lack of flaws (he's got them in spades). But he's also the most democratic Harry I've ever read, and the fic is focus on equality and justice in a way that no other is. So perhaps it's what you're looking for.
