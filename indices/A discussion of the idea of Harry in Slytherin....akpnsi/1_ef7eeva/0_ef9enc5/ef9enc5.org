Funny enough, originally Harry's eyes was the only thing I changed - I wanted to see what it'd look like.

Later on I changed the tie colors and the emblems on the uniforms. Initially I used the movie colors, so Hermione was in +red+*/blue/*/silver(which are the Ravenclaw colors in the movies). A week or so ago I went back and switched the silver to book-accurate bronze.blue, which I actually think looks better.
