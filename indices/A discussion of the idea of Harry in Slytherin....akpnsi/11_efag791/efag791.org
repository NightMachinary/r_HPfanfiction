Yeah, I get it, but from the outside Gryffs really are dumb! Seriously, Harry is 11 when he stops Voldemort the first time, yes he tried to get help from McGonagall, but after that fails he doesn't even try other professors or send for the Aurors (hell, he doesn't even know what an Auror is till year 4 when (Fake-)Moody shows up!)...nope, he rushes in "Super-" Harry to the rescue (despite the fact that he isn't super and Voldemort plays with him and he knows how outclassed he is! Yes it is brave, but it is also mindblowingly stupid and suicidal (not something normal teenagers do! Hell, IMHO that shows how much Harry values his own life, which isn't much! Seriously, he treats his own life like a throw away item!))

They are also narrow minded ("All bad wizards are from Slytherin!" - Yeah right, explain Pettigrew and some other DEs then, who are not Slytherin but Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and probably even Hufflepuff!)! Even supposedly super-smart Hermione is narrow minded ("You are all barbarians and slavers! Slavery of houselfs is immoral...etc." - has she cracked open a book on the subject? Has she asked the professors and her classmates about the subject? I don't think so, it's not in the book after all!)!

They are also prone to violence (yes, Draco deserved it, but they attacked him on multiple occasions (Hermion punched him for example!)) instead of looking for other solutions!

Sure the Slytherins are - from their POV - cowards, but their solutions (letting Harry and Ron run into Snape instead of duelling them etc.) are more creative and certainly better than a direct attack!

ps: I love Slytherin Harry fics where he has to fight for his place (and has setbacks!) - It's a long way to the top after all (yes: I like AC/DC!) - and has competent opponents who will not just lay down and take it!
