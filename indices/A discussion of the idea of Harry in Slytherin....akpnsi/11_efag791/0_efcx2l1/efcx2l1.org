  from the outside Gryffs really are dumb! Seriously, Harry is 11 when he stops Voldemort the first time, yes he tried to get help from McGonagall, but after that fails he doesn't even try other professors or send for the Aurors
#+end_quote

Yeah, I'm inclined to agree that Harry's shocking disregard for his own safety does border on the stupid. Being selfless, as Harry is described by Dumbledore at one point, is one thing. But Harry demonstrates a near-total lack of concern for self-preservation at multiple points that seems abnormal even for a Gryffindor.

  They are also narrow minded ("All bad wizards are from Slytherin!" - Yeah right, explain Pettigrew and some other DEs then, who are not Slytherin but Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and probably even Hufflepuff!)!

Not that I disagree with you(I don't), but I think the prejudice is less "all bad wizards are Slytherin" and more "all Slytherins are bad". The net result is the same, of course; inherent prejudice against one particular House, resulting in Slytherins in general, with only one or two exceptions, being typecast as "The Villains" - a serious flaw in the books IMO. Nowhere is this more evident than in Book 5, where the DA includes students from /every single House EXCEPT Slytherin/. You're telling me, in that entire House, there's not a single student who realized that Umbridge is evil scum and wanted to do something about it? ^{I actually had one or two ideas as to how to handle that, if I ever were to actually start writing this as-yet incomplete story idea of mine}

  They are also prone to violence (yes, Draco deserved it, but they attacked him on multiple occasions (Hermion punched him for example!)) instead of looking for other solutions!
#+end_quote

Well, she punched him in the movie. In the book, she slapped him - though that doesn't really change anything, and let's face it, Malfoy completely deserved that. Then, speaking of Hermione, there's the incident with the birds in /OotP/.

  I love Slytherin Harry fics where he has to fight for his place (and has setbacks!)
#+end_quote

Oh, I definitely agree, and that's something I'd like to cover if I ever write this; Harry ends up stuck in Slytherin, with most of the House including its Head being so prejudiced against him that he has to struggle to fit in and fight for his place.
