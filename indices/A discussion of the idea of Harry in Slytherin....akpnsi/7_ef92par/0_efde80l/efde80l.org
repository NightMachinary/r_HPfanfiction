There's a (so far) decent Hufflepuff Harry fic on Potions and Sniches titled "Odd Wizards" by Timorous, but 1. there is only one chapter so far (sep.2018) and 2. the site itself has to do with Harry & Snape so all stories on there have to have (at some point) those two be main characters. No romance though, and you can sort by the kind of Snape you want, so if you want him to be a complete ass you can use that flare. I don't even think their relationship has to be amicable, I read one where Snape's mean/asshole attitude towards Harry was absolutely vile and over the top and it was...something else.

Just a heads up in case you're not a fan of Snape & Harry stories (again, never romantic)
