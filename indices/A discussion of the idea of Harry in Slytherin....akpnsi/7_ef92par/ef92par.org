The problem with Slytherin stories, besides the fact that they play into the tired (Gryff good/Slytherin bad or Slytherin good/Gryff stupid) trope is that many of the older years are going to have parents or relatives who were locked up or killed during the first war with Voldemort. And yet almost always, Harry is semi-widely accepted or doesn't have a hard time or he can't find a single person to bond with

It's why Mira Mirth's story was good, because they showed that weird balance where he befriended Millie and Blaise, who had their own reasons for not falling completely in line with the rest of the house and he had to walk a fine line in his house. You may wish to try With a Forked Tongue, I Lie in Wait, which also shows an interesting balance although Snape is out of character nice towards Harry.

I always thought it would be interesting to see a Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw Harry, tbh. I never really saw any cunning, unlike Hermione, but he has almost blind loyalty.
