Too original to the point where it's no longer Harry Potter? Sure.

I'm struggling to think of how it could be too well-written though. At first I thought of something that is too hard for a non-native reader like me to follow. But then my understanding of well-written is that the prose doesn't get in the way of the story. It should be /easy/ to follow, not hard.
