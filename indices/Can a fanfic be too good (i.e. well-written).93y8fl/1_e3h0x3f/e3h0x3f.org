In a sense, for a sufficiently narrow definition of "well written." Most MFA writing programs workshop/woodshed writers into adopting (almost exclusively) cumulative syntax, which paints a veneer of abstruse literary-fiction-ness over everything and makes stuff read like it's penned by Gertrude Stein or William Gass wannabes.

This doesn't generate page-clicks in fanfiction. Fanfiction readers tend to be drawn to simply told stories with solid story telling, literary comfort food.
