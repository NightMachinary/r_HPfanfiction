The only problem I have with well-written stories is that they've ruined the rest of fanfiction for me. When I first discovered the stuff I'd read just about anything but having experienced the quality of stories written by authors like TheEndless7, Starfox5, White Squirrel, and Rakeesh I can't stomach most ff even as a guilty pleasure.
