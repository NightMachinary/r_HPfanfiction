To be honest, neither can I, but if you would have asked me before the epilogue, I'd certainly given you better odds for Hermione than for Albus Severus.

To be even more frank, I don't see him giving his children any meaningful/legacy name, but if you go with "bravest person", it's either him or Hermione for not breaking under Bellatrix.
