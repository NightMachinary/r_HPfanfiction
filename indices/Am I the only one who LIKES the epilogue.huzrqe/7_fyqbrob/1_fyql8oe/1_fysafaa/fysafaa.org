You must be joking, right? Read the lives stories of couple of double-agents (even on Wikipedia, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du%C5%A1ko_Popov][Tricycle]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Double_agents][Double Agents]]) ... most of them are completely disgusting characters, who are used because they are useful, most of them are completely repulsive.
