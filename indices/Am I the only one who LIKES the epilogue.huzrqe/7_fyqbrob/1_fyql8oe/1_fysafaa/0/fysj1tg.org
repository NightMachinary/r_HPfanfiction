That's not my point. What I meant by that was that why on Earth did he give Snape a second chance if he was repulsed by him? He gave Snape a second chance because he felt like Snape was capable of being given one. Dumbledore definitely wasn't repulsed by Snape by the time PS/SS began. He trusts him with more than his life, and he tells him information that he'd tell /no one else/.
