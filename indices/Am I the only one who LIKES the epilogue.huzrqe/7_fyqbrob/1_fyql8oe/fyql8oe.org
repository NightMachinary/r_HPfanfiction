Geez, you really have it out for Snape, don't you?

*REBUTTAL #1:*

#+begin_quote
  Is part of that lesson honoring the man who put out a hit on you and your father because of his obsession and desire to possess your mother?
#+end_quote

Snape never intended to get Lily to himself -- where's the evidence? If he really /were/ obsessed with Lily, he would've killed himself after she died.

#+begin_quote
  *“I wish...I wish* */I/* *were dead...”*

  “And what use would that be to anyone?” said Dumbledore coldly. “If you loved Lily Evans, if you *truly loved her*, then your way forward is clear.”
#+end_quote

If he truly /didn't/ love her, he would've broken his word. He would've taken the easy way out and committed suicide. But he didn't, because he /loved/ her, and he wanted to protect her son to honor her memory. If he were /obsessed/ with her like you claim, then he wouldn't have cared for her son's safety. He would've just cared for his own needs and his own wants. He would've been selfish. Instead, he listened to Dumbledore and committed the rest of his life to atone for his mistakes. There is no evidence of him stalking, bothering, obsessing over, or watching Lily creepily after she broke their friendship. As far as we know, he left her alone for their last two years at Hogwarts. He even refers to her as Lily /Potter/, not Evans, because he has /moved on/.

#+begin_quote
  “I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily *Potter's* son safe."
#+end_quote

A lot of people confuse his obsession with his guilt for an obsession with Lily. I assure you, if Lily had lived, he would've found another woman to marry sometime afterwards. He would've moved on from his love, and he would've been happy.

  Come to think of it, Snape is ALSO the reason that Neville was (basically) orphaned as well; Voldemort never gets the Prophecy without Snape running off to tattle as soon as he can.
#+end_quote

Snape is /not at all/ responsible for Neville's parents' insanity. It also has /nothing/ to do with the prophecy. Neville's parents were tortured /after/ Voldemort's first demise. The torture was done by Bellatrix Lestrange, Rodolphus Lestrange, Rabastan Lestrange, and Barty Crouch, Jr. in an attempt to locate Voldemort. Don't place blame on a man who had no control over what those vile Death Eaters did. Please, /please/ don't.

  You also brush off his abuse - not bullying, straight up abuse - of generations of students, none of whom Snape had any deep attachment to.
#+end_quote

I understand your hatred for Snape, but where's the proof that he abused "generations of students, none of whom Snape had any deep attachment to"? There were /five/ Weasleys before Ron who had him as a teacher, /none/ of whom came out emotionally battered. For crying out loud, Bill became a /Curse-Breaker/, which is a very, /very/ difficult job to get which requires an O.W.L. in Arithmancy and a N.E.W.T. in Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration, Ancient Runes, and /Potions/! George and Fred spent time inventing different candies and other things which would require a high potion-making ability, and they opened up a joke shop which /rivaled/ Zonko's. Tonks is another proof of his good teaching -- /she/ wasn't emotionally battered by him, either, during school (though he /was/ cruel to her about her love for Remus, but that isn't the issue here), and she ended up becoming an excellent Auror. The only students that he actually tormented in the series were Harry for his resemblance to his father, Hermione for her constant need to answer questions in class, and Neville because he could've /also/ been the Chosen One. Otherwise, no one else was strictly "abused" by him.

*REBUTTAL #4:*

#+begin_quote
  How about when Snape was confronted by Sirius, an innocent man who had spent a decade in prison accused of a crime Snape himself (but not Sirius) was guilty of - namely, betraying the Potters to Voldemort - and straight up tried to have him murdered because they didn't get along in school.
#+end_quote

Snape wanted Sirius killed because he /genuinely believed/ that Sirius betrayed the Potters. He thought Pettigrew was dead, and he wasn't conscious when Remus explained his life story to the Golden Trio. Sirius isn't innocent, either, you know. He thoughtlessly put Remus's life in danger by pranking Snape. In the series, he never apologizes for putting Snape's life in danger (which is understandable due to his hatred), nor does he apologize for for nearly getting Remus killed (which is /not/ understandable at /all/). Yes, Snape acted pretty stupidly, but Sirius should've at /least/ thought about his friend's life when luring Snape into the Whomping Willow. He is /also/ not responsible for betraying the Potters -- that was the rat, Peter Pettigrew.

*REBUTTAL #5:*

#+begin_quote
  Snape wanted a woman, and was willing to murder her infant son and husband to get her.
#+end_quote

Where. Is. The proof? /How/ was Snape supposed to know that Voldemort would take a prophecy so seriously? /How/ was /he/ supposed to know that he'd target Lily Potter's child? He was just following his master's orders. Nothing else, nothing more. When he realized his mistake, he immediately went to Dumbledore. Snape asking Voldemort to spare Lily actually /saved/ Harry's life, because Voldemort giving Lily the option to live gave her the opportunity to make a loving sacrifice, which in turn protected Harry for the next sixteen years of his life. If Snape had asked Voldemort for anything more than that, then Snape would've /surely/ been killed right then and there, and /then/ what would've happened? Harry would've died, and the Harry Potter series wouldn't exist.

  Snape is an irredeemable figure, one that even Dumbledore was repulsed by.
#+end_quote

If Dumbledore was repulsed by Snape, why on Earth did he enlist him as a spy? Why did he trust Snape so much? If Dumbledore was repulsed, then he /wouldn't/ have given Snape a second chance. He would've rejected him on that windy night on the hilltop. Just because Dumbledore said that Snape disgusted him /once/ doesn't mean that he was repulsed by him throughout the /whole series/.
