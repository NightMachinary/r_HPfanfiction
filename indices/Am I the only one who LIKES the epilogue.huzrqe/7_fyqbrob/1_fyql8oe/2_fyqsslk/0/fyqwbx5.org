Ok lmao I'm extremely tired of seeing people repeat the point about Snape being Neville's boggart. The whole point of the boggart is it shows the representation of the fears. Let's look at lupin's boggart shall we? It's a moon. Going by your logic, the moon must have done something to lupin? What did the moon ever do to him? Did it hit him, attack him? Is lupin scared of the full moon itself? Obviously no right? He's scared of what the full moon /represents/ to him. He's scared of the fact that on the full moon he turns into a werewolf and cannot control himself.

Likewise Neville's boggart is Snape because Neville has confidence issues because since young his family has doubted his wizarding abilities, and Snape does the same thing to him by intimidating him and belittling him. So Neville's fear is being a subpar wizard who messes up stuff, it's not “Snape is his literal fear”.

The choice to go into the shrieking shack was Snape's choice yes but who the hell gave Sirius any authority to let out the secret on how to access the whomping willow? Snape doesn't know the exact dangers of being with a werewolf, he has suspicions on remus being a werewolf but he /doesn't/ know that remus IS a werewolf. There's a big difference between both. Snape has suspicions but there was a chance that whatever that was in the shrieking shack could have been anything else but a blood thirsty werewolf. Putting the blame on Snape is purely victim blaming. I don't see anyone calling out Sirius for abusing his remus' trust? By outing remus' secret to Snape? Now that was a mega dick move.

And also at first yes dumbledore did emotionally manipulate Snape because he was a valuable tool but obviously as shown in the books dumbledore grows to trust Snape that he would call for Snape when his life was in danger and that he would tell such an impt secret on Harry being a horcrux to ONLY Snape and not anyone else.
