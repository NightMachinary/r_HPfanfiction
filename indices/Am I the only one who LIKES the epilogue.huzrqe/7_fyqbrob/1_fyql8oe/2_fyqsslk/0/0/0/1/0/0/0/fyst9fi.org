The difference between Snape and a normal person is that Harry is living proof that he fucked up royally. On top of that, he lost his best friend to his worst enemy. Not many people have to go through that. With those two things in mind, it's understandable why he hated Harry. I don't excuse his behavior at all, but it's somewhat understandable.
