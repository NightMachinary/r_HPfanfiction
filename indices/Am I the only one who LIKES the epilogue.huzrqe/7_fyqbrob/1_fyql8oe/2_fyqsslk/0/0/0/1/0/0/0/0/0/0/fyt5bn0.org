Dumbledore is more complicated.

1. First it is really difficult to disentangle real Dumbledore from the fanon one (manipulative!Dumbledore, evil!Dumbledore). There is so much of the latter and so much Dumbles-bashing, that it is sometime difficult to find the Rowling's one.

2. I have actually more understanding for poor judgements of his when he was /de facto/ leader in the civil war. It is really rough job, and no one gets out of this job blameless, because all of them must make decisions which are quite questionable. I do believe that Winston Churchill was one of the biggest leaders of the twentieth century, and yet I still can understand the statement that if he was not the winner of the Second World War, he would be executed as the war criminal (mainly for the style of the air campaign against Germany in the later parts of the war). It is really difficult, and the good leader must to some extent forget individual lives for the greater picture.
