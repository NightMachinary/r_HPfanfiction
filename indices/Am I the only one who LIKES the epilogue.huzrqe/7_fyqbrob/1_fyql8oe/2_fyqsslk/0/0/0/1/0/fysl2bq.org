Like I said in another comment, Snape wasn't obligated to /like/ Harry, he was just obligated to protect him. Also, Snape /didn't/ take Harry's childhood away. /That/ was Pettigrew. Once Snape realized his mistake, he immediately went to Dumbledore. Yes, /he/ was the one who delivered the prophecy, but he didn't know who it would target. He didn't even know that Voldemort would take something as stupid as a prophecy so seriously. If Voldemort hadn't taken the prophecy so seriously, then nothing would've happened and Harry and his family would've not been harmed.

If you say that Snape didn't atone for anything, then you're disregarding his /entire/ redemption arc. You're disregarding practically the whole chapter of "The Prince's Tale." Also, Snape didn't try to "shit all over Harry's father" as he was dying. He just said, "Look...at...me..."

The reason why he spied was /because/ he wanted to atone for his mistakes. If he didn't want to atone for his mistakes, he would have killed himself in November of 1981 like he had initially wanted to.

Lastly, for your information, I read the books /first/, then watched the movies. Before I even watched the first movie, I determined in my own brain that Snape did, in fact, redeem himself, and that he was a good character.
