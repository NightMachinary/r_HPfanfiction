I'm actually a little concerned about Harry's idolization of Dumbledore. Dumbledore was very manipulative and secretive, and he let Harry believe that he was going to survive the war based on a guess. A guess! With Snape, you more or less knew his intentions and his character (even though he was a quadruple agent for the Light). Dumbledore lied to Harry about very important things in his life (such as his survival), while Snape never lied to him at all.
