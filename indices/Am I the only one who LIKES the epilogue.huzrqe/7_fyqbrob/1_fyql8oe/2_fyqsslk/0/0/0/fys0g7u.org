Don't insult people in your rebuttals. That's not a very kind thing to do. Snape is /not/ a serial child abuser. He only tormented /three/ people in the entire HP series, and those people are Harry, Neville, and Hermione. Otherwise, everyone else just finds him unpleasant and rude. Do you see any of the five Weasleys before Ron who had Snape as a teacher crying in the halls, wailing about how /evil/ Snape is? No! In fact, it's probable that Fred, George, and Bill particularly might've /liked/ him a little bit since all of their jobs require them to be adept at potions, and he was their potions teacher. Tonks also had no problem with Snape (except when he tried to discourage her love for Remus). Is /she/ psychologically damaged? Hell no! She's a perfectly capable Auror (a job which /also/ requires you to be adept at potion-making)! The problem is that we see Snape from Harry's POV, and Harry hates Snape to an almost unreasonable degree, so unreasonable that even /Lupin/ calls him out on it!

No one is saying that Snape is perfect or saintly, but he's not evil, either. How /could/ he be when he sacrificed the last seventeen years of his life to atone for his biggest regret?
