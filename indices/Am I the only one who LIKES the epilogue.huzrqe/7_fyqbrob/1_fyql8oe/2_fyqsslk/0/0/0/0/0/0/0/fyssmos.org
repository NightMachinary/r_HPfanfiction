Snape's first words to Harry: “Potter! What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”

In Victorian flower language, this translates to, “I bitterly regret Lily's death.”

So, if you think about it, Snape's first words to Harry in class are an apology. That /has/ to be counted for something.
