Who is insulting? There are people in the HP fandom that really get off to Snape molesting Harry or Hermione. It's not a big leap to assume someone that has responded to /every single/ negative comment about Snape in this thread likely falls into those ranks.

You don't know who Snape tormented or didn't. He was a teacher who belittled his students on a regular basis. That is abuse, given his position of authority. The older Weasleys warned the younger students, so it is pretty much a given that he was a piece of shit to everyone, just not quite as bad he was to H/N/Hr. And Harry is a /child/ who has been abused by an authority figure. He is allowed to hate Snape. What is the excuse for the man in his mid-30s to act that way towards a defenseless little boy?

He never atoned for shit. If he had, he would have fessed up to Harry right away how he was the one responsible for Harry's childhood being stolen from him. Even as he was dying, Snape still tried to shit all over Harry's father. You know that horrible people can still fight for the 'good' side, right? Just because Snape spied for the OOTP, doesn't mean he atoned for anything.

Tell you what - wait til you have childen, then go back and re-read (yes, /read/, not watch) the parts where Snape interacts with kids. Then come back to me and tell me all about how he is just 'complicated' and 'did his best', imagining that he treated your innocent and vulnerable 11 year old that way.
