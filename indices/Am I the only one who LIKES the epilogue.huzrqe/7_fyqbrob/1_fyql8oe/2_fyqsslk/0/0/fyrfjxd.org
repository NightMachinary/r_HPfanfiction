Perhaps people keep mentioning the boggart because you are /wrong/. It isn't metaphorical, it is your greatest fear. Harry is afraid of dementors, Ron is afraid of spiders, Remus is afraid of full moons.

It's okay that you think Snape is perfect and absolutely saintly, but don't expect the rest of us to cream our pants the way you do for a serial child abuser....
