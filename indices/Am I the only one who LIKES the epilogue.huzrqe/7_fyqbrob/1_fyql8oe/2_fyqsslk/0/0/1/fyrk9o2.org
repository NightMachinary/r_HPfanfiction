The thing is fears aren't /literal/ all the time. They can be metaphorical. Hermione's fear is Mcgonagall telling her she failed her exams. So she's scared of failure not of mcgonagall is she? And Ron's fear as a spider is very literal but remus' fear of the full moon is not literal in my opinion. Because he's scared of turning into the werewolf he's not scared of the full moon itself literally.

Boggarts show your worst fears yes true. What would it show for someone who has a fear of heights? For someone who is claustrophobic? Someone who is scared of being alone? Some fears cannot be shown literally can they?

And also no one is saying he's perfect and do we have to resort to insulting? Really...
