And fears are often a way more complicated. It was some Harmony story (obviously) which explained that she knew if she failed Hogwarts, she would be obliviated of all magical knowledge, her wand would be snapped, and she would have to return to the Muggle world, where she was hated and belittled by her stupid peers. Perhaps, the idea she could ever fail at Hogwarts is ridiculous, but as I said fear is usually not rational. What I want to say is that there are stories behind our fears and they are usually a way more complicated than what's seen on the first look.
