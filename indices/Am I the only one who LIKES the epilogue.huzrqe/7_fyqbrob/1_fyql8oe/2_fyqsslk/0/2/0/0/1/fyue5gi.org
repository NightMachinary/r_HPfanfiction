Interesting! Snape was always trying to protect people's lives, but doesn't really care for their welfare lmao. But I would like to believe it's just coincidence Neville, Luna and Ginny are all pure bloods, if it had been Colin or some other muggleborn I believe he would have still sent them to the Forbidden forest. Cos I feel that if Snape still had any lingering favoritism to purebloods dumbledore wouldn't have trusted him that much you know?
