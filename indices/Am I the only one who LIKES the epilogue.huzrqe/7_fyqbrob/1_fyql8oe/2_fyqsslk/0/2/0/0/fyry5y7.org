You're right, actually! Snape never, EVER put Neville's life in danger. He just verbally undermined him. When Snape was Headmaster, he saved Neville, Ginny, and Luna by giving them detention with Hagrid after they tried to steal the Sword of Gryffindor. Did you notice that Neville, Ginny, and Luna are all pureblood, so that's why Snape could give them the leniency? That's a fun easter egg.
