Look, the fact that Snape is Neville's boggart alone should be enough to tell the tale about his teaching style. I mean, Neville could have feared the death of his parents or them never getting better, or maybe Bellatrix Lestrange, the one truly dangerous death Eater who was amongst those who tortured his parents into the state they were. But no, Snape it is. That tells you just how much psychological damage he did.

Except that the call to go there was entirely Snape's decision, and he suspected that Lupin was a werewolf, his conversation with Lily says as much. It was a dick move towards Lupin for the damage Snape could have done to his reputation and future at Hogwarts, but any danger Snape found himself in was entirely on himself.

  A lot of people confuse his obsession with his guilt for an obsession with Lily. I assure you, if Lily had lived, he would've found another woman to marry sometime afterwards. He would've moved on from his love, and he would've been happy.

There's not one bit of evidence that he had or would have moved on, only your conjecture.

  If Dumbledore was repulsed, then he wouldn't have given Snape a second chance.

Why throw away a useful tool? Everyone was quite happy to gobble up Nazi scientists after the war, even if they were involved in questionable actions. Dumbledore keeping Snape around makes sense, you don't have to like someone to take advantage of them. In fact, it makes it easier.
