Is part of that lesson honoring the man who put out a hit on you and your father because of his obsession and desire to possess your mother? Let's not forget that Snape is the primary reason Harry was orphaned to begin with. Come to think of it, Snape is ALSO the reason that Neville was (basically) orphaned as well; Voldemort never gets the Prophecy without Snape running off to tattle as soon as he can. How does he atone for his crime to Neville? Oh, by torturing him so much that Neville's greatest fear was Snape himself.

How about when Snape was confronted by Sirius, an innocent man who had spent a decade in prison accused of a crime Snape himself (but not Sirius) was guilty of - namely, betraying the Potters to Voldemort - and straight up tried to have him murdered because they didn't get along in school. Picture yourself at age 30, and a kid you fought with in high school willingly trying to send you to the electric chair for a crime he knows you didn't commit. What a /psychopath!/

You also brush off his abuse - not bullying, straight up abuse - of generations of students, none of whom Snape had any deep attachment to. In other words, he emotionally battered a bunch of children he had control over for no reason beyond it was the kind of shit he got off on.

I get you're trying to look deeper into the meaning of the series as a whole, but Snape is an irredeemable figure, one that even Dumbledore was repulsed by. He was as big a villain as Voldemort in my opinion, because his motivations were so much more grotesque than Voldemort's. LV just wanted control of the wizarding world to make it (in his mind) better. Snape wanted a woman, and was willing to murder her infant son and husband to get her. Lily really lucked out that Voldemort killed her, saving her from a life where Snape was always just around the corner with (potentially) a potion or a memory charm. /shudder/ My favorite part of DH was Snape dying slowly. A Killing Curse is too quick and painless for someone as monstrous as him.
