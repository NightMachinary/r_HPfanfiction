some of this is silly

snape didn't put a hit on james & harry to 'possess' lily. he didn't know who the prophecy would target. nor were his following actions ever about 'possessing' her. he wanted to save her life, & was willing to sacrificing his own life & freedom to make it happen

  he knows you didn't commit

he didn't know that. he believed, understandably, that sirius was guilty, & the testimony of 3 children & his close friend who kept the knowledge of his being an animagus a secret all year, & who he knows has a history of turning a blind eye to sirius' unscrupulous behaviour, was untrustworthy

dumbledore was repulsed by his casual disregard for human life when he was 21. he also thinks highly of his capacity for love, & courage. & u know. lets snape do whatever he wants

  LV just wanted control of the wizarding world to make it (in his mind) better.

what lol. voldemort cares only about his own power & glorification. by this warped logic, snape only wanted what was best for lily & the wizarding world (in his mind)
