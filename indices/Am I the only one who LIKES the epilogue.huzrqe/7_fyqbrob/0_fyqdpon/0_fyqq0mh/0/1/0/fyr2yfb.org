Um sorry what are you trying to say about Peter? I mean what point are you trying to put across by saying that he could have lived the entire life as a rat? And yes he aids in death eater activity by helping Voldemort get a body? I mean that's a pretty big activity.

Ok his atonement is for indirectly being a part of Lily's death. He isn't atoning for being a dick to his students.

But Snape wasn't wholly responsible for Harry and Neville's family situation. Snape did pass the prophecy but Voldemort is the one who chose to act on it and Peter was the one who betrayed the Potters. And bellatrix out of her own volition tortures the Longbottoms. It feels like the person who was directly responsible for these crimes are never called out for it but Snape gets all the blame? I mean if you're gonna mention Snape then please do mention Voldemort, Peter, Bellatrix also.

And also please the whole boggart thing again. Boggart are representations of fears they aren't “literal fears”. So if Hermione's boggart is a grade card with Fs then it means she's scared of failure. Not scared of grade cards. Neville's fears are being an inadequate wizard not Snape.

Whether he's redeemed or not is not the point, it's about realizing your mistake and atoning for it. He did sacrifice his life for the wizarding world and also saved a lot of people along the way like Katie Bell, all the petrified students in CoS (he brewed the mandrake potion), saved Draco's soul etc
