  To a certain degree, he must have believed it.

That is true he did not have an favorable opinion of muggles and if he was so vehemently against muggleborn disrcrimination then he would not have joined the DEs.

And by ootp I meant the organization! Or actually more like the Light side. In that scene yes Lily stands up for him and is the only one to stand up for him. But then we've got the marauders bullying him for the laughs as well. And well we can consider the marauders and lily to be on the light side and so when snape's got only 1 person for him and you've got 3 who's against him since day 1. Now would Snape join a group that has people who really don't like him and he also hates them?

What I meant by ‘expressing an interest' was basically to butter him up. It's like if you want to recruit somebody you've got to treat them well right? And it's a war and there seems to be strong propaganda from the DEs side because they have a higher follower count than OOTP. So did the light side lack the resources for it lmao? But I guess ootp wanted people who truly believed in their cause and not just there because propaganda so that's understandable.

And regarding the convo bwt Snape and lily in Prince's tale, lily does point out that Snape's slytherin friends do some bad shit for laughs (and doesn't mention about the marauders doing bad shit for laughs) and Snape is like why just point out only my slytherin friends, the Gryffindors also do that (like almost leading Snape to his death in the shrieking shack lmao). I mean in this case both the slytherins and Gryffindors engage in shitty acts against others. And both Snape and lily were being biased towards their own houses, which is understandable because they spend more time with their housemates. And lily doesn't /deny/ that what the marauders do is also shitty just like snape's slytherin friends, the only thing she says in defense of them is ‘they don't use dark magic'. Which is partially untrue because when Harry and his friend are doing detentions in the record room or something they find detention records of the marauders stating that they used a illegal hex. So maybe they didn't use dark magic per say but used illegal magic . Both of their statements are equally valid and true and if you're going to say Snape was making excuses and shifting blame around then lily was doing the same.
