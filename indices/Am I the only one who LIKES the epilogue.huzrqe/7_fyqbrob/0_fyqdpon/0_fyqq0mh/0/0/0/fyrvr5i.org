I view it as his greatest regret was that he was an indirect cause to Lily's death. So whatever that led up to it he would have thought of as a mistake, like joining the DEs and associating with Voldemort.

If lily wasn't targeted then it's honestly 50/50 on whether he would have defected eventually. Because no one knows if Lily being a target is the tipping point for Snape or is the primary reason for defecting from the DEs. It can be argued either way but talking about this is gonna get us nowhere because of no solid evidence.

The thing is short of Voldemort giving an unbreakable vow to Snape, nothing in Voldemort's character suggests that he is trustworthy and is one who keeps his promises. So Voldemort will never give any guarantee he will do as he wishes. As a DE Snape would have noticed and observed that. That's why he goes to dumbledore to ensure the Potters' safety because he definitely knows Voldemort will never ensure Lily's safety.

I think what you're trying to insinuate is that Snape only changed sides when someone he loved was threatened and didn't think about the other muggleborns therefore he's a selfish person. But I'll challenge you to find me one character from the hp series that has no personal motivations in this war and is taking part in the war on the light side for noble and non-selfish reasons. Everyone one from Harry to the Weasleys all have personal motivations.

Even dumbledore was friends with Grindelwald and believed in his motto until Ariana died when he realized that he's on the wrong path. And after that he atones for it by defeating grindelwald and shunning away from positions of major power like being a Minister. Making mistakes is a human thing, that's how you know you're doing wrong. But after that you cannot just wallow about it, you have to take steps to correct it.

Which is what Snape does by going to dumbledore and promising anything in exchange for the Potters' safety. The only person he blamed was himself, there's no other evidence of him blaming anyone else?
