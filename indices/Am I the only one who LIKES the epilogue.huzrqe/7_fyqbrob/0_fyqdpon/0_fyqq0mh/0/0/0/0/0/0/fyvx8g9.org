  So my view is that he's not someone who's into the beliefs and motto of a group, he's just in it for himself because someone wants him. So I don't see him believing all the pureblood propaganda, he's just there because they recognize his talents.

To a certain degree, he must have believed it. He definitely thought Muggles were worse than wizards and not worthy of attention. It's clear from the way he treated Petunia.

I think you mean the memory Harry saw in OOtP. If so, then someone expressed interest in him - it was Lily, who stood up for him.

  With regards to Prince's tale, I mean he was apologizing for his mistake and he does own up to it, it's natural to say stupid stuff when they are angry,humiliated but he does apologize for it, so I'm not sure what you mean? when they are both talking about James and lupin which part of the convo are you referring to when you say he's making excuses?

It was before he called her 'Mudblood'. They were talking about his friends, and Lily said they are terrible and asked him why he hangs out with Avery and Mulciber when they are creepy. Snape says they do all this shit for laughs, and when she points out it was dark magic, he turns the conversation around and starts talking about the Marauders and how they sneak out because Lupin is a werewolf.
