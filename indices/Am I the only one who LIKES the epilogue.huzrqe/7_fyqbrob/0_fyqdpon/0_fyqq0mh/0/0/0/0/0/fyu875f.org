Personally my view is that Snape joined the DEs to gain power to make up for the powerlessness he felt during his teens. I think he wanted to be recognized and celebrated, instead of ignored and bullied and will thrive under someone who gives him the attention and validation he craves. So whoever appreciates his talents he's gonna be on their side, and he's not inclined to care about the others because who cared for him when he was in need? He definitely has a me against the world mindset. If someone in ootp had expressed interest in him he would have been swayed to their side. So my view is that he's not someone who's into the beliefs and motto of a group, he's just in it for himself because someone wants him. So I don't see him believing all the pureblood propaganda, he's just there because they recognize his talents. But once he realizes that he's not getting what he wanted, he would be more inclined to leave the DEs I think.

Actually yeah Aberforth definitely has nothing to gain personally I mean defeating the DEs would mean not much business to his shop lmao. And it's not as if he really believes in all the stuff albus says but I think he's the kind to look out for the underdog and help those who are in need. Kudos to you! I definitely didn't think of this lmao

Slughorn I think was content to sit out the war it's more oopsie guess I'm stuck in the middle of this battle might as well try my best to protect the students. Kinda like a reluctant fighter.

My view was that Snape treated Harry badly because of him looking like James. Snape's triggers seems to be the marauders, just looking at them seems to make him on edge. For Neville it's because he's already a anxious boy normally and with someone like Snape his anxiety like skyrockets so he ends up doing even more mistakes and that just sets Snape off even more. I mean he hates Gryffindors in general but I think he also hates students who messes up the tasks he sets.

With regards to Prince's tale, I mean he was apologizing for his mistake and he does own up to it, it's natural to say stupid stuff when they are angry,humiliated but he does apologize for it, so I'm not sure what you mean? when they are both talking about James and lupin which part of the convo are you referring to when you say he's making excuses?

He does have a pretty unlikable demeanor and if I ever had a teacher like that boy would I dislike his classes. But looking into his backstory did change my view on him because a lot of his actions required great inner strength and sacrifice and I do admire that.
