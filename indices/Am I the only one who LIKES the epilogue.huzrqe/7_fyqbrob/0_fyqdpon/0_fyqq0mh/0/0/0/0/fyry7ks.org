Yeah, I get what you mean, and sure, we don't know, maybe Snape would defect, maybe. Personally, I just doubt that.

And sure, the Order fought for people they loved, but it wasn't the only reason why, and with Snape..., I never really saw a proof that he stopped believing in the pureblood propaganda. Though it has been some time since I read the books, so maybe I just don't remember.

  I'll challenge you to find me one character from the hp series that has no personal motivations in this war and is taking part in the war on the light side for noble and non-selfish reasons. Everyone one from Harry to the Weasleys all have personal motivations.

Okay, I may be completely wrong, but I would point at Aberforth. His family is dead, and his relationship with Albus was rather frosty, judging from his speech in DH. His pub is doing well despite the obvious presence of death-eaters...

Also, Slughorn maybe too? I mean, we got that speech how he's afraid of Voldemort in HBP, but in DH he's teaching at Hogwarts without any problems. And McGonagall tells him it's time for Slytherin to choose sides, so I assume, he could go with his students, but he stayed.

I mean, not perfect examples, but not everyone was fighting for their lives or the life of someone they loved.

  Which is what Snape does by going to dumbledore and promising anything in exchange for the Potters' safety. The only person he blamed was himself, there's no other evidence of him blaming anyone else?

It is my interpretation, but I always thought that one of the reasons why Snape was so horrible to Harry was because Lily died, trying to save him. And the same with Neville, I think he bullied Neville because Neville was the other boy that fit the prophecy.

Also, The Prince's Tale when he's apologizing to Lily or trying to convince her that James is bad and Lupin is a werewolf are good examples of Snape making excuses for his actions, not owning his mistakes, and turning the blame on other people.

But like I said, it's mostly my interpretation of Snape's character, and I admit that I honestly think he was a horrible human being. An interesting character, and probably one of the most complex characters in the books, but I despise him and his behaviour.
