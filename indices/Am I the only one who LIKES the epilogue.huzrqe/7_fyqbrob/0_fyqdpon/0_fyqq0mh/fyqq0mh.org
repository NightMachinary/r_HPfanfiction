Ah yes, because making a random family the target of a mass murderer is much better, especially if you voluntarily joined him. I honestly have more respect for Pettigrew than for Snape, not that this is a high bar, but Pettigrew joined out of fear, Snape out of conviction.

Especially since his stance had cost Snape Lily's friendship, and yet he went further down that path rather than turning around and trying to change for the better.
