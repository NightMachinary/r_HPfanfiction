It's not that I don't like the contents of the epilogue itself, I just feel it was way too much of a time jump. JKR basically locked herself out of any potential follow-up material by skipping so far ahead (resulting in the atrocity known as the cursed child), and the jump from a boarding school trope to married with three kids just doesn't seem fitting. Would've been much better to write it like a year or so afterwards, showing what the characters went off to do after Voldemort's fall. Imo, anyway.

That being said, if I do write something that involves an adult Harry, either he has no children or I make OC children because the names just feel too cheesy to me. Especially Lily /Luna/.
