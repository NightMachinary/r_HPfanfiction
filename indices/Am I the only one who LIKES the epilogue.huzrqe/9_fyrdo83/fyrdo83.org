I like the epilogue. I also think the names reflect how Harry felt about Albus and Severus, rather than what the reader thinks. I don't mind 'what if' fics where the story diverges earlier.

There's plenty of literacy criticism for books that try to moralise stories for children, of course. The best children's stories let children think for themselves - for the most part HP does.
