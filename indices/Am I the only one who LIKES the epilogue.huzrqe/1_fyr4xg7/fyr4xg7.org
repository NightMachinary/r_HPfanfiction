I don't like the Snape apologies that sound like “an adult man in a position of power verbally abusing his students from his teachers position is a good man”. There's a BIG difference between respecting someone for their sacrifices and naming your children after them.

News flash!! You CAN hold mixed emotions for people who have hurt you. I just don't think a man bullying a girl into changing her teeth, or ignoring ongoing harassment incidents, or the entirety of the Occlumency lessons? No matter how he's looked at, he is still a man with DEEPLY ROOTED ISSUES with no intent on changing his bedside manner to any kind of professionalism with his students. I'm not happy.

You can like Snape for being a complex and complicated man, but draw the line at Good, because that's not happening. And naming his son “Albus Severus” is like saying that as long as a toxic adult means well, that excuses their prior actions or behavior.

Harry kept his own cousin at “Christmas card” length and probably never spoke to his aunt and uncle again. Why would Snape have been an exception if he lived? Why did Snape deserve that distinction?

And by the way... “they're meant to teach us a lesson”? Maybe I just wanted a single adult to take responsibility for a change. Forgiveness should be earned, not freely given. The whole magical society turned against children. Two grown man discussed Harry's impending sacrifice of life. A kid learned to fight dementors, giant snakes, and terrorists before ever reaching the age to legally drive. A man put a stone of immortality behind a door that could be easily unlocked, with traps children could solve. A grown adult was never able to put his personal issues aside long enough to put his big boy pants on and establish a rapport with the “boy who literally is being targeted by a dark lord”. You don't need to like a child to still act like an adult for them. That's it.
