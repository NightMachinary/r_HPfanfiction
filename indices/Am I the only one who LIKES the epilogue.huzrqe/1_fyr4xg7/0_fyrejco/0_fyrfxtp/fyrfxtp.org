It's actually just sad. Turning into an adult looking back at the series from this stand point? A human who is older then Lily and James when they died? Just reinforces that idea that Harry needed better adults in his life.

It's not okay that the kind or people he idealizes as heroes are some of the most substantial in not being substantial. They're valid humans with flaws, but it almost misses its own self awareness in favor of rose shades and memories of Lilly that, instead of creating some fond attachment to Snape's life, make me more infuriated that sharing those memories with Harry was not a viable concept until he was literally DYING. It was never purely for Harry's sake. If Snape died alone...

And that's okay. It just needs to be acknowledged.
