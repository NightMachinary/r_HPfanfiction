I agree. I was thinking earlier how young I was at 21. I'm only a few years older now, but you mature so much in those early years of adulthood. It's like looking at the graves of soldiers in WW1 (we have lots in the nearby graveyard).

In many ways, I find it more concerning that Harry idolises Dumbledore than Snape; Snape, at least, fundamentally disagreed with the idea of sacrifice. Dumbledore was willing to bank on an guess - whoever educated - that everyone would behave exactly as predicted for Harry to choose life. Even if Dumbledore knew with certainty, the experience was traumatising. Dumbledore also ensures that Harry alienates himself from any of the adults who wanted to help.

Harry really did need better adults. From an adult perspective its worrying that even a child in as obvious circumstances his weren't supported at all at Hogwarts. McGonagall already knew the Dursleys were a terrible choice to raise a child, knew they spoilt their son and yet Harry came to Hogwarts in oversized casual clothes, without a Hogsmeade note and with no response to letters regarding his behaviour or - presumably - to his stays in the hospital wing.

Also, I was just checking up on how old Petunia Dursley was Harry was dropped on her doorstep. It's not clear, just pre-1960 though I imagine not much older given that she wrote to Dumbledore at one point. She was told to bank on some form of magic (knowing her sister had died despite having magic to defend herself) to keep her family safe. Whilst also knowing that this terrorist specifically wanted to rid the world of 'normal people' with personal murderous intentions towards her nephew.

Oh, and she can't tell anyone about this. Dumbledore said he knew Harry would be unhappy there, but never actually makes an effort to mediate this position. At the very least, he should have had the discussion in person to answer any of her questions. Really, she ought to have been able to decline, given the risks involved.

Obviously, I'm not suggesting any reasonable person would neglect a child but the situation could either have been eased or avoided. Potentially even a bit more testing could have been done regarding how early a month a year could have been exercised.
