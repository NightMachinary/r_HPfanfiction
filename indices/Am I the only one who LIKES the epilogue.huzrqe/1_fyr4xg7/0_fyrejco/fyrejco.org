I put it down to Harry not having a good sense of how adults should behave, so he sees Snape as both a hero (who he is indebted to, who was brave and made great contributions to the war effort, who put himself at risk for Harry/Lily specifically) and the only person who showed him memories of his mother.

I don't think it symbolises forgiveness, myself. I think its meant to show that niceness (or complexity of character) doesn't map onto dedication for the cause. Snape was radicalised as a vulnerable young person and paid for it (ungraciously) for the rest of his life.

I think we don't see his mixed feelings because once you've named your child after someone, you can't then turn around and be like "Yeah, your namesake was an utter bastard who I hated, but he did save my life."
