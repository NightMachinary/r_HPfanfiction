Eh, the epilogue wasn't actually bad. It's mostly a matter of taste, but generally the ones who give shit to the epilogue are mostly upset because their favorite characters didn't live up to their expectations or that some choice or another goes very much against their desires. Cursed Child though is almost universally hated and personally I feel it deserves the flames.

Take Harry for example, his mentor was Dumbledore, who was a brilliant researcher, one of the most powerful wizards of his time and accumulated a great deal of political power, when some see Harry being what amounts to a higher-ranking police-officer while Hermione is Minister they get the sense that he is wasting his potential despite the fact that such a choice is actually very in-character for Harry and that he never was invested in such things as political power, academic achievements or overwhelming power to begin with and actually appears to be quite satisfied with his lot in life.

Then there is the inevitable ship wars, where people get angry that their ships didn't fly, this one is admittedly mostly Harmony vs Hinny, but it's a fact that in popular fandoms many will end displeased over the endgame pairing.

Then there is the whole name business, and there you have to admit that Albus Severus came from left-field, I mean; ignoring the whole “Albus planned Harry's death” since he didn't know about it for time enough to have a deep emotional impact before meeting him and clarifying the issue; Snape is still a character hated by many and considering his mostly negative behavior towards Harry many of us feel that Harry should go tap-dancing over the man's grave weekly, not forgive him, he literally got Harry's parents killed and then spent six years belittling the boy for haven's sake. Plus the name itself is one we have to get used to, Albus Severus Potter (in an open translation: white grumpy potter) just doesn't roll that well on the tongue when compared to many other names used, even Nymphadora Tonks is kind of catchy, Albus Severus though isn't.

Then there is Draco. While they only nodded to each other on the train station the mere fact that Draco was free to marry and have a son at the same year as Harry's second-born was conceived gives the idea of there not having been changes from the status quo. The Malfoys were among Voldemort's most important allies, for them to be in the same situation as Harry gives the sense of impunity, like there weren't consequences for all the crimes they committed. Considering that we see during the books that the Status Quo was rampart discrimination against muggleborns (represented by Hermione who for better or worse is a very beloved character) and the government that thought nothing of torturing kids, being the books' antagonists deeply related with this agents of the Status Quo and having the final battle culminated in the defeated of this agents (Voldemort dead, Narcisa helping Harry, the DEs defeated, a member of the order taking over as minister) this continuity of the Status Quo becomes rather grating, like the conflict wasn't solved.
