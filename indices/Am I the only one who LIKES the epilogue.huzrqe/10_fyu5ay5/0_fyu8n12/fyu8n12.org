I like your explanation very much! I personally hate the Cursed Child because of its character assassinations. Harry, having had many terrible adult figures in his life, would /never/ wish Albus Severus wasn't his son. He'd be grateful that he could even survive to /have/ children. Ron, on the other hand, just becomes a big joke, and Hermione turns into a female version of Snape in the alternate reality. I mean, what the hell? Albus Severus is a total emo and brat, and the only characters I actually /liked/ in the play were Draco and Scorpius. I don't understand why Rose was so mean, either. She took what Ron told her about beating Scorpius too seriously, and in the process, she ruins her friendship with Albus. The other thing I like about the play is Snape's minor role (I might be biased here since Snape is my fav character in the series). He sacrifices himself so that the reality could be restored to its normal state while knowing he'd be dead in the restored reality. The Cursed Child just ruins the whole HP series and makes it into a joke and a travesty. I consider some parts of the Cursed Child canon and other parts not canon (like discounting Harry's bad parenting and counting Snape's redemption). I dunno, I just wanted to provide my opinion on the shit-show.
