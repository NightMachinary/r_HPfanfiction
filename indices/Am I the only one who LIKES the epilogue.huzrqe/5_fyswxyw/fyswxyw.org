Not alone there, I love the epilogue (yes, you may start screaming at me now).

About the name Albus Severus, it never really bothered me. Albus may be questionable from our view of Dumbledore, but for Harry he was a kind of mentor or even very remotely a father-figure, so I do get that name choice. And I think he did admire Snape for his bravery, pulling of what he did eventually to save him. Snape will probably not be acknowledged by many people, on either side, so maybe this was Harry's way of giving one last honor. This is from the view of Harry as a person, but I like your approach from JKs view!
