I don't mind the epilogue, but I think it raises warning signs about Ron and Hermione's relationship. Ron has cheated the muggle government, and is lying to Hermione about doing it, because /in his eyes/ the lie is harmless. Oh, and he also placed a driving test officer in a confused state for an unspecified length of time; there's no real telling what that might have led to after the test was finished. Did the officer even make it home safely afterward?
