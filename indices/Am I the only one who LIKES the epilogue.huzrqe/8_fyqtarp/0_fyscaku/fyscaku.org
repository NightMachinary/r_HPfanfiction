I have problems with Malfoy out of prison too (and with Albus *Severus* Potter), but still “All was well” is the best part of the Epilogue and the perfect conclusion of the whole series. I guess it depends whether you focus on small problems (these two I mentioned and some other ones I haven't) or how it perfectly fulfils the Hero's Journey towards new life and reconciliation with life. I guess, it is the same for the heroes inside of the story, whether they focus on real tragedies in their life (Teddy being an orphan, Fred's dead) or whether they focus on the huge blessings they were given (their own lives, freedom, their own children, etc.). I firmly believe, that all was well after all.
