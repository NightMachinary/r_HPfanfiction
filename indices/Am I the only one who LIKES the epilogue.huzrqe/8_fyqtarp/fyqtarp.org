I could write a lengthy paragraph on why the epilogue sucks, but the "all was well" line alone is enough to rate the whole thing as garbage. The fact that Teddy's parents aren't around to see him off is proof that not all was well, nevermind that Malfoy is out of prison and that long enough to have courted his wife and have an 11 yo son.
