There are slash fics. It's just huge, so you'll have to figure out which authors are the good ones, and then maybe browse through their favorites as well. I know a lot authors post exclusively on there, so it might be worth looking for new fics, but it's definitely not a very slash-searchable site (and less of a slash-writing population compared to say, specific-ship ljs).
