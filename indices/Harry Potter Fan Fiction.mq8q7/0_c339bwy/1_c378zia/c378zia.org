There are /tons/ of slash fics on HPFF, but they can be tricky to find. Your best bet is to use the search form at the bottom of the [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/storytype.php][find a story]] section. Just select your first and second characters (probably whatever two characters you ship) and the genre you want, and it will bring up a selection of stories containing both of those characters. Although you'll also turn up a bunch of stories you're not looking for, it will narrow the results.

Unfortunately, HPFF is tragically difficult to search for same sex pairings. They are, however, here. Maybe we should compile pairing lists for this subreddit, to make these sorts of things easier to find!
