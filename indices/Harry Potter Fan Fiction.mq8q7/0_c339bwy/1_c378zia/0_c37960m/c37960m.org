That's the search method I was using. I didn't find anything last time, although in trying again, I spotted a couple by the third page of results. By then, I'd gone through so many cringe-worthy OC summaries, however, that I was quite turned off fanfiction for a bit.

I think making a thread in this subreddit for each pairing is a good idea.
