I know that one of my favorite Remus/Sirius writers also writes HP/SS. I've never read her HP/SS fics because that pairing seems too weird to me, but I'll bet they're very well written.

[[http://minx.destinysgarden.net/story_index.html][There's more on her masterlist here.]]

Site's clearly old, but it all works. Oh, and the fics are wonderfully smutty, but if that's not your thing, then maybe you shouldn't read them.
