Dramione is my biggest ship (a.k.a. my "I could read and write this all day" ship), but I do like other stuff (including some slash). When I get around to reading it, I always enjoy a good Sirius/Remus fic.

I've never run into any Harry/Severus, but I imagine the dynamic would be fascinating between them. If that's what you're looking for, I know why you're not finding it on HPFF; they have really strict rules about [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/getinfo.php?page=siterules#Disallowed_Ships][professor/student romances]]. Any Harry/Snape slash fiction on HPFF would have to take place after Harry is no longer under Snape's tutelage, which is canonically impossible. Of course, there's always AU!

Although I have found a pretty limited number of actual stories for Runa (Ron/Luna), I've always really thought that they would make a better couple than the canon Romione. Ron is always entertained by her and she asks about him constantly in conversations with Harry. Plus, I just don't think Ron is really bright enough for Hermione, but that's a different story.
