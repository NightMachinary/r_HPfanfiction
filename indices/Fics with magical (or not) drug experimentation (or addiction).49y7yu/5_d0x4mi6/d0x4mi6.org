Coping Methods. linkffn(coping methods by chelseyb). Drug addiction and abuse are the focus of the story. I'm starting to feel like I rec this fic everytime I post...but it fits here perfectly.

Duality. linkffn(7145549). Cigarettes, I think, but not really relevant to the plot iirc. Been a while since I've checked in on that fic. The FFnet version is probably an edited/sanitized version, but potential NSFW content.

I can think of a few more where drugs are mentioned in passing but I think those are the only two where it's the focus or frequently referred to.

Oh, almost forgot. Stages of Hope. linkffn(6892925). Has substance abuse but not of a kind you expect--a magical substance too.
