Blood Magic by GatewayGirl (complete only on Schnoogle, only part is up on ffn) has a bit actually. It's a severitus fic, with a Snape that I quite like the characterization of (it's more book than movie Snape, in that he lashes out rather than being calmly nasty. He's got a beautifully morbid sense of humor too. It was written too early to get Snape's background quite right, but it's closer than most takes, and it's a rather fascinating one). Anyway, there are a few mind altering substances brewed, some by Snape, some by Harry, and a character is mentioned as being addicted to a particularly nasty potion. Some of the drug use is played for humor (and the dialogue is actually brilliant - better than I've seen in many published works), but it's also addressed more seriously. It is novel length, and the drugs are a bit of a running side theme/plot, not the main one. It's one of my favorite old fics.
