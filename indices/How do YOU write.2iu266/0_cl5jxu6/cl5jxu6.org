With great difficulty.

Silliness aside, most of my stuff comes from a random scene popping into my head (for example, what if Hermione accidentally stumbles onto pseudo-Moody's identity whilst in his presence and is caught up in a panicky duel - later Dumbledore sadly announces to the school the tragic accidental death of one Hermione Granger).

From there, I'd backtrack to find the one change that could be made to realistically lead me to that point. Maybe she overhears something she ought not to. Maybe she picks up a bit of Moody trivia that doesn't gel with Crouch, and gets suspicious. Perhaps spending so much time with Harry has caused her to feel things that make her feel conflicted, and is a bit distracted when sitting next to him in Defense; having realized she left her bag behind after class, she leaves her friends and hurries back to retrieve it and arrives right as Moody is taking a swig from his flask, and smells something she remembers from her second year... you get the point.

Then it's just a manner of connecting the dots to get from the divergence point to the scene, and then afterwards just let the characters be the characters and see where it takes you.

...yeah
