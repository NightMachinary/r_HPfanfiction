Depends on what type of story I'm going for, If I want an epic-length, hugely intertwined story from multiple perspectives then I'm going to be thinking /all the time/ about what I could add in a certain place, whilst thinking of other plots that can link them together - with such huge stories you don't really get a choice or easy framework unless you stick closely to canon.

I don't stick to canon... like ever.

How it all could start for me in my head might be an errant thought about /how else/ the canon story might be manipulated - well within the realms of reason, yet still mess things up enough to recreate the world.

The good point is it's your world to mess up in or spend countless hours perfecting its every nuance. The bad thing is that it's /your world now-/, you've changed enough that entire canon plot-lines are /ashes/ and relationships won't come to fruition unless you really put pen to paper or have a genius flash of inspiration that will barrel along your plot quite nicely.

This is how it is for me.

*How I thought of my fanfic before I started note-taking and plotting.*

  /What if the reason seven souls are important is that the other soul pieces become more alive, and desperately want to become whole./

This led me to think of ways I could get Harry to realize this - before I decided to scrap that later on due to the inconvenience it is to have /Voldemort/ as an enemy.

Thus through plotting and semi-serious thought processes I wangled my story down into a BWL!Neville story, with Harry in Hufflepuff and a competent Quirrell to kick-start Harry's training in stupidly simple but utterly practicable aspects of magic.

This doesn't mean I'm making my Quirrell lean backwards twice-over to teach Harry how to control fiendfyre (shudders at fanfic memories). Also while Quirrell is doing his usual unicorn killing he's also reaching out to Snape and Malfoy Sr (Voldemort didn't kill Lily, after all... why should Snape hate him... turn his back on the dark?).

I generally keep a pen and paper around with me to ink down stray thoughts that are so inconsequentially important to developing in a realistic way but I might forget in as soon as five minutes later - things likr

I must let it be known that I really, /really/ like noting down unusual thoughts and recommend straying into strange territory in order to bolster creativity and linking ideas into integral plot points -

#+begin_quote
  /What if Draco Malfoy was the most powerful student in the school - his arrogance at least somewhat earned due to his abilities - scorning his father to say he is the one people should fear, perhaps?/
#+end_quote

Thus we enter a new Hogwarts were arrogant Draco shows off his power with an aura reminiscent of the Dark Lords, he commands the Slytherins, Dumbledore avoids confronting him due to Lucius' political clout, Harry is egged on and defeated, Draco killed by Flitwick after taking it too far and professing his powers as unbeatable, Flitwick goes on rampage, clearing out Death Eater children.

I'd /read/ that. From then on all you have to do is have a Harry who starts strong - don't give him to Ron (the slacker), instead pair him with Dean, who has admirable moral fibre, thus we get a smart and cautious Harry versus overpowered Draco and a militant Slytherin house. From there you go into sub plots; what happens to Lucius? to Dobby? to Hermione? to muggleborns in general? to Neville?

From there you go to the logical response from students - a petition to have Draco expelled, signed by 300 people - not even a meeting with headmaster? twist that story into an anti-Dumbledore, anti-establishment, anti-Slytherin fight to the last man.

--------------

In case you missed it - I gather stray thoughts, compile them into points in my story (e.g. /Book 1= xxx Book 2= xyxxwx/). I move on from there to logical plotting (friends/family/affected individuals-for target or victim perspective), I will have then decided how /vast/ I want my world to be, do I want the ICW? no. Do I want Necromancers? No. Do I want Necromancy? Maybe. Do I want Sirius? No, he was unlawfully sucked of his soul.

Then I decide how far back to go - Godrics Hollow? When Lily and Sirius first meet eyes and later on Harry Black is magically turned into Harry Potter? First Year? The train, platform - Does he even /go/ to Hogwarts?

I'm waffling - which is funnily enough a good idea of just what my plotting looks like - forty-off pages of scenes I've decided on, OCs I'm introducing, my own theory of magic and how to teach it.

Hope this gave inspo to someone out there - it'll be months before my first book in my series is even close to being finished (And that covers 6 months of the school year and the rest is rehab).

/Sheesh./
