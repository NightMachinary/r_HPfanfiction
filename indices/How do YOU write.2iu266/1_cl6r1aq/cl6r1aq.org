Extensive planning.

First: Come up with the story concept. E.g. "Harry Potter x Buffy fusion fic".

Second: Come up with the core elements of the fic:

- POV: Harry Potter, third person.
- Buffy universe dominant, but HP characters exist there
- Tom Riddle was a warlock who tried to take over the Watcher's Council, killing Harry's parents
- The Watcher's Council has a school (codename Hogwarts) for the kids of Watchers, and Harry went there. Magic isn't part of the curriculum, but many students dabble in it
- Fic set in 1999, when Buffy is at college (season 4) and Harry is in his second year at Cambridge university
- Harry is a warlock, tutored personally by Headmaster Albus Dumbledore
- A piece of Tom Riddle survived in Harry's scar and talks to him
- Fic to focus on Harry coming to Sunnydale to assist with a problem
- Big bad is a Grindelwald resurrected by a necromancer

Third: Come up with an ending:

- Grindelwald tries to use a ritual to ascend to godhood and is stopped by Harry and Buffy. Harry has to open himself up to his scar and its damaging influence to win, using Tom Riddle's extensive magical knowledge against Grindelwald.

Fourth: Break the plot into arcs, dividing up how to reach the ending from the opening:

- Arc 1: England. Introduction to Harry and the world, set in England. Introduce the idea of necromancers searching for Grindelwald's body. Ends with Harry (with a team of Watchers) being sent to Sunnydale, where Grindelwald's body was sent to be under the protection of the Slayer... the Slayer who no longer works for the Council.

- Arc 2: Sunnydale. Arrival in Sunnydale (on day of earthquake) and attempt to find Grindelwald's body. Ends with Grindelwald's resurrection.

- Arc 3: The Hunt. Buffy and co trying to stop Grindelwald's plan to ascend. Race to find the resurrection stone. Faith's escape. Ends with Grindelwald getting the stone.

- Arc 4: Climax. The last ditch fight to stop the ritual.

Fourth: Break down each arc into separate chapters. E.g. for Arc 1:

- Ch1: Introduction to Harry via a Norse ritual he's leading at Cambridge university. Establish the magic system, and the Watcher's Council. Sirius (Watcher) arrives and tells Harry he's needed in London.

- Interlude 1: Interludes look at Harry's past. Dumbledore takes Harry on as an apprentice following Harry successfully casting his first spell, which attracted Dumbledore's attention for both its power and danger. (Tom Riddle's voice had been guiding Harry, but this is not mentioned).

- Ch2: Harry and Sirius look around the burgled Potter home in London. They conclude the thief was looking for something in particular. Invisibility Cloak is gone. A hair left behind - enough to track them.

- Interlude 2: Harry gets into a row with a fellow student, itches to use magic to strike.

- Ch3: Tracking spell... leads to a Watcher's Council building. Loads of protection, but someone has attacked recently. Bodies everywhere. The thief is still there! Brief fight, red haired woman, but they get away - Harry shielding from bullets mostly.

- Interlude 3: Harry does something bad with magic. Hint at possession: glazed look, confusion at his surroundings when “waking” etc.

- Ch4: At the Watcher's Council HQ, briefing on Grindelwald. They want Harry to go to Sunnydale with Sirius' team to brief the Slayer and protect Grindelwald's body. He has the day to decide. He visits Hermione in Oxford, who tells him to go. Tom Riddle's voice surfaces.

- Interlude 4: Harry going to Dumbledore about Riddle's voice.

So as you can see, I kind of expand outwards, building from a concept and slowly fleshing the details out in rounds.
