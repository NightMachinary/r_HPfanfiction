Once an idea pops into my head, I make a document, which will then hold everything. First I write the basic summary, which is subject to change, and then whatever scenes come to my mind first, with snippets of dialogue and so on. Once I'm ready to begin writing the story, it just gets written at the bottom of the document, with all the scattered ideas at the top so I can easily look at them.

I haven't finished many stories, though, so this way is probably not the best. It's certainly not very organized. I'd like to try some of the ideas on this thread!
