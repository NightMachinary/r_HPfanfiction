It's been awhile since I've written fanfiction, but this is my approach to fiction and fanfiction writing:

- I sketch out my stories in a rough outline form first, writing down a few sentences to a few paragraphs to describe the highlights of each scene.
- Once I have the skeleton in place, I go back and write the most interesting scenes first, the vivid ones that drew me to the story in the first place. This is possible since I have placeholders for the other scenes.
- After that, I go back and fill in the rest of the scenes, always with the sense of what I need to accomplish in each (plot points, character development, foreshadowing, establish mood, etc.). Also, even for these less enchanting scenes, I try to find a way to make every scene interesting in some way. Otherwise, the scene doesn't belong.
- If the most interesting scenes /don't/ come out as well as I'd envisioned (which sometimes happens--you don't really know until you've put down the words), I drop the story before I've invested a huge amount of time on a subpar thing. If they do come out well, this gives me impetus to finish the rest of the story quickly to get it out there to be read.
- With one sub-par exception (my story /A Mother-In-Law's Love/), I've always written my stories to completion before posting. This ensures a sufficient level of consistency and polish in the final text. I tend to use beta readers and in the writing process will pick the brains of better writers--folks like the Alpha Fight Club crew and DLP (the Work by Authors threads), who often catch typos and consistency errors.
