Usually my writing preparation is a mixture of rigid formality and absolute chaos. In concern to characters I will usually spend weeks writing up important AND non-important characters relevant to my story whether they be OCs or canon. I like to know everything about my characters that is feasible, so I usually end up with a gargantuan file filled with profiles of characters big and small, vital and largely insignificant.

The story itself is far less organized, with bits and pieces of plot devices set while others are intentionally left vague so as to allow me to alter them how I see fit when I get around to writing that section (as I am want to do).

I find myself writing small scenes and the rare chapter whenever inspiration strikes. For the several projects I am currently sitting on I have a folder filled to the brim for each which holds all the small pieces of writing I have done for them whether they be good or bad.

I guess when it comes to Harry Potter I do like to have as much relevance to canon events as possible. I loath re-writing sections of the book unless its absolutely necessary, so I like to write more about things that could have/should have/did happen but weren't in the actual books.

Overall the writing process is wild but honestly I love it. Its fun and considering the way my imagination works I'm always keen to see how my ideas develop.
