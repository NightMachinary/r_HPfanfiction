I can be all over the place, but I always start structured. I'll use a fic (someone recommended it) I'm writing as an example.

Someone requested that I write a Draco! Veela/Hermione romance. So the firdt thing I do was decide what I want the Veela to be. How did he become a Veela? Is it plausible? What powers does it give him? How would people react? I did research, combining fantasy Veela with JKR's Veela.

Once done, I do character outlines. What year? How old? What are they doing in their lives? Mine is post-Hogwarts; so I have Hermione and Draco working at the Ministry. Luna is an Unspeakable, Ron plays Quidditch, etc. Who is married to who? They requested Ginny be with Blaise, so I tackle them and then who Harry make might be with post-Ginny.

And then I set up scenes. How do I want their relationships to be? That is established in the Prologue. What time of year is it? What's happening? What's the whole story? I then write down "Scenes", meaning point-form list of scenes I want to include. These are, generally, in no order. But I try to organize them.

Often, all of this is either typed in an "Outline" and printed or written in a notebook, so I can easily reference it.

I do often get inspired at work or school, so I write down those ideas and keep them with me until I can use them.

I'm kind of an organized mess. I start off right, then go all over the place when inspired. But, I always make sure that the story is structured and well organized; including physical time (I read a fic one that jumped from Fall to June to September and it made no sense).

It's funny, I kind of write fics the same way I write essays...haha.

Also, I always need popcorn with me and good music. Can't do it without either.
