It depends on my inspiration for a story (I'm usually a one shot writer of hp). I usually hand write key paragraphs or sentences that I want to emphasize in the story. Then I grab the computer and free write. I'll go back and tweak if something pops into my head along the way. Once it's done, I proof read, let it sit for a few days to a week, and proof read it again. Then up it goes to the internet ðŸ˜Š
