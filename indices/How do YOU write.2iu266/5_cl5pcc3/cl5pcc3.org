I come up with the main events I want to happen. I write all my ideas in a notebook and pay special attention to each individual character. I have separate notebooks for each main character listing personality traits, likes, dislikes, habits, back stories, etc. I then create a time line for the events I want to happen in the book, followed by an outline for each chapter. The I start writing. :) It sounds harder than it is. I feel like most of it just plays out in my head, so the only hard part is just putting the words together to portray what I want. Then I have my beta look over each chapter before I upload it. I really don't have a problem with writers block, like I said it all kind of just plays in my head like a movie, but the outline helps ensure I stay on track and don't forget significant events. Or small ones that are meaningful later.
