The Santi? By what metric? He's got one unfinished vampire!Harry fic that went nowhere, a dark lord!Harry fic that's quite bad, and a twin fic that is a thinly veiled powerwank/training montage where the author wrote himself into a corner at the beginning of year 4 and couldn't get himself out of when he tried to be too fancy. The last part is the amazing part, since the dude had like 6 betas helping him. But it's got an interesting OC, right?
