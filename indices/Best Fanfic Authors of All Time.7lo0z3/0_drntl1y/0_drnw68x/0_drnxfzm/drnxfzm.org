I'll be honest I only included him for the obvious fic. Not claiming it's perfect by any means, but it's one of the few stories that captivated me from beginning to abandoned. The world building surrounding Durmstrang was particularly enjoyable. I admit it was one of the first fics I read, so my opinion on the story may be a tad immature. I should probably give it another read at some point.

You're right though - according to the OP he shouldn't be listed as he only had one noteworthy story.
