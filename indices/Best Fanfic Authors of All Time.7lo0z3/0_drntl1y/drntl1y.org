Steelbadger, Shezza, nonjon, Brennus, TheEndless7, DobbyElfLord, Jeconais and The Santi. They have all written more than a few stories that I found greatly enjoyable. I'd also hesitantly include Newcomb and Marquis Black, despite them not having many great stories to their name. What You Leave Behind and Emperor are some of my favorite fanfictions.
