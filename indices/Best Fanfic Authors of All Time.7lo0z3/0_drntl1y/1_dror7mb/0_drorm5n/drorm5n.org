Well I guess that's a little subjective. Been around since 2009 in any case. I don't see where you get your doesn't-do-enough Harry from DobbyElfLord. He did lots of ruthless stuff in Altered Destinies' war. I read Santi's fic a year or two after I got into fanfictions, still young and hadn't really looked at a whole lot of fics yet. Haven't read it since, so I guess the magic sortof stuck with me.
