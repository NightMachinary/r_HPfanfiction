Alpha Fight Club, an invite-only group of FF authors who read one anothers' work and help each other out: jbern, Japanese Jew, nonjon, BajaB, IP86, Master Slytherin, CheddarTrek, respitechristopher, SomeGuyFawkes, Clell65619, myself, etc.--some high quality writers and betas of fanfiction/original fiction (and me, the quality outlier).
