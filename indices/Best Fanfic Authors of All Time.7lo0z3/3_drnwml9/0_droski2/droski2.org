My own list would include several fellow AFC writers and some fanficauthors.net writers (though the bobmins blocked my membership back in the day) and will no doubt offend several friends:

Jbern and nonjon, for sure; also, BajaB for the short fic brilliance. Jeconais and S'TarKan. joe6991. Deadwoodpecker was awesome when she still wrote. Taure and DobbyElfLord are both great in their own way. To round out my list of ten, Inverarity.

Honorable mention to Arsinoe de Blassenville, enembee, the late Larry Huss, Voice of the Nephillim, and TheEndless7. I'm missing a billion, no doubt, but this is my top-of-mind.
