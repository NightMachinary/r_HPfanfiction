I read one a while back where Harry goes to Azkaban (possibly blamed for the Chamber of Secrets), breaks out with Sirius via animagus transformation (I think he's some kind of bird) and they meet up with Remus. Later, Remus goes to teach while Harry and Sirius come with as his pets. I'll go look for it.
