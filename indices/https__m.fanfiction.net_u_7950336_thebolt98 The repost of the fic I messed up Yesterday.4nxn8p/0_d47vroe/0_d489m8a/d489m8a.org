The issues with this fic can't really be fixed with a beta; they'd end up having to do more work than the author to make the fic readable.

What OP really needs to do, is to head out and buy a style manual, and start practising grammar exercises until he/she has it down completely. Furthermore, OP needs to read some of the recommended list, and then evaluate whether their fic is worth writing or not. Having read the chapter, even excusing the poor grammar, it's well... excuse me for being blunt, but it's just not very good.

So far, this fic seems like a clich√© retelling of GOF where the only difference is that Harry is now a ladies' man. It's one thing to have bad grammar but a fresh plot; it's another thing entirely to have both bad grammar and a story that has been trod and retrod ten thousand times over.
