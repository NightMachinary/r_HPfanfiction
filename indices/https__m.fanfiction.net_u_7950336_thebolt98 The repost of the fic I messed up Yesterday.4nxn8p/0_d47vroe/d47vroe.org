Has so many grammar mistakes I can't be bothered to begin. It also sounds cheesy and cliched. I'm sorry to be so blunt, but this is now your third? fourth? post on this story in about two days. Keep it to one thread, and wait until you have it to a readable standard with decent editing. Like I said, this community is willing to help, but it's not something that should be expected of us, and we need to feel you're putting the effort in. Find. A. Beta.
