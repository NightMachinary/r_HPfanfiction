If that's all it took you to get mad, you are not prepared for constructive feedback.

Look, I understand grammar is hard. Especially if you have a learning difficulty (I'm assuming something like dyslexia?) or you're just starting out. It's also very boring. I actually teach English as a foreign language, and even I make grammar mistakes often in my fics. That's why I always get someone else to read it first. But I cannot emphasise to you how important it is. If you genuinely want to improve your writing, you need to spend a lot of time understanding the fundamentals of the English language. You need to do LOTS of reading (and it can't just be any old crap from ff.net, it needs to be proper books or at least highly recommended fics from this sub or DLP) and you need to practice certain grammar rules over and over again until they become natural. Perhaps try looking up some TEFL lessons on YouTube. Start with understanding sentence structure and syntax - what is a verb? A noun? How do we use adverbs and adjectives? Move on to practising the differences between there/their/they're, or too/to, or your/you're. Move on to working out how to use commas. For example, your summary starts with a list of traits that are missing commas. Between all of this, read read read read.

If you manage to find a beta, take the time to notice where the corrections are, and try to work out why they are there. Try to understand where you are going on, and how you can remember to correct it in the future.

And, I'm really sorry... But one evening is a lack of effort. It takes me at least a week to get a 5000 word chapter ready to publish, and that is extraordinarily lazy by many people's standards.
