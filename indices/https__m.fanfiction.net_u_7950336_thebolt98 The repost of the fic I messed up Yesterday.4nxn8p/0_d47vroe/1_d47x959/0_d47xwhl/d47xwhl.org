The amount of time means nothing when we can't actually see any improvement in your grammar and writing technique. This is not something you can fix by running a spell check and reading it through over and over again - you have a fundamental lack of understanding about grammar and syntax. This is stuff that should have been learnt at primary school. I understand that you have difficulties, and that must be very frustrating, but the fact that only now have you asked where the best place to find a beta is speaks volumes. The very first post you made on this forum should have been looking for a beta. You know that is your weakness. Telling everyone "it will get better" means nothing because it's such a crucial part of people being able to understand your writing.

Furthermore, you've mentioned that you wrote this in a day. It really shows. Really. You need to be more humble about this. There's always room for people to improve and generally speaking this community is supportive. But you are currently at a very low standard of writing.

As for where to find a beta; it's not easy, especially not at the level of help you would need. But the forums at ff.net are a good place to start.

If you don't want to do all of this and just want to write for fun, that's absolutely fine. You will still find readers on ff.net. But communities like this one and DLP prefer stories of a publishing quality, and the writers here go through many drafts, revisions and corrections before we ask for feedback.
