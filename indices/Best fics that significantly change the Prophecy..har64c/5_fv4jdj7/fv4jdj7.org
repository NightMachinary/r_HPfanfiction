Linkffn(Yule Ball Panic) This trilogy is a really good series, one of the best stories I've read. The prophecy is changed significantly and there is another prophecy as well if I remember correctly. The story is mainly focused on H/Hr shipping but since it's a fem!Harry story, it's femmslash. The story starts in 4th year and is about 700k words total.
