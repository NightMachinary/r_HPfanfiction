While you're at it, allow me to share with you a tidbit from Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived, a non-magical AU where at one point Hermione punishes the twins for their behaviour - by infecting their computer with a virus that sets their desktop background to a photoshopped picture of naked Dolores Umbridge.

  “AAAAAAAGGGHHHHH! MY EYES!”

  George snickered, “I think you win this round, Granger.”

  “I CAN'T UNSEE IT! HELP MEEEE! SOMEBODY SHOOT ME!”

  George added, “I'm going to have to bill you for the ensuing lobotomy.”

  Hermione ruthlessly asked, “Can he afford to lose any brain matter?”

  “Nope, but it'll have to be done. Or maybe it's cheaper to remove his larynx. I'll ask at the hospital. Maybe I should've asked those berks to shoot off both my ears.”

  “AAAAAAAAGGGGHHHH!”

  Hermione firmly said, “After he apologises to Ron, and Ron tells me it was a real apology instead you boys' usual nonsense, I'll see what I can do.”

  “AAAAAAAGGGHHH! OEDIPUS KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING! NOW THEY TELL ME! AAAAAGGGHHH”
