There you have it; soft magic. The laws were always kind of fuzzy and in no moment were we given explanations for the why's or how's. All we know for sure about Horcruxes is that it needs a kill, the exact limit of how involved you must be in the act or what counts or not are ambiguous though. For example, the murder of Myrtle apparently counts, even if it was for all intents an accident and the one to actually do the deed was the Basilisks. While we can rule out it being dependent of subjective morality based in Voldemort's success compounded with his casual disregard for human life petty much all the rest is in the air. Theoretically if the person only needs to feel responsible for the death of someone they consider innocent then Harry should be able to use Cedric's or Sirius deaths to meme an Horcrux.
