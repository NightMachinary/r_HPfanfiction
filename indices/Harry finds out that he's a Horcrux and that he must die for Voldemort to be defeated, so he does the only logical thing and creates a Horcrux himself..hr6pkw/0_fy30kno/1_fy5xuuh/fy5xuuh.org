Not if he kills someone who really deserved it, SuperAbusive!Dursleys for example, or Bellatrix, Umbridge, even Snape if it's before the revelation. Hell, if there isn't a time limit for the time between murder and creating the Horcrux he could use Quirels death, Dumbledore saying that it was Quirel's fault guaranteed that Harry didn't have remorse for this.

Alternatively he could use a mercy-kill to create the Horcrux. Just go into an hospital, find the most in pain, with no chance of recuperating, all loved ones dead unfortunate fool, make the offer and kill him. Wouldn't even need to be AK or magic at all, just unplugging a socket would be enough in some cases.
