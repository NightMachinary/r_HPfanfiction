When I say killing in cold blood, I mean willfully killing someone that you know is an innocent. Harry believed that Sirius was a traitor and the reason why his parents were dead. Harry knows that Voldemort is an unrepentant monster. If Harry were to kill them (before learning Sirius was innocent), it wouldn't damage his soul to the point that it would fracture, but if he were to say, corner a first year and kill them, that would do it.
