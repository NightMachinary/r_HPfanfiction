Murdering someone for the purpose of extending your own life isn't exactly as righteous as mercy killing someone on their own request.

Not even Harry's overall goal of killing Voldemort is as righteous as Snapes overall goal since he desires to be the one who kills Voldemort out of a desire for revenge while Snape does what he did for the sake of the woman he loved(as twisted of a love it was).
