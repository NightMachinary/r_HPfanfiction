Nothing about needing to murder someone says they need to be innocent. If I locate someone I know without a doubt to be serial child molester and serial killer, but still kill them just because I wanted to, thats still cold blooded murder.

In this case nothing would stop Harry from finding someone like Greyback and murdering them to make his Horcrux.
