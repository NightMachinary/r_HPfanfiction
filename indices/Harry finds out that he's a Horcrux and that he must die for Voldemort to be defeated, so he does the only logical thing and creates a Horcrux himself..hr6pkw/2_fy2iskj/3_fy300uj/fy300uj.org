Depends on the actual requirements for making a Horcrux.

If there are no additional horrific requirements other than the murder, (Lots of fics imply or explicitly state more disturbing requirements) then it comes down to the definition of murder.

From a legal perspective, murder is the unlawful, premeditated, killing of another human being. In which case killing a death eater outside of the heat of battle would count. Harry generally is against murder, even when it causes issues (see letting fucking Dolohov without at least turning him into a vegetable at the beginning of book seven) That being said, I don't think it would take much pushing to get Harry to that point, especially if they captured Bellatrix for example.
