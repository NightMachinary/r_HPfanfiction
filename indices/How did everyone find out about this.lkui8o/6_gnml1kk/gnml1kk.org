Ron and Hermione are presumably not his only friends, they're just his best friends and the only ones that are part of his adventures at that point. I think it's safe to assume that he speaks to many other students regularly and there's no reason to think he hides that he lives with muggles or that he dislikes them. Even if he doesn't talk to anyone besides Hermione and the Weasley's, it's reasonable to think that they talk to other people and that Harry would come up.
