I prefer to think he's joking and actually there are only made-up stories, because literally the only two people alive knowing this are Dumbledore and Harry and Harry just woke up. Then again, maybe Dumbledore is terrible gossip =D

Anyway, yours at least has the potential way of Ron having told someone, or Harry having told someone off-screen. I don't see why he would, but that's more accurately to say, I don't see why /I/ would do that, and maybe, for Canon!Harry, the question is why he /wouldn't/.

Canon!Hogwarts isn't Fanon!Slytherin, where you have keep your Muggle ties under wraps or you'll end up socially dead.
