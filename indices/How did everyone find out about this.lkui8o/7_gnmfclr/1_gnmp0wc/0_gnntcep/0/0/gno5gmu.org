My definition of "complete secret" doesn't involve the entire staff. Three may keep a secret if two of them are dead etc., but yes, that aside, that is probably how it worked, if we assume people /do/ know.

It's semantics at this point, but for me, either the "complete secret" is tongue-in-cheek, or "the whole school knows" (as in, anyone knows anything that is true) is.
