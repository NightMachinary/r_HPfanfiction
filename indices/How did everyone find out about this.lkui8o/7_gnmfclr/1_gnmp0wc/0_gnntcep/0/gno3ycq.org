I think "complete secret" doesn't necessarily mean he told no one. Secrets can be held by groups as well as individuals. Rather it implies he hasn't told anyone outside the group of people who should be told.

I expect he told the staff (who were all involved in protecting the stone) and then that conversation led to the spread.
