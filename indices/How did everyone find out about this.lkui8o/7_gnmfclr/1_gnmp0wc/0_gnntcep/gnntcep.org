There is that, but they'd have to know from somewhere, too -- there were no ghosts, portraits or other semi-alive things in the chamber with the mirror. It must come down to Dumbledore talking about it, in the end. And then either someone or something overheard, or whoever Dumbledore told spread it.

If Dumbledore told no one, I don't see how anyone could know. Which I'd assume is the case, given he declares it a "complete secret".

Of course, Dumbledore needn't have been serious. But on the face of it, his statement doesn't make sense. Then again, maybe that was the point, this /is/ in the context of the Fred and George sending toilet seats.
