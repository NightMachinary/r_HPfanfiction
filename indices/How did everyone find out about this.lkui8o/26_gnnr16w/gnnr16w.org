Can't disagree with Harry there; I'd probably murder them in their sleep. I'd do it without magic though, so the muggles would be the one's taking exception.

The muggle government might find a bit more than just my actions to complain about, though.

I'd be sure to punish myself by locking myself back into my cupboard after the fact, though. Freaks need to sleep in their rooms. A few days without food will not have been the worst I've had, by that point.
