Ultra-isolation of The Golden Trio is just a fanon thing (as well as the term The Golden Trio itself). And let me remind you that there are those HUGE gaps in the story telling (go and look for sentences like “And then whole spring nothing interesting happened.”). We don't know what happened during those time slots, but quite certainly, for example, Harry interacted quite a lot with his comrades on the Quidditch team, he was in all his classes with his classmates, etc.
