I would think even if Ron and Hermione didn't tell anyone, by that point in Chamber of Secrets, plenty more people can know or infer.

- Fred and George saved him with a flying car and he had bars on his windows. Not saying they'd blab out Harry's awful home life but I imagine they'd told the story of getting Harry from his muggle house with the flying car a few times.

- Percy knows. And with all his love notes to Penelope that summer, I'm sure he dropped a mention of Harry Potter arriving on their doorsteps.

- He stays at Hogwarts for Christmas. He wasn't rare in that regard since the Weasleys stay with him but still could be another point of enforcing that rumor.
