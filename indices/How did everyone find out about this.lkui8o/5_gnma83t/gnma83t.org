Maybe the Golden Trio are not the only people who have tea with Hagrid. I'm guessing most of the school gossip starts with the giant man who can't keep secrets...

How else do you think everyone in the Wizarding world knows Harry has a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt? After bringing Harry to Dumbles, Hagrid probably went to join all the festivities for the fall of the Dark Lord and after his 4th barrel of ale, started talking about taking Harry from the destroyed cottage.

I could see Lavender Brown and others having tea with Hagrid and chatting him up for the latest gossip about the teachers and things happening in Hogsmede... Or just stuff about Harry and Ron.
