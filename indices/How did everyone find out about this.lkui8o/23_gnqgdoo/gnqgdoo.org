The main question is: *Why won't anybody do anything about it as his friend?*

Also don't give me any Dumbledore related comments because I already know that Ron tried to fly a freaking car to help out Harry without permission, What I want is just as a classmate, personally, even if my enemy is hurt, I would help cause I want my enemy to be equal to me if I want a challenging force[not trying to be a saint or anything.], and the same with friends and classmates and within a bajillion kids at Hogwarts, someone would probably have the same mindset, so why won't they help their world-wide known savior?
