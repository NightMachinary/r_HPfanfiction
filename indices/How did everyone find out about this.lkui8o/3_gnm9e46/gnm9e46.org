Honestly, when a kid's that famous, all sorts of rumors are going to fly. There will be versions like Snape's where Harry is a spoiled and doted upon child, others where his family hates him, etc. At that point in the story, the school is reeling with the idea of Harry being Evil Slytherin Heir, so the negative rumors gain more ears and credibility.

That's my take, anyway. Harry IS a slightly snarky, cheeky kid early in the books and I wouldn't be surprised if he made sarcastic comments about how lovely the Dursleys' Christmas presents to him were within earshot of other people.
