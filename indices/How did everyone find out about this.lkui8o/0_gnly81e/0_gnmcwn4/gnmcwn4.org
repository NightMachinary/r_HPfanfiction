The incident you mentioned took place after the quote OP mentioned, but you're absolutely right, Harry almost certainly makes comments in public. At a bare minimum, most of Gryffindor probably knows since he doesn't have any stuff in his room like Ron's Quidditch fan stuff and Dean's football poster. I'd imagine they'd have had off-screen conversations where they talk about where in the Muggle world they're from, too.
