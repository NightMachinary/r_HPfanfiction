If hogwarts has about 1000 students, that means each year in each house has 35-36 students. Idk about you but that's how many I had in my class growing up. Yea it's a small school in total, but 35 is a pretty big class on its own. Could you imagine sorting ceremonies with much more than 140-150 kids? It'd be way too long lol
