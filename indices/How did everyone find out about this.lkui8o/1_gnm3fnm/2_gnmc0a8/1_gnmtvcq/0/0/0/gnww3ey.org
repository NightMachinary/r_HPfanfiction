I've always wonder anyway what their class table is. They are always taught with another house so they would have 14 classes at a time. But there are only 13 subjects. So two houses would always have a free hour. 2 actually if we go with, how I know it, 15 classes in a week. Not to forget that usually they only pick two of the selected subjects so the majority has only 10 subjects a week. And Astronomy is taught in the evening/night so that makes it 7 subjects at day time for the 1./2. years and 9 for the rest. Also since a week has 7 days it's the entire year in one class

5 subjects are only taught from 3rd year so 1st and 2nd years only have 7 day-time subjects a week and, if we go with how I know it, having 3 classes a day they would have had every class in 2 and 1/3 days. Of course, in our world, we have some classes 2 times a week but what about the later years? They can't all have the selected subjects at the same time after all. And it would be idiotic if only the first 2 years had all subjects 2times a week but not the others.

The most obvious solution is afternoon classes so that is the only way I think it could work not having to use a time turner.
