This just brings us back to fact that JK Rowling is bad at math. The hoops that are necessary to jump through to calculate something like a class schedule are very good proof of that. Or, we have to assume that the universe which leaked its fictons into JK's head runs completely disconnected from the time-space continuum as we know it, beyond the existence of magic.
