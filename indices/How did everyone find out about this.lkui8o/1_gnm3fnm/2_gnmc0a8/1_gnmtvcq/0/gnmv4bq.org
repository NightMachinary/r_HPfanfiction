I've never actually gotten anywhere in terms of writing fanfic and a big part of that is that I'm so neurotic that during one of my many failed attempts I decided to take on the maddening task of creating class schedules for all of Hogwarts before I actually even started writing.

If I remember correctly I started out with the high estimation and then pared it down to as low an estimate as I could get and it was still nearly impossible for all the classes to get taught because Hogwarts has criminally low staffing levels. Unless the staff are secretly using time turners to get more teaching time in, Hogwarts had been operating at /beyond/ a skeleton crew for basically all of canon that we see. And that's not even touching on their other duties.

Harry's year canonically has 40 students though I think --- 10 for each house. How convenient that they just happened to be personality sorted into even groups!
