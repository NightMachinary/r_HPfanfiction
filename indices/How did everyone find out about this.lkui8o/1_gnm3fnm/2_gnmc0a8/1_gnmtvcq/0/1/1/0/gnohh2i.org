Thanks for looking those up! That's really interesting.

I think after Tolkien and George R. R. Martin the trend for fantasy has been to create these complete worlds, when that didn't used to be the standard. I think there's just a higher standard for consistency and realism these days than then, and maybe in recent interviews JK feels like she needs to put up that front. I don't listen to them anymore either. I still think the writing style, details, and mysteries in HP are very engaging
