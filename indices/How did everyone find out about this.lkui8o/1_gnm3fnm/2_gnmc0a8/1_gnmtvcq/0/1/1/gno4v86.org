I looked into it and I don't think it's stated in the books (I guess I imagined that, whoops) but here was some info I found on it, we can extrapolate most of it based on the named characters that we know but at the moment I'm too tired to go through and check.

I stopped paying attention to the things JK Rowling said even way before her current role as TERF twitter goblin precisely because of things like this, you can use the things that she's said as a general guideline and the Harry Potter world is well poised to explore a lot of really interesting themes but if you take a serious and cohesive look at her world building (especially the math/logistics parts) for more than about ten seconds it starts falling apart at the seams.

She's like my DM who last session (in D&D) was like “oh you know how you got a bunch of money from that boss you just beat and now you obviously want to buy a ton of healing potions? Well I'm now realizing that full heal potions are kind of OP and so for balance purposes healing potions are now 15x as expensive”

Like I will never get over how COMPLETELY NONSENSICAL THE WIZARDING MONETARY SYSTEM IS. AAAAAH. Like, even disregarding the purposefully obtuse coin designations the value of galleons seems to wildly swing. How much is a galleon worth? Who knows! I've seen estimates ranging from $2 to $50, either of which is terrible and stupid.
