And this is something that bothers me about the books. It's so odd that barely any of his classmates get to know him until the DA.

However, to argue against myself, Harry was hated/ostracized by a significant portion of the school for large chunks of 2nd and 4th years. This could certainly impede making friends. (Hogwarts staff and, more generally, adults in Harry's life failed him on so many levels. You can see how Dumbledore bashing is plausible)
