  I honestly don't see why Harry actually trusts people like Mcgonagall, Remus and Dumbledore.

I kinda have the headcanon that Remus wasn't allowed by Dumbledore to see Harry when he was a child and then at Hogwarts, Dumbledore asked (ordered) him not reach out for Harry, because we all know that he wanted Harry to feel alone and unprotected so he would sacrifice when the time came.

Also, consider the fact that Remus has a lot of issues with self-esteem and he considers himself a monster. Also the wizarding world is extremely prejudiced against "half-breeds" and Remus wouldn't be able to raise a small child because for starters, he barely managed to get a job. Also, when he WAS there in POA he tried to help Harry the most (everyone knew abt his problem with dementors) and when he found out he and the others were with Sirius, he went to aid them.

Now, Mcgonagall is just a stern professor, distant. To her credit, in GOB she was the most vocal about not letting him compete in the tournament AND she was adamant (albeit not going against Dumbledore in the end) not to let Harry with the Dursleys.

Dumbledore is just a disappointment. Honestly, I adored him as a kid, but now at 21 I just can't understand how ppl still think he's the greatest man. He KNEW Harry was being abused by the Dursleys, let him there, didn't explore ANY other options, let Sirius rot in Azkaban despite being Chief Supreme of the Wizengamot. I mean, even if Sirius WAS guilty, he got SNAPE a trial, but didn't do it for a man he KNEW, who fought by his side. And the amount of times he let Harry face unbelievable danger?? And leading him to believe bhe SHOULD die? Thats a big no no
