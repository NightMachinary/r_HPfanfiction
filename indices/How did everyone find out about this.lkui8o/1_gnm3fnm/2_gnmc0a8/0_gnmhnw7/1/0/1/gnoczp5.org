The issue is that the writer is basically saying "Look how useless all the adults in the childrens book have to be to make the plot work" "So are you going to improve the plot or make them competent?" "Oh no I'm just going to call them all evil and have an 11 year old manage to get them all fired and disgraced, then he'll solve the rest of the plot in two chapters with the aid of goblins, who I've decided are actually awesome healer-curse breaker-warriors rather than greedy bankers, then when I'm out of ideas I'll have every named female character joing a harem and abandon the story"
