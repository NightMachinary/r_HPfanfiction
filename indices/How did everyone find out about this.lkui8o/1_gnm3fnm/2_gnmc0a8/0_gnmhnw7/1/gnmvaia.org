A lot of Dumbledore bashing and other adult bashing in fanfic isn't actually bashing, It is just pointing out the flaws and how useless most of the adults are for Harry in canon, I honestly don't see why Harry actually trusts people like Mcgonagall, Remus and Dumbledore.

The person who does most for Harry is Sirius Black and he was in azkaban for years and on then on the run. The rest of the Wizarding world abandoned Harry to 10 years of abuse and then Dumbledore sends him back to even more abuse every year. Dumbledore is just a shitty person
