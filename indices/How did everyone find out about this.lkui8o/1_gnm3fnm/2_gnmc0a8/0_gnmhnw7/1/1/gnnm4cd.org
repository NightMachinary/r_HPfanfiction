I don't remember who pointed this out. But You could replace Canon Dumbledore with a manipulative One and the plot would never change one bit.

There was a oneshot collection where harry was Dumbledore's Horcrux. And he was speaking to Dumbledore's soul fragment in the train scene .

Harry was like wait how are you here? Dumbledore's soul fragment, said whelp time for a memory charm.

Long story short ended with harry's body possessed fully by Dumbledore's soul. And my guess Albus Severus potter would become the next host.

If you ignore CC. (Which I never read or saw.) This could be cannon and never change anything at all.
