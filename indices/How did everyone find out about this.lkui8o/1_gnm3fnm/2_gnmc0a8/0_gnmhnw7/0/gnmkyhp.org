It's part of JK Rowling's larger worldbuilding/adaptation issue where she wanted to have a larger and more complex world than she wanted to write or could actually keep track of. It also tracks with the tonal issues, having a world that was fantastical and logistically off is fine in a children's book but less fine if we're expected to take it seriously.

An adjacent issue: Hogwarts just point blank doesn't have enough teachers for the amount of classes that need to be taught and all of the heads of houses are also core subject teachers and sometimes have other jobs on top of that.

Hot take that shouldn't be a hot take but I rarely see: Hogwarts is a /terrible/ school even /without/ the yearly Voldemort attacks.
