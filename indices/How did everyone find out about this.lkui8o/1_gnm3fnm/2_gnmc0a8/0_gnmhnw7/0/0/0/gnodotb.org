I find that highly doubtful, on the very base level you would have to be at least peripherally aware of what's going on, if not be able to be emotionally and physically present for a large group of preteens and teenagers --- which if you've ever done babysitting you know is draining even if literally nothing is going on. At least, that's what you would need to do the job competently. I guess the way Hogwarts gets it done is by ignoring it and hoping the need for it will go away.
