It's not like being Head of a House seems to involve any extra work most of the time, which is a good thing since they teach the four biggest subjects (other than defence, but when you can't keep a teacher for more than a year you're not about to give them any role beyond the minimum).\\
They only really seem to get involved if something goes wrong and someone competent needs to be in charge of a quarter of the school.
