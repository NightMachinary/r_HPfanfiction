I love McG. As a person. She's a badass and her sense if humour is my second or third favourite in the series.

As far as her duties as HoH though, I think it's more maybe she sucks? I don't see Flitwick, Sprout, or Snape brushing in-house problems under the rug. I like to justify it by thinking teaching a core subject, being Deputy Head, and a HoH is just too much for any one person merely because I love her as a person so much.
