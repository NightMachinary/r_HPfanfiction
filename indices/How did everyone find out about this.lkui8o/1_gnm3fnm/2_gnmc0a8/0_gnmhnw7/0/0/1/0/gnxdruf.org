Luna's treatment by her house, Harry's treatment by Hufflepuff House in books 2 and 4, and Severus' favoritism in all books show that none of the HoH are doing much to curb the worst behavior of their houses, and are somewhat blatantly brushing any problems under the rug. Fanon may exaggerate all of these instances, but they're in the canon.
