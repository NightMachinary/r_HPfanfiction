Also Hogwarts is like, ridiculously small. JK Rowling once said that it had like 1000 students but there's no way that's logistically possible and JK Rowling has the math and logistics skills of a six year old caveman trying to do calculations with tally marks. Harry's year has only 40 students that he's interacting with pretty regularly for /years/ and when you're in a small school environment like that it isn't implausible that you would get a decent familiarity with people.
