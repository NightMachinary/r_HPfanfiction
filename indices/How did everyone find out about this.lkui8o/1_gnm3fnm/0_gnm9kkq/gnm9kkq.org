It is also pretty obvious to the entirety of the UK Wizarding World that Harry grew up with muggles. The kid beats Voldemort then disappears for 10 years? Owls can't reach him except for the Hogwarts letters? No one can divine the location of the most famous child alive?

So people would talk about it at school and Harry would probably have to explain it over and over.
