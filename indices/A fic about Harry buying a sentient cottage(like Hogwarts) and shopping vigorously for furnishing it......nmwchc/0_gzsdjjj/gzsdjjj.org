Not that fic, unfortunately, but linkao3(House Proud) contains a sentient Grimmauld place which a post-war Harry is forced to fix up.

I'm not a fan of Drarry at all, but I still massively recommend it - it's not explicit at all, and it's hands down one of the most unique fics I've ever read, and I've been on the lookout for something similar ever since.
