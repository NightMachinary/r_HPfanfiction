It was said not to long ago that linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes) can fit into any request, and it really can.

Throughout the story, Harrymort uses Dobby as a slave, making him steal from the Malfoys (generally food and the like). For a closer fit to the request, in Chapter 6, HP vs Alastor Moody (Pt 1), Harrymort starts a production line of house elves to put his name in the Goblet of Fire an absurd amount of times.
