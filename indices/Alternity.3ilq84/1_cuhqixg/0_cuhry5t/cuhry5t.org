I haven't seen The Inbetweeners, but after seeing him as F-F for so long, when I saw a trailer for the second movie and recognized him, it made me want to watch it.

(I do love Saoirse Ronan as the OC Hydra, though)

Oh my god, I just did an image search for 'jay the inbetweeners' and reading the quotes and thinking of F-F, lmao.
