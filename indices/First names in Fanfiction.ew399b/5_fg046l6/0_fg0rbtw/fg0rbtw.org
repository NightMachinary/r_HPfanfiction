I'm also from the middle East...

We call almost everyone by their first name...

And if you refer to someone by their title, it would be /only/ the title. "Sir Prime minister", "Sir/ma'am minister" and much less common: "the doctor", "the teacher". Ma'am and sir are used mostly when trying to catch the attention of someone you don't know: "ma'am, you dropped something".
