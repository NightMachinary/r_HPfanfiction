I think it's (when used by good writers) used to show that Harry is still uncomfortable with having his opinion taken into account. Whether you think the Dursleys physically abused him or not, you have to agree they emotionally abused him and that has to have had some effect on his self-esteem.

Well, I think so. I have no experience with this (thankfully), so I can't say for sure.
