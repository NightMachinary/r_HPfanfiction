In a lot of these, it's got Harry in a position of social status (eg, being a Lord). Past that, moving to a first name basis shows that you're friendly with them. So the idea is less of you telling the bank to call you by your first name - but instead, one of the bank's biggest customers, someone super famous and rich and with a powerful inherited status, telling a manager or a front desk employee that they can address him informally like a friend - which conveys a /very/ different social dynamic in most societies than some random nobody doing the same. Eg, think of it like if Bill Gates did that - it'd play into a way of making him look friendly and down to earth to ask people to call him Bill, instead of Mr. Gates.

Obviously it's taken to extremes that don't really make much sense - and moving way too fast. But the idea of it isn't necessarily the worst.
