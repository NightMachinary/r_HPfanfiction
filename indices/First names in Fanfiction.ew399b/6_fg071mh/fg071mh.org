You can play a lot with names, it says a lot about how everyone sees everyone else. For example, Dumbledore calls Harry "Harry" to his mild annoyance, Snape calls Harry "Potter", other teachers go with "Mr. Potter". Personal friends go with "Harry". Harry calls Dumbledore "Dumbledore" in his internal monologue and when talking about him to friends but "Professor Dumbledore" when talking to him.
