I'd say that in the UK teachers are often the only people really called Mr/Miss. We don't use sir or miss unless to a teacher or in a super formal setting, like in court or if you're being arrested or something like that. You are almost always told by people you are talking to, to use their first name. Police officers, bank workers, university lecturers, even in a job interview. In fact I went through three years of University without learning some of my professors surnames. It creates a level of communication and openness I guess that is pretty common place in the UK. Also 90% of the time when introduced to someone they will use your first name as you will theirs unless, as I said, its super formal, or if you are asked to do otherwise. Also if you do say Miss whatever I and most people in the UK would just say "oh it's just....."

I worked in retail and in resturants and can safely say I have never called a single customer anything even close to sir/ma'am. It was excuse me and thank you. But we don't use formaility in the same way as America, I think.
