To give some context, my sister and I attended LaGuardia and Stuyvessant. And with the nieces (her children) we wanted them to go somewhere that wasn't a massive pressure cooker with limited support if kids struggle. Even at LaGuardia and Stuy and schools like that, sometimes kids struggle. Sometimes they have learning disabilities or problems at home or they simply bump into the wall of a subject that they can't learn with minimal effort and have no idea how to proceed.

We also wanted to avoid the kids going to a school that's run like a prison.

So, if you're curious (perhaps to encourage a younger cousin, sibling, or friend) and not just venting, the list for the older kid comprised mostly consortium schools (they're very academic, but exempt from Regents exams) and CTE schools (also academic, but with an emphasis on what used to be called "vocational") - so Harvest Collegiate, Essex Street Academy, Urban Assembly Maker Academy, lots of schools like that. (You'll note that the schools we picked were mostly in Lower Manhattan, which was most convenient for us, but those schools exist uptown as well. I don't know about what's around in the Bronx.)

The younger one is more arts focused and cared primarily that there was a strong art program, and more of those schools are older and more traditional.
