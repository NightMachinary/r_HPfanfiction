I just graduated last year, where were these schools when I was applying ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ woulda loved to call my history teacher MATILDA sometimes. I mean, I know of one high school in the Bronx that does that, but it's a highschool for children with disabilities so I always chalked it up to being super friendly, I guess.
