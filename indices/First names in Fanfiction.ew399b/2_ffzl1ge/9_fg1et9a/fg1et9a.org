Yeah, this. I grew up in Denmark. We have a formal rule stating that members of parliament have to address each other as "Mr/Ms Lastname" /during proceedings/, and people find that stuffy and oldfashioned because they otherwise don't. We pretty much go directly from "Firstname" to "your Royal Highness", and there aren't that many people around for whom the latter is appropriate.

I still feel weird writing dialogue with British social rules, let alone actually talking to people here.
