As a fellow Canadian, that's honestly a bit odd. As far as I'm aware, the vast majority of schools consider it “inappropriate” to address your teacher by their first name. It's a respect/discipline thing. The “cool teachers” who were less formal about it would let their students call them, Mr G. for example.
