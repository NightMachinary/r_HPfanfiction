I'm from California and I've only ever had three teachers/professors have me call them by their first name. One was a pair of co-teachers in second and third grade who I think were trying to seem cool and down to earth (spoiler: one of them enjoyed bullying me both years I was in her class - she taught 2nd and 3rd). I called them by their last names because my parents thought it was too weird.

The other was a married pair of professors in college who I knew for two years as the really involved faculty advisors to a club and in that context asked me to use their first names. By the time I was taking their classes, it was decided that it would be weird for me to start calling them Dr. Lastname and Dr. Surname.
