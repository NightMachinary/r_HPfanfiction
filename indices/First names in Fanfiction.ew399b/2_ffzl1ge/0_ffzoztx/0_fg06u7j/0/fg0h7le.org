I just graduated high school in Virginia a couple years ago. I only ever called my friends by their first name. I would call teammates by their last name if I was not close to them. I had not so flattering nicknames for some of my teachers, but I always called them with their title and last name, and most of my teachers called me by last name. Calling my teachers by a nickname would have been weird. The closest I came to using a nickname to a teacher is some teachers knew their names were hard to pronounce so they would tell us to call them Mrs M. or something like that.
