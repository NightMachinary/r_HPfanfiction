In former USSR (well, Russia, but it's common way in Belarus and Ukraine too, AFAIK) we're addressing our teachers by their name and patronymic, i.e. Nikolay Ivanovich, Elena Alexandrovna. Well, not just teachers - pretty much anyone who's not your own age or not your friend. And calling someone by his surname could be disrespectful - that's how teachers address students, officers address soldiers, government officials - pretty much anyone outside the system... So if person calls you by your surname, that usually means he considers himself your superior - well, apart from the cases when he's actually your superior.
