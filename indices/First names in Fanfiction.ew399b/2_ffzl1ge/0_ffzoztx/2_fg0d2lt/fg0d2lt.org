I'm from the Northeast and went to college in Pennsylvania, and had the opposite situation as you: Teachers and professors always introduced themselves by their first names and asked to be called by them.

Calling professors by their first names seems to be ubiquitous at liberal arts colleges, but I knew my highschool was fairly odd for doing so, even within the region.
