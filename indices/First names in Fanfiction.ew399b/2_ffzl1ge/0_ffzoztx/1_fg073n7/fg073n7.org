Northern Netherlands chiming in, first names for everyone are extremely common (honestly, sometimes aggravatingly common). The only people I've ever called Mr., Mrs., or Prof. are the CEO of the company where I did my internship, the HR lead at the same company, and a few professors at the university. Other professors are first-name basis (even names like Ben Feringa, which hasn't changed after he won his Nobel) even if I've only ever interacted with them via lectures.
