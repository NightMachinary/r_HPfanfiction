(also replying to [[/u/threadocheese][u/threadocheese]])

I live and grew up in Georgia - the US state, not the country - and I wouldn't dare call an authority figure, teacher, or doctor by anything other than "<Title> <Lastname>." I'd feel horrifically rude. I don't know how it is in other states, but /nobody/ in any of the schools I've been to would refer to a teacher by their first name until they're well out of school, and even then it would be awkward.

My point is that this varies from state to state, and from country to country.
