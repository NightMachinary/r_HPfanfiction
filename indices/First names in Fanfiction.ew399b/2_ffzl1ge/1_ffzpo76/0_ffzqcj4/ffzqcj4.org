There are quite a few fanfiction writers that I'm fairly certain have never touched the original material and rely on Fannon, but you're still right. In my school (small town USA) we address our teachers as Ms./Mr./Dr. but I know some of the alt schools nearby use first names.

The point still stands, but at least it serves as a warning to drop the fic asap.
