I can honestly say you've taught me something today, thank you. I had no idea that those regions were more... political-historical boundaries than actual geographies. I'm not sure if that's indicative of my ignorance - I'm only occasionally sure how many states there are without having to google it first - or international lack of knowledge about that sort of thing, but either way, thanks for filling me in. :)
