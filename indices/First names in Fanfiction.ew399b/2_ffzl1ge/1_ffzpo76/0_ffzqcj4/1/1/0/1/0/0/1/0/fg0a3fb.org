I'm from Minnesota, in the Midwest. I suppose it could differ. The US is a big place. :)

Edit: Region names are a bit misleading in the US because they're more cultural than geographical. There are 4, the Northeast, the South, the Midwest, and the West. The Northeast is most of the original 13 colonies, plus Maine and Vermont. I say most because some of the 13 ended up in the South. The South is made up of all the states that tried to secede during the American Civil war. The Midwest is farmland, and the Great Lakes area. It was mostly all settled before the Homestead Act of 1862, by farmers, lumberjacks, railroad towns, and people looking to use the Mississippi and the Great Lakes to ship things. The West is everything else.

So I say Minnesota is in the Midwest, even though it is along the Canadian border.
