I think it might be that way in the US, but here in the UK I can say for definite that it's unmarried vs ambiguous. We also fill out Mrs to Missus, but that's more a slang thing that an actual usage these days - you can find it used like that in older literature and news-articles and such though!

Actually, Ms, Mrs, and Miss are all short-forms of Mistress, which was the female version of 'Master' back in the day (Mr being short for Master too, incidentally). Mrs was actually pronounced Mistress, too. Mistress was mainly referring to experts/authorities in a trade or craft, like 'master of music' would be 'mistress of music' or whatever. Miss and Master were indeed both used for children at that point, but miss was solely for female children though.

Back in the 1700s and earlier, titles were entirely a class thing. The majority of people, being lower class, wouldn't have had any title at all, you'd be referred to by name only. It's a bit semantic, but mostly it just inferred some kind of authority over others (which was usually found in the older and/or higher class). The Lady of the Manor would be Mrs Whatever, as would the head of the staff, but the scullery maid (as a commoner) would be referred to by first name only.

Mrs became used (in addition to all the previous uses) to refer to older women in the late 1700s/early 1800s. We're not terribly sure why it was adopted as such, but that's the earliest time we can find that semantic connection.

Neither term definitively had anything to do with marriage at all until about 1900 or so. It was always either age, class, or expertise. Never definitively any particular one, but always one of them. Made historian's lives more difficult, as they always had to check semantics to know which one they meant.

Oh, and we did used to use Ms, too. That was just a third option for Mistress, at one point. It fell out of popularity until people picked it back up again in the 1900s as a way to talk about women that didn't revolve around what man they belonged to.
