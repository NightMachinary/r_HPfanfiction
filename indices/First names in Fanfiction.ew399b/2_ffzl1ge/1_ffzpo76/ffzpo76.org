But I assume they've read the books and after 7 books they should realize that calling authority figures by their first name or even a nickname is not normal. When writing fanfiction you already try to immitate the way of speaking of the characters. Snape shouldn't sound like a 10 year old and 10 year old students shouldn't sound like 30 year olds. Names are just another part of this.
