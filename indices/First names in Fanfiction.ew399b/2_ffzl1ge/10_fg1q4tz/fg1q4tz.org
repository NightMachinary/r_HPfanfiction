Same for me, in some sense. I am Australian and each year it changed, to be honest.

In primary school, a lot of teachers would address you by your given name as it created a small bond and allowed you to feel safer and more at home. As such, you were allowed to do the same. I feel like the older we got, the more it became uncommon to do. My nephew, who is twelve, calls his teacher by her first name and she does the same toward him.

High school, for me, was a little different as I went to an all-boys' private school. There was no way you could ever address a teacher with such disrespect. It was Mr Surname or Sir. The latter could only be used after you used the former. You would greet with Mr Surname and then use Sir for everything else.

Looking back, it was quite a headache to deal with. No wonder I always got in trouble.
