Really? I'm Canadian and we always called our teachers Mr or Mrs. Or if in French (because I did French immersion for elementary school) it was always Madame or Monsieur.

Once I graduated Highchool, I had a few teachers who invited me to call them by their first name, but not while still going to the school they taught at.

EDIT: In University I would always start out by default calling a Professor as Professor LastName but I found the occasional professor invited you to refer to them by their first name. It depended on them. Highschool and below though, by school rule it was always by title.
