I cant speak for the 90s part but oof. Britain is hugely, hugely hierarchical. Im not british but I've lived there and colleagues (I worked in a school) came up to me and gossiped about "She is really posh, her family is rich" and "Yeah he comes from a good family" and stuff like that.

The entire school was also weird when it came to teachers. In Germany, Teachers are colleagues with only a few "Fachleiter", who are not really that more important than other teachers. And then there is the headmaster/headmistress and a vice headmaster/mistress.

In England? At several schools? Its the leadership - several vice headmasters/mistresses, head of house, head of year 6,7,8,9,10 etc. Head of department, Vice Head of department (My school for example had about 1000~ pupils, with 6th form included, and was built this way), then you have the regular teachers, and the NQTs (Newly qualified teachers) below that.

What I am trying to say is: No way in hell, would regular teachers allow their students to call them by their first name. Hell, some of my supervisors didnt allow that to NQTs or Leadership would always address and demand being addressed by their proper title and last name.
