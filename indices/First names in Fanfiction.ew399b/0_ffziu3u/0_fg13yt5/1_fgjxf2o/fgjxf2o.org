I think that's the reason, i'm from argentina and i used to call most of my teachers by their first name, so for me that's not so weird. But i agree that most fics do this in a weird way, specially with people like Amelia Bones, i can get that if Harry is like 30 they call each other by their first name, but no when Harry is a teenager
