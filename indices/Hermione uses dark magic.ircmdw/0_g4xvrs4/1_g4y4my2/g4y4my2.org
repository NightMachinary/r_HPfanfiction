I always liked there being different definitions of dark magic simultaneously.

The government would have its own legal definition, that may include ALL rituals including lightside rituals. An individual on the street may say anything that does harm against a sentient (or some variant) this would include diffindo while attacking a human but not while cutting cloth. But a more pragmatical individual may use your definition.

And magic may only consider dark magic anything that effects the soul negatively thus effecting your immortal soul. ie. unforgivables and horacruxes. but not things like fyndfire or bone-breakers that just kill effectively because magic is natural and thus doesn't care.
