Dark magic should have one or more of the following traits in any setting:

1. *Cost:* There should always be a price, though said price may not be immediately obvious. In some cases, the cost is paid by unwilling victims (i.e. sacrifices).
2. *Corruption:* Use of Dark magic should, over time, corrupt the user's mind, body, and/or soul. This can be part of #1.
3. *Intent/Emotion:* It should require malign intent and/or intense emotion. This plays into #2, either just getting into the habit of such a mindset or being influenced to be more prone to suitable emotions (like the Sharingan or the Dark Side of the Force).
4. *Destruction:* In general, Dark magic tends toward the destructive rather than the protective, constructive, or restorative. Dark healing magic, if it exists, tends to be more like siphoning or transference or require a sacrifice of some sort (see #1). Dark wards are more likely to be "aggressive defenses", killing an intruder/attacker horribly rather than just trying to deny them entry. Damage caused by Dark magic can also be more difficult to repair.
5. *Addiction:* It may give the user a high, or a feeling of invincibility (looking at you Anakin...), and is addictive or habit-forming. This closely relates to #2, and between the two factors it can be /hard/ to bring someone back after years of using Dark magic.
6. *Cruelty:* Dark magic tends to cause unnecessary suffering. You can kill someone with either Dark or Light magic, but the latter is more likely to be quick and clean while the former is likely to be drawn out and gruesome. (The Killing Curse actually doesn't follow this point, interestingly, though it does play heavily into #3).

Not an exhaustive list, not every form of Dark magic will hit all the points, and there's a fair amount of overlap, but to me these factors more or less define the general form of Dark magic in fantasy fiction.
