Whatever you're describing is not something the vast majority of libertarians would agree with. It's a really obvious strawman argument and it's hard to imagine you actually believe most libertarians think this way. Obviously rape is agression. Libertarians do support taxation (maybe you are thinking of some form of anarchism??). Maybe you're a bot or fake commenter and I'm dumb for responding oO
