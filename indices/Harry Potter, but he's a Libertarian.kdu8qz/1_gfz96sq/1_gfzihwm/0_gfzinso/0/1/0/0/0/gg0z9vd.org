  What if the child consents? Is not a meme, it's a real argument that these people make, and if you truly belive in the NAP then it does stand.

And somone in some comment above explained perfectly that a child isn't capable of giving informed consent, just like a blackout drunk isn't.

Obviously it's something that needs consideration, but the argument against children being free, autonomous individuals is strong and reasonable - and only free and autonomous individuals get to make uninhibited, free choices.

And where do libertarians argue for a weak state? The argument is for a SMALL(er) state. Not weak one. You don't need China-level oversight, control and beaurocracy to enforce basic rights, you don't need a massive army taking trips to bomb kids all around the world, you don't need a massive IRS that's more scary than the police for many people...

You're purposefully misconstruing and misunderstanding the goals and arguments to build a strawman to argue against. And then add some ad-hominem because why the hell not.
