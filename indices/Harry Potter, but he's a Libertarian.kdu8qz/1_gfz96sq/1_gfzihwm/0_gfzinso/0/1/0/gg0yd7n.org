You can't just go and apply a piece of an idea where it fits your interpretation and discarding it when it doesn't.

NAP has to apply to everyone or it's pointless to bring up, and when it does a billionaire cannot use a private army for his personal violations of NAP just as I cannot take a gun and go shoot someone.

"(All) Taxation is theft" is a meme. Sure, in perfect libertarian (ancap) utopia there would be no need for taxes, but it's unattainable since you can't force everyone to obey the NAP, thus the necessary concession of minimal tax to create an impartial overseeing body of authority to enforce it. You've gotta be realistic about your ideas.

And that last part is uncalled for. Did some bad libertarian touch you when you were little? /s
