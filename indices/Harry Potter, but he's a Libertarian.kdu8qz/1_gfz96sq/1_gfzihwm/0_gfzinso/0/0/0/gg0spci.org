Science has proven that children's brains are undeveloped and can't understand the total ramifications of their choices. This is why they can't consent. Not because of laws that are different in various regions of the world. They are as scientifically unable to make logical choices as a drunk person, therefore neither are capable of giving consent, and neither are capable of refusing emergency medical treatment.
