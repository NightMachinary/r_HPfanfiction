To be completely honest, I'm not sure anymore if Ginny ever tried to take anything in canon or if it's a fanfiction thing.

It would make sense to be able to take things from the Room that were put there by people, such as the diadem, but if Filch asked for, like, detergent, why would there be any in the room of hidden things? If that room is for things that are lost, left behind or simply hidden? It had to have come from a different room in the RoR.
