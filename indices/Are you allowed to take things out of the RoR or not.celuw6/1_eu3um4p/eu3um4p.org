I don't remember the scene of Ginny failling to talke an item out, but I would suppose their is a difference between the item conjured by the room, and the ones merely brought inside. So the items created by the room (like most of the items present when Harry summon a room to learn to defend himself) are stuck there, but I see ne reason why you could not take out everything inside the Room of Lost Item, including the HBP's book and Ravenclaw's diadem.
