Yeah. I wanted something that fit with what little we were given. It had to be something that did not involve the body of the person that got murdered, because Myrtle and Tom Riddle Sr. Were both recovered unharmed. J. K. R. Said that it was so horrible it made her editor want to vomit. It also seems to have more to do with the vessel than the soul splitting or soul transfer, since the split is just murder, and the transfer happened accidentally with Harry. So, if you assume a living human is already prepared to receive a soul, the horrible part of a Horcrux is probably making the vessel into that same state.
