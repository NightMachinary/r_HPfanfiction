If fits in really well with what little we know about Horcruxes. I've always suspected some gross act after what JK said about it & refusing to share it. But how this connected with Harry being an accidental Horcrux was always peculiar.

My own theory that I developed, seems redundant now, was the idea that he has to cause further harm, maybe specifically to his murdered victim in some way, whether through their loved ones or anything attached to them in order to create a Horcrux & had to get some kind of gratification or pleasure from it all, a euphoria, & not simply just killing. It would explain how he accidentally created a Horcrux with Harry.

He killed his mother who begged for her child's life & then he intended to kill her child anyway. Murder followed by further harming of an innocent attached to his victim, sin upon sin, & gaining self-gratification & pleasure from it all, no redemption or guilt, and the result is a Horcux is created. I believed this to be the working theory to how he transferred his fractured soul into another vessel.

If murder splits the soul,then perhaps another equally heinous sin would drive it out of the body completely where it will naturally tether itself to the nearest 'body'.
