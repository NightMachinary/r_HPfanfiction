In a world where this is the way Horcruxes work, I believe Voldemort would have already split his soul, either killing Myrtle or a member of the Riddle household he had no anger towards, before discovering the theory, and then struggled to overcome the limitations to create another. Maybe he found a way to selectively alter his memory, or maybe he found a way to damage his psyche in such a way to allow him to split his soul purposefully.

I agree, power and knowledge alone makes it hard to believe that there aren't tons of people running around with world ending power.
