Okay not /entirely/ political, but....

post-Voldemort, Harry realizes none of the discrimination in the wizarding world has changed and basically decides to be a dark wizard since they're apparently the only ones who get things to happen. Harry ends up leading a lot of the kids from DA as his “followers” and half the time he's just floored that they're willing to follow him at all---which is what makes him such a good leader, according to them. Really nicely written, and I had a great time with the character study of Harry that it kind of was.
