The only Marauder's ere fic I can think of that had Remus's future employment mentioned is, I think, Stepping Back. Remus had been instrumental in saving Narcissa's life and Lord Black rewarded him with a guaranteed foot in the door in whatever profession he chose once out of school. And a lifetime supply of Wolfsbane.

In a more general sense, if there's an epilogue and everyone loves, Sirius and Remus (and sometimes Harry) starting a business is fairly common. Harry McGonagall has them start a Quidditch supply company with Back to the Future style hoverboards.
