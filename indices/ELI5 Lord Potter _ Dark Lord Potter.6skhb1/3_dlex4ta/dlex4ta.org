As many users have already explained what DLP is, I'll link a few of their resources where I have found great fics.

The top fics as rated by DLP on fanfiction.net - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/99/4/1/0/0/0/0/][Link]]

A DLP search engine created by a user there - [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/][Link to Scryer]]

The search engine is particularly useful if you filter by DLP Review Score

DLP critiques harshly, almost to the point of being caustic. You can pretty much count on the 4 and 5 star ratings being some of the best fics this fandom has to offer and even most of the 3 star fics are head and shoulders above 90% of the majority of fanfiction.
