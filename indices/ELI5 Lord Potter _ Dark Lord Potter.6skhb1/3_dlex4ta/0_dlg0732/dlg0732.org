Is DPL kind of a male domain ? For fanfic, I mean. The top fics are all widely respected and good-- but with sharper edges and less emotionality is typical. Lots of drunk Sirius and battle scenes .

My favorites are Stages of Hope and Hermione Grangers Cranmer for Delinquents on the Run. Different vibe.
