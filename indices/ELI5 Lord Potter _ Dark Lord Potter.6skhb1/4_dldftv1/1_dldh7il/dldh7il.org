That's not quite true, DLP (Dark Lord Potter) is typically fine with any trope as long as it's done well. The reason that DLP hates some tropes is that the vast, vast majority of those tropes are indicators of a bad story.

For instance, try and remember a good story, not a story that you like because it uses the tropes you like in the way you like, but a genuinely well written fic that follows the Lord Potter inheritance from the goblins trope, the Diagon Alley shopping montage trope, or the Dumbledore is evil trope. If you can think of more than 2 I'd be blown away.

These are the kind of tropes DLP (stereo-typically) dislikes; tropes that, for one reason or another, seem to either inspire poor writing or that are appealing to people that are bad authors.
