Dark Lord Potter is another community site. It is known for being a rather harsh and perhaps elitist group but maybe with reason. Many of the best authors we've had over the years have or have had a presence there and the WBA section is somewhere where work can be critiqued and checked.

Lord Potter is a trope and you're right to think it has things to do with Aristocracy. In the books the house of Black is called ancient and noble. People have taken the noble part and run with it. Now it could be an interesting premise that there is wizarding nobility, in fact Taure was recently talking about a version of this from himself. That being said, many people use it simply to make Harry 'better'. He can be richer and more influential without any effort on his or the authors behalf. It is frequently used to make Harry's life easier leading to dull stories where there is no challenge. This poor writing has lead to the whole concept being looked down upon.
