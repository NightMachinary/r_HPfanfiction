Dark Lord Potter(DLP for short) is a fairly old community site. They're known for being heavily critical for both their entrance requirements and their opinions on what make a good story. Basically, if a story has Lord Potter, Diagon Alley shopping montage, nice goblins, or evil Dumbledore, DLP will automatically label them shit - whether they are good or not. It is understandable, considering that I can count the truly /good/ Evil Dumbledore and Lord Potter stories that I have read with my fingers.

This doesn't make DLP hypocrites though, it does make them somewhat elitist, however. The writers there are among the best writers the HP FF community has to offer, and they have a keen eye for finding good stories - which they've additionally posted in the various subsections of the forum. I highly recommend taking some time to read some of the stories posted there.
