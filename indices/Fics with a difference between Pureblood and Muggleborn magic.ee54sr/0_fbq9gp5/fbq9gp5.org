I've seen two different schools of thought on it. Well, and subgroup of one.

- Purebloods are so inbred that their magical ability is being watered down and need newblood (muggleborns) to refresh the bloodline to keep it strong. Muggleborns were stronger magically and academically. Sometimes there's caveats that like muggleborns will lose their magic (squib out) after a few generations. It sounds more like horse breeding than anything. Can't remember the fic that did this.
- Family magic

1. Spells: Over the generations, the members of the family have invented, discovered spells/potions/rituals/etc and marked them as family magic. More along the lines of specialization.
2. Actual Magic: Things become a little more nebulous here. Actual magic acting like a guardian of the family. Ensuring members can't attack each other, follows the commands of the head of house. Etc.

A Marauder's Plan, linkffn(8045114) this fic goes heavily into family magics.
