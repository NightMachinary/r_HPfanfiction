I can see the view of pure-bloods being inbred and their magic becoming weaker over time but I have a different theory...

Pure-bloods have just magical blood within them which makes them stronger.

Muggleborns have a tiny magic gene passed down sometimes generations of muggles and watered down. They can still use magic fully like Hermione if it's a dominant gene

If it's a recessive gene their magic might not be as strong.

Because pure-blood genes are dominant its a hundred more times likely for pure-bloods to be powerful wizards.

And some like Neville who got the short end of the stick, a recessive gene despite being in a magical family, is a weak wizard despite being pure-blood. But that's less common.

A squib would just be a person who didn't get any magical genes from their magical family and that's about as common as muggle-borns.
