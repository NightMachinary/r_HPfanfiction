I actually wrote a whole review on it but I'll just repost it here...

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647/chapters/15327019][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]] by cambangst is probably the most underrated literary work that I have ever seen.

If I recall properly, the story is surrounding a murder mystery where Harry (as an auror) is trying to solve who murdered his wife, Ginny. It also goes into depth about how this affected his kids and his family. It is honestly one of the best fanfic murder mystery sort of story I have ever read. It has a brilliantly captivating story that simply sucks me in. The plot is unique and truly holds on its own.

The story structure is also a bit unusual consider that it jumps from the future to the past for a bit as it builds up suspense as it allows the reader to piece together the puzzle. The author really does a wonderful job in this writing style since the majority of HP fanfics are usually linear in terms of storytelling. So they already earned major bonus points from me for originality. This also includes how the author expands out of Britain for world building.

I love how each character plays off each other in a way that progresses the story that is fluid. The characters are also very distinctive. The author seriously understands each character's motives and personalities depending the situation. All the suspense and twists are also very well planned and thought out. Literally nothing is what it seems.

I absolutely, highly recommend this fic.
