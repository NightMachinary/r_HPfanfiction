Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] (W^{T} : ~400, 000; WiP; Luna pairing warning) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][HE & the Spiral Path]] (W: 462,303; on hiatus).

Both have femslash, and both have grey-blackish protagonists. The latter has a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5073471/1/Spiral-Tangents][tangential splinter story]] (W: 163,409) for sexual scenes alone.

I'm not including Firebird series in the list because it was more portraying a forced harem arrangement between characters than a femslash between fully consenting partners.
