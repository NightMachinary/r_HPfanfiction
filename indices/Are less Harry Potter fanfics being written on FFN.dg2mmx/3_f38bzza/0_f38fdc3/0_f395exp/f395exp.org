Well... AO3 really started 10 years ago, and has since taken over FF.net as the most popular fanfiction website. Basically, I think authors are splintering more these days and not cross-posting as much.

There's also less activity because HP is not strictly a fandom for an "active" source anymore. Fandoms all eventually quiet down.
