Yeah but AO3 and FF.net's purpose is to publish works, not for feedbacks like SBs creative writing forum so they're naturally going to be thin when it comes to writing advice.

I suggest you join a genuine writing forum instead or a creative writing group irl if you're actually serious about getting better at writing.
