The younger members (around the 2016 join date and above range) on SB are toxic as fuck these days. There's hardly any substance in their posts and they all try to out alpha nerd people who post actually knowledgeable replies but, for some reason, percieved as unpopular in the forum. It's a gorramn echo chamber of massive proportion these days and not really conducive to nurture a truly creative environment. I suggest writers to not post any stories there. You'll just stunt your growth as a writer.
