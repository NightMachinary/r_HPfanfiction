I think I heard him described as someone that writes for the lowest common denominator. Most people that visit this sub don't like his writing, but we're not representative of the average fanfiction reader. A lot of them are much more casual about it, are reading his stuff because they're bitter over Harry and Hermione not getting together, and either don't care or simply don't notice the overuse of cliches, white knighting, and Mary Sue-ing.

It's also a guilty pleasure for some people that like that kind of stuff. I don't personally like his works, but I've read other fiction that is low quality, but which I still enjoyed.
