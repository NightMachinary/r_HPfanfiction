Because he puts out a prodigious quantity of bland, HHr flavoured, tension-free mush that appeals to the lowest common denominators of the Harry Potter fandom. I don't know why people are calling his writing 'technically sound', because he overuses run-on sentences something dreadful. His grasp of punctuation is spotty at best, and the overall structure/flow of his pieces are a fucking train wreck. It's just that he can put out a lot of it at regular intervals, and it's practically already been digested once, so it never actually stresses your average reader with anything like romantic tension or conflict.

Robst is a bad author, but most people don't actually care about that, hence Dan Brown's popularity in certain circles. It's like pop music. Most people don't care that pop music reuses the same four chords to produce its signature sound. Pop music is incredibly popular, go figure. It doesn't generally try to challenge anyone's sensibilities, appeals to very basic/universal concepts, and usually makes people 'feel good'. Its popularity and ubiquitous nature produces conformity, and produces a sort of positive feedback effect. This is the same with Robst, where people insist that he's 'not a bad author' and put his crap on recommended reading lists, and so he becomes more popular, despite his writing being demonstrably terrible.

Incidentally, wasn't In This World And The Next the one where 'Harry' and 'Hermione' deliver 'justice' to the Weasley family for grievances in an alternate timeline? Robst's stuff is full of these petty and often violent revenge fantasies, of the sort a teenager might concoct without considering the consequences. I suspect that this is because a large subsection of the fanfiction population are either too young or too lacking in empathy to understand morality outside of a black/white context. If someone wrongs the Potters, they are generally willing to do just about anything in return, with little consideration of morals. So... there are legitimately a large portion people who don't see anything wrong with the above, and they're /not/ sociopaths, medically speaking. They just... don't think about it enough to see the blood-drenched elephant in the room. I doubt Robst sees it himself. He never did strike me as much of a philosopher.
