He's generic. His stories are the equivalent of a loaf of bread - standard, filling but not incredibly nutritious, not horrible but not particularly delicious either - and so a lot of different people read them. I'd also probably assume that a lot of his readers are new to fanfiction, and so aren't tired of cliches and bashing. Iirc, Harry Crow was the third fanfiction I read, and while I didn't finish it, I got about half the way through before I switched to something else and added a favourite to come back to later.

His bashing is annoying, but the hero worship of the protagonist makes up for it in terms of tone of the story. It always feels like Harry is right, everyone else is wrong but the reader is on the 'good' team. Of course, that only holds up to a certain point but it's enough to get less experienced readers without as much trope exposure hooked.
