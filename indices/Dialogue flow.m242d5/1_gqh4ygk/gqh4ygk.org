What dialogue?

That shouldn't be my first response. Dialogue should, in almost every instance, start a paragraph. I shouldn't be able to scroll through the entirety of your story and see only one instance of where that occurs.

That instance is also punctuated wrong. The comma, which given you have a character exclaim should probably be an exclamation point....should be within the quotation mark.

Any changing of speaker should also start a new paragraph.

"You're flow problems," Said TheEndless7 while pondering how [[/u/rpeh]] will make a wisecrack about that. "Likely stem from formatting errors. If you correct the formatting it should improve the flow."

"Sort of like plumbing," Rpeh added. "If the pipes are all corrected right the flow works out better and I can get the syrup directly onto my waffles while I cheer on Manchester United in the morning."

"You know I hate you, right?" TheEndless7 sighed in exasperation.

Fix the punctuation and formatting and then focus more on a dichotomy between dialogue and action and it will likely work itself out. Having dialogue occur mid paragraph s almost never correct, or wise.

I'd also suggest thinking about how people actually talk. You have sort of a children's book style conversation occurring in chapter two with a whole conversation happening in one Paragraph that should be changed to be more like.

"We are so thrilled for our engagement," Bellatrix exclaimed.

"When will it be?" Narcissa asked.

"It will be on Valentines day at our house!"

This comes off very "Is this your cat?" "No this is not my cat it's too green." "Is this your cat?" "No this is not my cat is is too orange." "Is this your cat?" "No that's not my cat its an angry Scotsman trying to eviscerate you for implying he likes Manchester United."

The flow there is nothing like how people communicate. For one, you're already talking about parties of the like so there should be some sort of assumed knowledge. Half the chapter is about invitations but Narcissa has no idea when her sister's party is?" And the vocabulary seems off, it's like they're referring to a wedding as an engagement. Which is technically correct, but again not how people talk. While I normally scoff at people who say 'I'd do it like" well, I'd do it like:

"I'm so excited form my wedding!" Bellatrix exclaimed.

"You're doing it on Valentines day, right?" Narcissa asked.

"Yes, we're hoping to keep it low-key to avoid ministry interference," Bellatrix affirmed.

Half of what you say in the prose should just be put into the dialogue and removed from the prose. Otherwise you get choppy dialogue that accomplishes nothing other than bloating paragraphs.
