Hair growing back IS CANON. Petunia cut everything except his bangs (to hide his 'ugly' scar). Harry fretted about how he would be teased the next day at school, and by the morning it seemed like petunia had done nothing at all. School roof is canon. There's also turning some annoying teacher's wig blue, and she told Petunia. I'm pretty sure the only instance of healing is when Harry gets pushed by Dudley and breaks his arm, and it heals. All I can remember, correct me if I'm wrong.

Edit: Opened up the book because I can. Chapter 2, pg 24 in American hardback version. In addition to what I listed before: Petunia was trying to force Harry in to 'a revolting old sweater', but it just kept shrinking until it 'might have fitted a hand puppet.' Oh and vanishing the glass in the snake exhibit at the zoo. I also remember the door to the cupboard under the stairs blew open of its own accord after the Marge incident. Huh. No mention of turning his teachers wig blue. I was so sure it was canon.
