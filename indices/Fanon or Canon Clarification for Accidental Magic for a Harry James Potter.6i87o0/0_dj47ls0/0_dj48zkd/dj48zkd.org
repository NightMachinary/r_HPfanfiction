I too, am sure that the wig blue thing is canon. I'm sure I can find it

EDIT: Ah, here we are: " Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue"

No wonder I was having a hard time finding it, it's all the way on chapter 7, when Harry is wating to be sorted.
