Hair growing back is, as others have pointed out, canon. A very common fan interpretation is that this is a sign that Harry is really a Metamorphmagus... but I don't really buy it.

We saw how Tonks altered her appearance at a whim, and even her son was changing his hair colour readily when he was only a few hours old. Seems to me more likely that what happened was that Harry unwittingly performed a [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hair-thickening_Charm][Hair-Thickening Charm]], or some variant thereof.
