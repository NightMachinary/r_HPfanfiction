You might like /A Riddled Universe/ linkffn(8678567). It's been a very long time since I read it, so I don't recall much how good it was, but the premise was interesting. I believe that there were some strange pairings (I want to say Snape was married to Lily), but I honestly don't recall. I also don't quite recall how prominent Riddle really was (e.g. if he was a deuteragonist; Harry was definitely the protagonist), but his character was critical to the story.
