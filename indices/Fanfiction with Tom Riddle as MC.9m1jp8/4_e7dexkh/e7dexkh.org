I'm not trying to be a jerk, but I just want to clarify the post flairs for you, since this is actually a request post.

────────

*Fic Search:*

When you are looking for a *single, specific fic*. There is a story on your mind that you /know/ exists, and you know a list of things about it, but you still need help finding it. Most commonly used because you have forgotten the title of a story you previously read, or because your google-fu can't find a fic the author seems to have removed from FFN/AO3/etc

*Request:*

When you are looking for *any fics that fit within some general guidelines*. You post fits this exactly, listing some requirements ("he has to be a protagonist or at least a deuteragonist", etc) and some preferences ("I prefer no shipping with Riddle", etc). This is by far the most common post type here, used to gain recommendations for new fics the OP expects to enjoy due to the guidelines shared.

────────

After all that, go forth and enjoy the stories shared! I hope your post nets you good new fics to read :)
