Yes but he still did play around with magic is what I meant. At least if im remembering this correctly. Despite facing reprocussion for it. Maybe it was a rebellious thing but he still did it.

I mean not like Voldemorts orphanage super wanted him to use magic either or was the nicest place but he still played around with it.

As opposed to say being muggleborn and like not wanting to accidentally set fire to the couch because your parents cant easily fix that with magic or be exposed to your friends because what if they think youre creepy. Or what if the neighbors see you. Its not really anyones fault its just no one really knew how to help muggleborns feel free to play with their magic in enviroments with other muggle with the secrecy laws and all. So instead they tried to be more inclusive with their curriculum and this was the idea they came up with. And here are the consequences.

At least thats the theory I came across it was on reddit but like years ago and i didnt bookmark it so I cant find it. But it does sorta make sense. And I think a pretty interesting setup to put stories in.
