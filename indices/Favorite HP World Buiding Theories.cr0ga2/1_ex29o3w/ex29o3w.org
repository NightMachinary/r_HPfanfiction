I have some favorites, though the canonicity is probably variable:

- Magic appears to be of multiple components (much of it symbolic) in all its forms. In the case of wandwork, there are a set of principles and patterns that /can/ make a spell work. However, these are just tools for teaching those who aren't able to yet (if at all) shape magic to their intent in the specific manner. This is where much of the wizarding specializations descends from - certain people have minds/personalities more geared toward shape, or the abstract, or violence, etc.
- All living creatures are magical. However, this is largely dormant in most cases unless specific characteristics or features appear in individuals or beasts (think Grindelwald's line of 'Magic blooms in rare souls'). This explains why squibs are sometimes born, or where muggleborns come from - they have just the right qualities physically to manifest magic. This also explains why things like seers and metamorphmagi are seemingly related to parentage, despite the dubious blood-magic connections.
- A lot more of the magic creatures that exist are products of magical breeding/manipulation by wizards than the WW would have you believe. Not all of them, but it can't just be acromantulas and other dark creatures.
- There are more ways to combat or control dementors than we are told in canon. Harry's mention offhandedly of Snape disagreeing on how to handle them may imply this as well. I doubt you can kill them per se, but its likely you can contain or starve them of sustenance, since they grow from damp, decay and misery (equivalent to magical mold). Possibly something fire-based for instance, as they prefer cold and dark environments, or even just warmth.
- The Patronus spell is not the only spell so heavily based on positive emotional catharsis. Others could exist, but we aren't provided real evidence for that either. I doubt no one has noticed their connection though. Also, part of the reason its so seemingly difficult to learn is the same reason its difficult to learn the Unforgiveables (Harry's Imperio not withstanding) - you need to be able to call forth the emotions effortlessly, rather than specifically focus on feeling happy or gleeful or hateful and so on (see first point).
