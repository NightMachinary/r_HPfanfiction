Transfiguration changes the /figure/, aka the "Properties" of an object. So if you try to transfigure lead into gold, you get lead that looks, feels, weighs, etc the same as gold but it's still lead. On the one side this allows to transfigure things that would be impossible without magic like wood that has the strength of metal or animals that think like humans, on the other side if you don't know how to magically express a property (such as radioactive half-life) you can't transfigure something with this property.
