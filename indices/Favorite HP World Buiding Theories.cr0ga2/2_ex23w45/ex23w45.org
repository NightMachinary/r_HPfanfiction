I love the idea that each person has a different magical imprint and so performs the same spell differently from another person, getting similar results but in their own style. For example, the school might teach one way of performing the spell and this way might work for the majority but there will be ppl who struggle with it and who will probably learn it in a different way (a bit like muggle school where every student has a different learning style but are made to all learn the same way ).

I love this because it would mean that instead of a world where every spell is performed in the same way, we get a world full of colourful personal interpretations. This would mean that, for example, famous wizards would have famous magical imprints or styles and so would be easier to recognize if needed.
