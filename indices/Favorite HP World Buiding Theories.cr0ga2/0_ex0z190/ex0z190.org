Magical theory breaks down into two mutually exclusive categories. Literal and Symbolic. They can interact with each other, but they aren't part of the same thing.

Literal magic

#+begin_quote
  behaves almost like energy in that the concept of an "amount" of magic determines how successful or accurately a "spell" is conveyed. It's not exactly quantitative, but behaves as though it were quantitative. It can account for variation in how corporeal a Patronus appears or how well an object is levitated. A more accurate account would be how "real" the magic becomes.

  It's not as simple as draining some amount of magic from some sort of magical core and pushing it into a spell, but it seems like it.

  Discussions with [[/u/Taure]] make me think this is related to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid][Platonic solids in some way (and therefore the elements: earth, air, water, and fire)]].

Symbolic magic

#+begin_quote
  behaves like the magic transfer of metaphysical concepts into physical results. The classic example of this would be potions where an annual plant might represent the cycle of life and death, so could be used in a Draught of Living Death. This would also account for things like Transfiguration or Conjuration which are often absent in hard magic realism systems because they breaks the laws of physics and don't behave in a quantitative manner (like energy).

  This isn't only limited to subjective symbols that exist in a single person's head, but also can extend to collective symbols like runes or incantations.

  Again, discussions with [[/u/Taure]] make me think this is something like pulling [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms][Platonic Forms]] into reality.

The interaction between the two forms of magic would account for how you can conjure food, but can't eat it because while symbolic magic accounts for the ability to conjure it at all, it's too complex to become fully literal in it's intended Form. On the other hand, conjuring water is much more straight forward, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kepler_Icosahedron_Water.jpg][because water is the symbolic analog to the icosahedron Platonic solid]], so it can be permanently conjured in it's physical Form.

I imagine Gamp's law references the biplay between the Literal and the Symbolic theories of magic as applied to Conjuration.

It's also conceivable that magic itself is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(classical_element)][Fifth Element]] as described by Plato and Aristotle, later called Aether, but I don't necessarily see that as being in conflict with the idea that Aether is the combination of the four elements giving birth to Forms.
