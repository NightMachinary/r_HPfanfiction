I accidentally stumbled on summary of this fic and remembered your fic request, seems to fit quite well linkffn(harry evans: outcast by Herne) By the way, have you read book series The Dresden files by Jim Butcher? It has quite amazing hidden magical world full of winter and summer court fairies, vampires, old gods - basically author at point or another has incorporated in his series almost all myths and deities, well, a variation of them.
