Yes? I don't think of it as being a particular porn-y fic but they do have sex but I think it's the conversation around it for the most part that's explicit, not so much the actual sex. But yes, any actual sex scenes you should be able to skip without consequence, but I'm pretty sure that the tag is more for some frank conversation about the fact that sex is going to happen.
