The first three are Snape/Harry recs:

We're just embarking on a readalong over at [[/r/SnarryBookClub][r/SnarryBookClub]] of The Forest King, linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17509988/chapters/41246642]]) by drawlight, a fic that heavily incorporates Celtic mythology and folklore. (The author often includes fairy tale and folkloric elements in their work, so if you like this one, check out their other fic.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/172866][Requiem at Dusk]] by femmequixotic, mixes together concepts from various mythologies about the Underworld and uses the Orpheus myth as a starting point. Locked to AO3.

Full disclosure, this one's mine: The Lost World, linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/729180]]), fairy tale and garden of Eden references.

The Stolen Child, linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29726]]) by Delphi, Dumbledore/Snape, based on British folklore and a Yeats poem

[[https://severus-shorts.livejournal.com/13205.html][A Rowan in Winter]] by Duniazade, Snape family gen. This feels like it's drawing upon a magical or folkloric background, but it may not be specific.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/519517][The Bone Mother]] by rinsbane, Andromeda/Bellatrix, Andromeda/Ted Tonks, a story that draws upon the Baba Yaga folktale. Locked to AO3.
