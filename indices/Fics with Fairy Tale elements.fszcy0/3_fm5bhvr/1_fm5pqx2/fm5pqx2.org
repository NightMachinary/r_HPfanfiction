Snarry is the pairing term, right? So, they're together? Is there actual development toward them getting together in those first three, or are they the usual "They're in close proximity, now they bang!" type short-burn relationship fics? I'm not complaining either way, I'd just like to know where to set my expectations in that regard. If Snape isn't a bitter, bullying twat like canon, it's good to have some explanation.

I do love Yeats, and The Stolen Child was a pretty good poem. Even Torchwood quoted it once. :)

Ah, Baba Yaga. I've used her for D&D things often. Sounds good. And is Andromeda-Bella a romantic incestuous pairing? Again, just checking to set expectations.
