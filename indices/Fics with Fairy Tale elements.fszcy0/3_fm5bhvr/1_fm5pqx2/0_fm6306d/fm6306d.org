I haven't read the first one yet, but I've read other fics by the author, so I'm confident it's a slow-burn development and Snape is his bitter self. He's not as much of a bully in the second; he's more stern and subdued. There's some development in the third, but I was more concerned with fairytale/metaphysical matters.

Andromeda/Bella is an incestuous pairing, yes, but I wouldn't call it romantic. The story is meant to be creepy and unsettling.

ETA: I saw your question about sex addressed to another reccer, and in light of that, you may want to skip The Lost World and The Bone Mother.
