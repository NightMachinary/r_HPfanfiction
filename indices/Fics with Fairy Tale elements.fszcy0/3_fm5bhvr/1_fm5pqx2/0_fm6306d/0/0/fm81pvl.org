I don't think being a "Nazi twat" comes up in any of the fic, so as with all shipfic, YMMV in regards to plausibility.

For Lost World, you shouldn't lose track of the plot if you skip the sex. I enjoy writing sex scenes, but they have to carry some of the story's weight. They're not just decoration. In this fic, they're part of the intensity, the seduction of the garden, the temptation to run away from increasing melancholy. It's meant to be erotic, but the scenes also have a thematic job to do, especially as the story is more about atmosphere than plot, and about the encounter with an older fairy tale type of magic and an older sense of fate.

With Bone Mother, it's a given that the Black family see morality and love through a very different lens. There's no dating involved. There are power plays and possessiveness underlying everything, and Bella is the most important person in Andromeda's life. The sex scenes are part of the whole incestuous fascination, the decadence that runs in a family raised to believe in power and superiority.

I don't think I can give a conclusive answer in either case. You can give them a try, and if the sexual aspect bothers or bores you, just move on to a different story. In terms of acceptable levels, only you can decide what works for you and what doesn't.
