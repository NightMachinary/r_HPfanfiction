  "Nazi twat"

Fair enough. Like I said, it's not about plausibility, any trope or pairing can be fun/interesting if it's done right and I'm not remotely attached to any headcanons, it's just about setting expectations. Expecting one version of that kind of pairing and getting another has always rankled slightly (the ambiguity is generally not done too well when pairing what is essentially the Magical Equivalent of a Nazi and a Half-Jewish Person), so I like to check beforehand so I know if I'm getting something where Snape and Draco grow from their canon selves or are just stuck in Leather Pants and claimed to have been nice all the while. For additional clarification, I'm definitely not saying either version is good or bad, they can both be interesting and fun. Checking in advance which it is just seems to get me more fun/interesting stories where it happens. It's how I found the few Harry-Bellatrix fics I've actually liked, for example.

  For Lost World

Hmm, okay. That's good to know. I'm the kind of asexual where eroticism is completely lost on me - I find sex scenes about as entertaining as football matches, and I fell asleep at the only stadium match I went to. :D

It's a very interesting approach, though. Kind of reminds me of a mix of the Goblin Markets poem and a novel I read called Spellcast! by Barbara Ashford. The novel had a similar aspect of sexuality being thematically entwined with the seduction (though of the Theatre, instead of a Garden - and I see where the Edenite references come in :D). Hmm. I'll give them a try - I did actually enjoy the scenes in Spellcast somewhat, given how they furthered the plot and themes of the story.

  With Bone Mother

Huh. That all sounds very Freudian. The Psychologist in me is curious, now. What the hell. I'm giving Lost World a try, I can give Bone Mother a go too.

  only you can decide what works for you and what doesn't
#+end_quote

Sure, but that doesn't mean I can't value the opinions of others. I've been convinced to try fics that I never would've myself that I've enjoyed immensely. Never any harm in getting input and advice, even if you disregard it entirely. You've certainly changed my perspective somewhat. :)
