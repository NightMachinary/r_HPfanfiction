Well, that's good. Like I said, I was just checking. I don't mind fics that take the un-canonical approach, I just like to be aware of what I'm reading so I don't go in expecting full development and find a "Snape was always nice all along, he was just forced to be a Nazi twat" or "You're hot, I'm hot, let's bang!". Setting expectations and all that. :)

Romantic in a simple "They're together" sense rather than a candle-lit dinners sense, I mean. Like, are they dating or just fucking?

In regard to Lost World and Bone Mother, are they overly smutty to the point where if I skip the sex I'll lose the thread of the plot? I can deal with my boredom in regard to sex scenes for a good plot, and those two do sound like interesting concepts with good plots.
