Ah, you've recommended this to me before in the 'fics with different magic systems' thread. I just finished it yesterday and really enjoyed it - though I was amused at how much of the Gentleman Bastard series I could see in it, Joe had definitely just got done reading that when he wrote that one. :D

So yes, thanks for the rec (again)! :D
