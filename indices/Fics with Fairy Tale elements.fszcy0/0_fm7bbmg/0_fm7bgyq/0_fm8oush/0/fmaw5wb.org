Heh. Most of Joe's fics are. He's great at writing epic and mysterious feeling things. If you like this fic, I'd recommend you actually go and read The Gentleman Bastard series by Scott Lynch. It's more thievery than drug-dealing, but it's got a very similar real-ness and mystique-worldbuilding to it.
