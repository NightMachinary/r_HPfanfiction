In all seriousness, the only one that I can honestly recommend is linkffn(8262940). The writing is so far and beyond better than 99.99% of the fandom that you can forgive the flimsy plot. I'd also recommend Intoxication, but the author(s) pulled all of their fics, and it's also quite telling when on of the best HP/DG stories is one in which Daphne dies... There's also link(2859327). All of the stories linked so far in this thread are interchangeable and pretty much just the same thing rewritten in slightly different ways.
