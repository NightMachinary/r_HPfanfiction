I liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5864749/1/Ice-Princess][Ice Princess]], linkffn(5864749). It's short and actually rather sweet.

There's also [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Situations/Perfect_Situations/][Perfect Situations]] which is a twist on the usual Daphne/Harry trope with a interesting presentation. There's also the sequel [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Matryoshka_Vignettes/index/][Matryoshka Vignettes]] but I thought that while still pretty good, just couldn't capture the magic of the original.
