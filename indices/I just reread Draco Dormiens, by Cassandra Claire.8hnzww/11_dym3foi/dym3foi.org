I read these as they were being published back in the day (am An Old), and I do think that the plagiarism "controversy" is a bit blown out of proportion. Claire was about as above board with using lines from other shows as one can be. The end of every chapter included a list of which lines were from which shows to the best of her ability. She did admit that she collected quotes and didn't always write down where they were from, but when we're already within the realm of using someone else's IP (fanfiction), I don't think it's such a great crime to use other sources, too. Especially since she /did/ cite hers.
