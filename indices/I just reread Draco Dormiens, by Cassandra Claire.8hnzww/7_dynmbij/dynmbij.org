What I think people have forgotten is that it was way more than just a couple of Buffy and Blackadder quotes. I recently reread the original blog postings that were written by the person who caught the plagiarism, and what they caught was huge passages that were taken from a published series of books that were out of print at the time. This person actually posted CC's passages next to the book's passages, and essentially proved that CC would have had to have the book in her lap because it was that verbatim. Once that broke, others started pulling more and more things that were taken as well as not cited in CC's little author notes. Almost every fic she had, every really cool scene, the funniest lines, etc none of it was hers. It makes you wonder how she got her publishing deal.

Facts: The Mortal Instruments was also a title of a Ron/Ginny fic that CC wrote. Jace is Draco. Clary is Ginny.
