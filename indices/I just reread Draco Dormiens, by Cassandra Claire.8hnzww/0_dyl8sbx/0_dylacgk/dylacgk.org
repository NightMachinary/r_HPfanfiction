I haven't read any of her professionally published work, so I can't comment on that.

However, after reading Draco Dormiens I think that it would be easy to use a similar dynamic between the main three characters in an original YA fantasy fiction. After all, this triangle was not part of the Harry Potter canon, and then you can have these archetypes:

1) The "bad" boy hero, who turns out to be good, although he still enjoys being difficult, sarcastic and snarky.

2) The "good" boy hero, a more classic teen fantasy hero, who has a rivalry with the bad boy and can keep up with him in terms of snarkiness.

3) The smart girl hero, meant to be a proxy for the female teenage reader.

Both boys then fall for the girl, and she's attracted to both of them and agonizing over which one is right for her. The three are forced by circumstances to join forces against a common foe, and that makes the two boys start developing a grudging respect for each other, and ultimately forming a brotherly bond.

I mean, this is YA 101. If you get that in the hands of a competent writer it's difficult not to appeal to the target audience.

In that sense, writing the fanfic could be seen as training for writing the original series. It does not seem wrong to me. I mean, triangles like that are commonplace in YA literature, what makes the difference is how well they are written.

Of course, with the original series the author cannot plagiarize any lines or passages from other authors...
