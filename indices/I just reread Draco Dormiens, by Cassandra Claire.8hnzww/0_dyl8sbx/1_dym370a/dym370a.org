It's been years since I've read either the Draco trilogy or City of Bones, but from what I remember, only Draco's character was basically copy/pasted in to CoB (as Jace?). There's one scene that was lifted word-for-word out of DD and put into CoB, but I recall Claire herself saying she did that because she like the scene so much she wanted to use it in her "real" book. Some people were pissy about that for some reason, but she wrote it, she can put it wherever she wants IMO.

The other two main characters weren't any more similar to Harry or Hermione than your standard YA character tropes that [[/u/farseer2]] described.
