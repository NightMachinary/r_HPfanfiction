TBH, I do still think it is a big deal within fanfiction. It's notable that when it came to the more popular excerpts, they were either altered slightly or short. Longer excerpts were from lesser-known works (at least, to her target demographic). I think that very consciously points towards plagiarism and, worse, that she didn't care so long as she thought she wouldn't get caught.

Ultimately, she's a professional, established author and has put a lot of this behind her. But I can't help but wonder what, in her original works, might she have plagiarized if she cared so little for crediting artists before.
