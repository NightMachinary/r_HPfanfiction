I remember this, even though I was so young at the time. I'm a bookseller these days and I have still been quietly boycotting her actual books all these years. It doesn't seem like that big of a deal in retrospect, but it really rubbed me the wrong way for years, so I refuse to read anything else she's written. Especially knowing that her published characters are basically her HP ones, renamed.
