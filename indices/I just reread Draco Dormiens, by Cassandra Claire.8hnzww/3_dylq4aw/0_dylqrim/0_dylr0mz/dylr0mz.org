Luckily (for me) I hit a wall at some point and stopped being interested in the genre, so I'm not even tempted. I secretly judge other bookish people for reading her books, especially the fannish type, but I realize that's probably me holding a silly grudge for way too long. I just keep away from her myself.

It's a shame, I want to be happy for and supportive of fic writers who become published career authors. But I only really know about the shitty ones, lol.
