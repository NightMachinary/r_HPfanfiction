I read the Draco trilogy as she was posting it in the early 2000s, also why I didn't pay attention in class a lot. It was and still is one of the amazing fanfics I read! It has its own place for me, but truly opened my eyes to where fanfiction could go. Also my friends and I used so many of those jokes as inside jokes it was a bit crazy.

I don't agree with what she did later with her own novels, and they never really appealed to me. I have to agree it's definitely one of those grey areas of plagiarism.
