  I have to agree it's definitely one of those grey areas of plagiarism.

For me there's no gray area in plagiarism: There's no excuse using someone else's work (intentionally) and not giving credit or marking it as a quote. I understand inspiration and sometimes we don't remember where we got an idea from, but as soon as you start to copy things word for word and presenting it as your own there's no excuses: you're scum.
