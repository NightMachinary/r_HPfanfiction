This is quite interesting. I got into both reading and writing fanfiction pretty late in my life, probably around 2008 or so, and I haven't had the chance to really look up its evolution and how it came to be. I mean it makes me think of how the Fifty Shades series was basically initially a fanfiction based off Twilight. I adore fanfiction and I know of some fanfiction that are almost if not just as good as canon. I also have not read Draco Dormiens and it seems like the perfect plot that I would enjoy so now I have another on my reading list!
