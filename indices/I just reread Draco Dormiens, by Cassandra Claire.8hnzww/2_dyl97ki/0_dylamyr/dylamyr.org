You're welcome. I think this fanfic is interesting because it's enjoyable and also because, if you love Harry Potter fanfiction, this is part of the history of the genre, and it had a large influence in attracting new authors and readers and defining some of the tropes.

Of course, it's also part of the infamous history of the genre because of its fall from grace due to the plagiarism controversy and the bitter war it caused among the fandom.
