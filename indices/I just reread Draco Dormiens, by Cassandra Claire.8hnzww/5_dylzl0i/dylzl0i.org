  Among the secondary characters, I was surprised by how wise Sirius was. Not the grudge-holding, act-before-you-think Sirius from canon.

That makes sense, actually, if it was published prior to OotP. In GoF, Sirius took risks to talk to Harry, but their conversations were full of good insight and advice. It's when he's imprisoned again that he slips into angry, sullen, grudge-holding borderline prick. For understandable reasons.

I haven't read any of Claire's stuff - either fanfic or professional - and I still remain skeptical. But I enjoyed your review and commentary.
