Yes, I agree with this. I do not care that she used some one-liners from Blackadder or Buffy in her fanfiction if she credited them. Fanfiction is about borrowing and doing something cool with what you borrow, as long as you don't make money and don't try to take credit for what you borrow. The uncredited "borrowing" is just wrong, even more so when it's more than a single quote, and you are taking a whole passage, as she did in chapter 9 of the third book.

Having said that, and while it's good she was exposed, for me this does not delete the merits that this trilogy has, and I certainly do not wish the author any harm in her professional career. She did wrong but she has already paid for it, in my opinion, with all the bitter criticism she has received.
