I never really had a huge hateboner for CC. I read the Draco Trilogy long after fanfiction left the leatherpants!Draco phase behind and found it to be... good. I have issues with it, of course, but there's lots of cool ideas, and some genuinely good writing in there. I don't know how that might have carried over into her original fiction.

As I recall, she always credited the single lines she borrowed from things like Blackadder, so I didn't see a problem there. What was apparently the problem (though I only know about it secondhand) was her uncredited borrowing from The Hidden Land by Pamela Dean. Apparently (and this is supported by comprehensive documents "exposing" CC is you care to look for them) she lifted entire passages from that book into her fanfic, without crediting this time. That's the part that ticked people off, as far as I know.

As for copypasting characters into her original fiction, I can confirm that's true. Having seen the movie City of Bones, there's a scene in it that's easily recognizable from the Draco Trilogy, I think from the second installment.

That said, I don't have a problem with this. The parts of her fanfic that she created (like that scene) are hers, regardless of being placed in JK's world. I think it's fine to transplant something into original fiction if you think it's good enough.
