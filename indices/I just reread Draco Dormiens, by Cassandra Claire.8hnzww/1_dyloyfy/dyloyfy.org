I remember enjoying this in my early days, but really falling out with it when I realized all the cleverest, funniest bits I really enjoyed were directly ripped from other sources. Like, dozens in a chapter, entire lengthy conversations between characters. The color of humor wasn't even hers - it was ripped from dozens of more talented people with zero credit. It really discolored my opinion of her writing - when you can't tell if what you're enjoying is just copy/paste repurposed. How am I supposed to think her characterization of Draco is good when so many of the snarky words she put in his mouth she pulled out of someone else's character's?

Overall meh. When all the memorable pieces of your story were written by someone else, I think you're less a talented writer than someone with a good eye for putting together what people like. That she's clearly very good at.
