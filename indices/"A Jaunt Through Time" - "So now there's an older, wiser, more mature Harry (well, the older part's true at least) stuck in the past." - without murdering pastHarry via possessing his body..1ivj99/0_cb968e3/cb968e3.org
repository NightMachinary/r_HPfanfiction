Cool story, but traveling into your younger body doesn't actually kill your younger self. If time-travel kills yourself, then there's no way you could grow up and do the time traveling. It would be like the grandfather paradox. Therefore, young-you has to persist in some form, likely in the old timeline, while your time travel just creates a new, alternate timeline.

It's a stupid nitpick, but I hate it when time-travel stories can't get their physics right.
