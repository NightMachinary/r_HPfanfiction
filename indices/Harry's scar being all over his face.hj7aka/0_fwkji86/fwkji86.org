Personally I also prefer the traditional lightning bolt (both for nostalgia reasons and because I like the symbolism of its runic form), but I can definitely see the appeal of a branching style scar. Firstly it adds weight to other characters' reactions to his scar (horrible scar...scar head...etc) which, with a smaller and less noticeable scar are far less cutting. It also adds another dimension to Harry's difficulty covering it up, whereas in canon the scar could be hidden with a hat or fringe. Another reason authors might choose a literal lightning scar is for the aesthetic - I've seen a lot of fanart of this sort and it does look pretty cool. Writers could also use the scar as an excuse for a personality change, for example Harry could be a lot more self conscious of his scar and perhaps more timid. I think it would also be interesting that when Harry's scar bleeds it would be much more extreme and horrifying than in canon. Honestly I've not seen much of it in fic, mostly just headcanons and fanart, so I think it just depends on what you're reading.
