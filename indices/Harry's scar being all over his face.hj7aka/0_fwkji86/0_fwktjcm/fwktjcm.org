Ooh, that's an interesting aspect I hadn't considered before - that it gives more weight to people's reactions to Harry's scar, which the much smaller and less noticeable canon version doesn't necessarily warrant.

Thinking about it, I think the reason why that never occurred to me is because there are two ways of looking at the scar: the visual (it's noticeable, or not so much), or the metaphorical. I never questioned characters' reactions because I didn't really take the visual much into account (other than that it's in an obvious place and thus easy to spot) and ascribed it to the metaphorical; the scar is the (rumoured) remnant of the Killing Curse, which everyone is justifiably terrified of, and is also the symbol of Harry's fame. Which is why Draco attacks it and derides it, simultaneously also deriding the people who flock to Harry. So to me there was never a disparity. But that is a very interesting nuance, thank you for providing your thoughts!

With regards to how it looks - the first time I saw it I thought it was an interesting interpretation, but I gave it the same amount of attention that I'd give fanart where they wear interesting outfits. So I think when I saw it more and more from various sources it started to frustrate me, because I just didn't get it. But "it just looks cool" is a perfectly valid reason, just not one I took into account.

Yeah, I spend most of my HP fanfic time in niches, so if there are only 10 writers and 5 of them start to add a new trend to their stories, it can seem a lot more popular than it actually is.
