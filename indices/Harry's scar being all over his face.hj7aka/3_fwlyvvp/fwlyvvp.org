There's a collection of one-shots which includes a story where Harry's scar gets made far worse due to a childhood "prank" gone wrong. Since the prank include hydrochloric acid... Harry ends up wearing a mask to cover his half-ruined face.

Sadly, The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10280808/33/Little-Whinging-Pet-Shop][Phantom Of Hogwarts]] stops just as Harry gets Sorted into Slytherin, but the author notes that it is up for adoption by anyone who wants it (as are the other one-shots)
