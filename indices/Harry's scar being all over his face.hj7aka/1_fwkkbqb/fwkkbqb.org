I can see, for a fem!Harry, an actually disfiguring scar would be more interesting because women are judged on their appearance more than men are.

I'm working on a thing where, when Harry does evil things, or at least things that Tom would especially approve of, the scar gets a little bigger and angrier looking, but it stops short of taking over his eye. Well, it's a possibility, it'll get cut if I can't find anything interesting to do with it.
