Yeah I see where you're coming from, I just kind of feel like there are already more than enough interesting things going on in Harry's life, particularly the reinterpretation of canon for fem!Harry (did she still have to wear Dudley's clothes? What impact did that, plus her relatives' vastly different body types, have on Harry's own body image?). Plus, any scar at all in the face would already be experienced very differently by fem!Harry.

Now see, that I think is very interesting and I wouldn't have any issue whatsoever with that, because the changing of the scar from canon serves a very clear purpose.

I think I'm starting to narrow down that my issue is that there isn't really a point to changing Harry's scar (for the stories I'm talking about I mean, not for yours or for other stories in which there is a purpose). I find that frustrating. (I mean, even changing Harry into goth!Harry serves a purpose; whether I personally am into that is a different matter.)

Thank you for your input!
