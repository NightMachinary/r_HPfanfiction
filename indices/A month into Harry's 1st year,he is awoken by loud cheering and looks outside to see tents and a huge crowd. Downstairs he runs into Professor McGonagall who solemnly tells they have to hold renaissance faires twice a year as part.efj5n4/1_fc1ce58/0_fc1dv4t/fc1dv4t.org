This was exact thought on seeing the title and what I clicked to post! I actually have friends involved in historical sword fighting and forging, and they are lucky to get a slot as entertainment at country fairs let alone a whole event designed around the medieval. One notable exception is Colchester which holds a medieval fair that is fairly well attended by the general public.
