No. Purebloods are magical offspring born from two purebloods. Muggleborns are magical offspring born from two muggles. Any magical human born from any combination other than this two is a Halfblood. Squibs are not another category. They are muggles born from magicals(opposite of a muggleborn).

Once your line stops being considered pure, It wont be considered pure again for a long, long time(potentially for centuries until "impurity" is forgotten). Harrys children are considered Halfbloods in canon despite Ginny being a pureblood.
