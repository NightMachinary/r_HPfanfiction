Consider that those who truly care about this nowadays are bigoted and won't be as accepting as you seem to be. Now, consider that everyone else just uses the same system to determine blood status because they were just raised with it and why bother creating another one. Now, consider that literally everyone in Canon considers/calls Harry a half-blood.

The Blood Purity system is almost copy-pasted from the racial segregation chart of the nazis, and so is based according to grandparents, not only parents. Now, consider that Lily Potter n√©e Evans is a 'Mudblood' by purist standards, since, despite having magic, she still has no magical heritage whatsoever. Blood purity is largely biological, but there's still a small cultural aspect to it. Lily and Harry Potter were raised as Muggles until the age of eleven, and so are outsiders to the magical world.
