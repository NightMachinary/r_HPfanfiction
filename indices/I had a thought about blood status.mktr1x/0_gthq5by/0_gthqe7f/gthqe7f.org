That still doesn't make sense to me lol because I look at it like james was obv pureblood, but lily was muggle born (which means she /had/ magical blood). I look at like like magical blood+ magical blood should produce what's considered pureblood offspring.

Not that any of this matters, just random thoughts I have lol
