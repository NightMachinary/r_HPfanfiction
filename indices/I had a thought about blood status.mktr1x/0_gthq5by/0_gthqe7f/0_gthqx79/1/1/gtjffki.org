I think she was basing it off the way Nazis classified people as Jewish or not. Meaning, if you had no Jewish grandparents then you were clear. If you had 1 or 2 Jewish grandparents you were "mischling", or "mixed breed/halfbreed". She tried to draw parallels between the persecution of muggleborns and the persecution of Jews so it makes sense she'd take elements from how Nazis classified people when designing a xenophobic society's level of acceptance of people with "outsider" heritage.

So it's not what readers would consider logical as "pure", but what the xenophobic wizards in British wizarding society accept as "pure".
