That's my theory too. I reckon families like the Malfoys and Blacks would claim that a pureblood is someone with /no/ muggle blood in their ancestry, which is obviously impossible as the level of inbreeding would have killed them, so they erase all records of muggleborns marrying into the family. And then all the other families would be pulling their hair out like “fuck, how do they have no muggle blood? Quick, claim that Jerry was a bastard pureblood rather than a muggleborn” and it creates this cascading effect where every pureblood family has smudged their records and they each think that they're the imposters when in reality every family is doing it lmao.
