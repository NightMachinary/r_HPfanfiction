I have a 'throw-away' line in one of my books where the Pureblood families all count differently - basically the more prejudiced families count at higher generations because their family heritage goes back centuries. But other, perhaps less-advantaged Pureblood families count at smaller generations because they can't guarantee blood purity past 3-4 generations.

So basically everyone uses the math that suits their own history.
