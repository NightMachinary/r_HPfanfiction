It's actually based on the Nazi's belief of Judaism.

If any of your parents or grandparents were Jewish, you were marked in some way. They had whole diagrams about it but it's similar to what Rowling describes in HP.

If we are following a similar pattern, the average definition of pureblood would be that all your grandparents aren't muggles or muggleborns.

But you have those extra crazy ones (like the gaunts and Blacks) who follow the one drop rule.
