The blood status system is based on real life race caste systems and ideologies like the one-drop rule, so this post is...interesting.

Half-bloods are anyone with a muggle/muggleborn/half-parent as, again, JKR borrows the "logic" of the one-drop rule.

Harry isn't "pure" because his mother is considered "dirty"; a "mudblood." In the simple words of their muggle equivalent: "if there's something wrong with the bitch, there'll be something wrong with the pup."
