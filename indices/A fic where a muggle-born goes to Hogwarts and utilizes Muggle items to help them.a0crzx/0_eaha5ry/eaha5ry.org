I don't mind that fanfic authors have muggleborns bring pens to Hogwarts so much that I mind the narcissistic in-character author-praising circlejerk that necessarily seems to follow, as if bringing pens to Hogwarts is a wholly original concept which no fanfic author has ever thought of, before.

Replace pens with nearly any other muggle invention, and the formula appears to hold true.
