Well, there is that bit in Goblet of Fire where Harry considers Summoning a scuba-diving set from the nearest muggle village. Although I have to question how he'd manage to summon something from ultra-long range like that.

I also saw a fanfic once where Hermione was writing with a muggle pen on paper instead of quill and parchment; Ron had to snatch her homework and toss it in the fire right before it exploded, because apparently the act of writing magic words down is just as magical as saying them and using the quill/parchment animal products helps to 'soak up' the magic. I don't remember what it was, though, it was a one-shot but I dunno if it was in a collection or not.
