This fic ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14462256]]) while clichè and not particularly amazing, had the most multifaceted Lily and James that I've come across, as well as the most multifaceted WGWL. They actually have motivations and more to their personalities than “evil parents” and “spoiled famous brat”.
