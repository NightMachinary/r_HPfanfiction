Linkffn(si vis pacem para bellum) assuming I spelled that right, I found this to be a really interesting fic. It's still work in progress but it really explores the characters of the black family and covers durmstrang as being where the first several years take place. It's not super detailed and get to the triwizard fairly quickly but the durmstrang section is very fleshed out for the time they spend there. It focuses on quidditch, dueling, and character development/relationships. I strongly recommend it even though it's been awhile since the last update, I am confident the story is still going.
