Polyjuice as Harry to torture them, their families, innocent people... "Just give in and I'll stop". Keep twisting reality. Like force Hermione to watch Ginny being tortured, but once its done, it turns out to be someone else (polyjuiced to look like Ginny). Then later "Ginny" is tortured again, only it turns out to really be Ginny. Fake an escape where "Harry" comes to rescue them but really its a DE and its all just to bring up their hopes and crash them down. Do a purposefully botched partial human transfiguration to give them hooves rather than feet, or some other humiliating disfigurement. You could spend a lot of time on their minds & memories being twisted / shredded. Brainwash Hermione into believing in blood purity. ... and with that... I think I need a nice happy story to cleanse my soul...
