Hear me out: the bronze bull, wizard style. Big enough to fit a human lying down or on all fours, it utilises a combination of spells that prevent the heat from going any deeper than the skin and to keep the heart rate below a deadly level, preventing it from affecting any internal organs or blood vessels. It would cause lasting, deep burns in parts of their bodies, psychological damage from being unable to escape the pain by just dying, and their screams would be rather entertaining for people like deatheaters as they'd make the bull roar. It would probably also mess with their core temperature or their perception of temperature and pain.
