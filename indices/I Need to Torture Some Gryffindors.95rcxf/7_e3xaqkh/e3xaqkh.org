I'm going to add in some specific comments as well.

If the goal is to break their spirits, rather than mutilate, then I think a good idea might be to make them afraid of what they love.

**Ginny**

She loves flying on a broom. It's not impossible that the Death Eaters would be aware of this. If nothing else, Voldemort could peer into her mind.

So how do you make Ginny afraid of flying? That's tough.

But you can make her afraid of falling.

Remember the mist that Harry passed through in the Maze, when he realized it was too difficult to get across? It threw him upside down and reversed his polarity,

Something similar could be done to Ginny. Tie her hands and feet together, and toss her into to the mist. Her gravity is reversed, and she's helpless to get out of it. The risk of personal injury is minute, but she can't get loose and it just feels wrong.

Or, create a pool or a circle or a something-or-other that gives the sensation of falling, falling but never landing. Tie a blindfold around her eyes, and Ginny could fall and fall and never know how close the bottom of the pit is. Broom flyers dive down and go up all the time, but remove her ability to choose how far or how fast she falls, and that could create fear. And possibly give her vertigo.

Or if you want to avoid magic entirely, just tie her ankles together and hang her upside down from something on the ceiling. Let her dangle upside down from a chandelier.

*****

What else does Ginny like? She likes animals. Ron mentions she likes cats, and she doted on Arnold the Pygmy Puff.

Something small and furry that she could pet could bring her comfort, and if you then take away that comfort, or twist it into something worse.

Ginny wakes up, and she sees Arnold lying on her. But instead of nuzzling her like he usually does, he bites down hard on her nose. The injury is superficial (how hard can a fuzzy ball barely bigger than a hamster bite?), but it hurts her heart as well as her nose.

Or, when Ginny is given a tiny bit of meat to eat, she finds purple Pygmy Puff fur in it. She just ate her pet.

****

Or maybe something a bit simpler. You mentioned that most of the known curses are something you want to avoid. Why not go for more Muggle tactics?

Take Ginny's most defining Weasley characteristic. Her long, red hair.

If Ginny is pinned to the wall or otherwise tied up in a way that she can't move away, a Death Eater with a knife could seize fistfuls of her hair and cut it off. A fistful at a time, Ginny's hair is cut off, until there's almost none left. If she's barefoot and tries to move around, and she walks on her hair, it would be deeply unsettling. And now she doesn't even look like a Weasley anymore.\\

Something that could work for either of the girls is food. Not depriving it, but making it hard to eat.

If Ginny is dehydrated, and her lips are cut and bleeding, let the Death Eaters give her something to drink. Some nice, refreshing lemonade. Which would burn the cuts on her lips and sting terribly.

**Hermione**

So what's Hermione love? Books. She loves reading and learning.

Put her in a room with bad books. Books that don't just scream, but scream horrible, crass insults. Books that can bite--not just like the Monster Book of Monsters, but books that actively try to hunt. Books that chase her in the style of animals, books that bite her fingers and toes and don't let go.

Books that plunge her into nightmares. Hermione finds herself in the world of the book, and it's not a good world at all.

A book about witch burnings attacks her, and Hermione finds herself bound to a stake, as the flames close in.

A book about Acromantula, and Hermione finds herself in Borneo, as a giant spider pierces her with its pinchers.

****

What else does Hermione love? Well, she loves her cat Crookshanks.

If we further the education angle, Hermione loves the scent of fresh parchment.

Let her witness how parchment is made.

Parchment is made of sheepskin, or goatskin, or calfskin, usually. It's not just fancy paper.

So what if there was something Hermione loves, and it's turned into parchment?

Let her see Crookshanks get made into parchment.

****\\
If Ginny's most defining physical feature is her Weasley hair (and in fairness, the same Haircut from Hell could work on Hermione), I'd argue that Hermione's feature is her teeth.

Give Hermione a piece of bread to eat. Only when she takes a bite, it turns out it's a stone. She breaks her teeth on the stone. It hurts terribly and it's humiliating and every time she closes her mouth she winds up tearing her lips.

****

That's all I can think of right now...

I think I'm going to go hug my kitty.
