A lot of good examples here already, but here's my crack at it.

Psychological torture is great! Murder people spelled to look like loved ones. Start with the other prisoner, and keep them separated for a few days. Make them doubt their own senses--gaslight them. You never killed Ginny--Purebloods are above murdering one another, silly mudblood.

Let them listen, but not see, the torture. Let them imagine what's causing the screams.

Scars are always a fun lasting thing. Disfigure them horribly, then heal them. Then do it again. Leave them scarred for days on end.

A very specific one: break/cut all of Hermiones fingers, leaving her hands useless. Maybe fuck up some other joints, and tell her all she has to do is read a few pages of a book on the floor--try turning pages without fingers--within, say, ten minutes, and she'll be healed/fed/whatever. Ginny is there with her. Ginny has been told that if she helps Hermione, or tells Hermione why she can't help, Hermione will be killed.

Leave them like that until the timer runs out, or Hermione manages to actually do it.

Food/water are big things. Make them eat off the floor or out of bowls. Make them feel less than human. Feed them scraps, offal, dishwater, anything foul. Single one out for special treatment--never explain why. Foster resentment. Maybe toss this in with forcing them to curse one another, as suggested by others, but no imperio--no, just inform them, quite plainly, that if you don't find their curses satisfactory, then you'll be dolling out punishments as well.

Force Ginny to spout blood purity nonsense during "punishment" sessions. You can get a lot of psychological mileage out of betrayal, even if they know it's forced.

Another specific one: Remove Hermione's ability to read. Curse her eyesight so words blur or simply aren't there. Cure it, do it again, over and over. Vary the time frame.

At times, let them wake up in opulent conditions, being waited on. Perfect health, dressed differently, even different appearances. etc. Gaslighting. Make them afraid to sleep, never knowing if they'll wake up in hell or the weird pureblood racist heaven.

Speaking of sleep, deprive them of it. Constant noise spells, chained near animals, or just a spell to never let them sleep. Let them go insane from that. or just one. Make the other way as one falls further into mental instability from lack of sleep.

Torture one in front of another. Promise the one being tortured that if they manage not to scream, the other isn't hurt.

Creative use of minor spells. A weak cutting spell, for instance. One does nothing. But ten? Fifty? A hundred? Especially when combined with not knowing if they'll get healed, or have to wear scars for a few days.

Freezing spells=frostbite. Fire spells to burn. Hover one over a dozen candles below bare feet, or any other skin.

Good old blunt force trauma--targets for banishing spells. Death eater darts, played with rocks. or actual darts.

Nerve damage. Shaking hands. stuttering. Make it harder for them to wave wands and speak spells, cursed, or simply from accumulated trauma.

Conditioning can be interesting, and combined with any of the above. Curse Ginny to feel intense pain, or bite her tongue, if she tries to call Hermione anything but "Mudblood" or something similar. Curse Hermione with the same if she refers to Ginny as anything but "Traitor".

Condition one or both to be actively afraid of wands. Pain if they pick one up. Excruciating pain if they move it in any spell-like way.

Strip their names from them. More dehuminization, more conditioning. No "I" just "This one" or "This Mudblood" or whatever derogatory term you prefer. Maybe spell them to actually forget their name after a while of this, and "graciously" remind them of it.

...Man, I need to go read something happier.
