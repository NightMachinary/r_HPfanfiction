That would fall into the "Power Hungry" Harry category:

*Emperor*, linkffn(5904185): he wanted power before he even entered middle school, and he would do anything to realize his vision. This is the quintessential 'power hungry' Harry fic.

*Blindness*, linkffn(10937871): this super!Harry was not very power hungry, but he would do seriously nasty stuffs in pursuit of knowledge.

*A Black Comedy*, linkffn(3401052): he and Sirius together were enough to out-duel Voldemort, so I would qualify this Harry as super. Not so much after political power, but he and Sirius definitely took no **** from anyone and messed around a lot.

*Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(10677106): Harrymort was awesome, and he revered in his fame.

  I, of course, never argued against anything that made me seem more powerful.

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167): after getting over his whiny canon stage and defeating Voldemort, the establishment betrayed Harry once again. He was joined by Ron, Hermione, and the DA in his quest to overthrow the old regime, by any means necessary.
