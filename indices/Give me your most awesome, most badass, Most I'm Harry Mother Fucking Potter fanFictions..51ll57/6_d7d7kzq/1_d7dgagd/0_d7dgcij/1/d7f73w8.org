Is it so hard to read the sidebar to get the exact code? Left Bracket, your spoiler, right bracket, left parenthesis, backslash, the word "spoiler" without quotation marks, and right parenthesis. Just like this: [[/spoiler][He gets so OP he raises an army of corpses to fight a creature. The creature took dumbledore's arm.]]
