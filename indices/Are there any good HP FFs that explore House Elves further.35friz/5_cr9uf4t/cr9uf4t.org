My headcanon of House-Elves is that they are genderless. And that they reproduce by budding, where in a magically saturated environment they can grow small ones in pods/sacs on their backs. The newborn/hatched house-elves would be fully grown, yet very tiny, and would increase in size, if not power, as they age.
