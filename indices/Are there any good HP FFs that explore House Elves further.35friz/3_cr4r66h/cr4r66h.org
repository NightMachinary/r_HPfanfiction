I thought about writing a brief story about having Dobby decide to give his powers to Harry Potter at the beginning of CoS without any explanation or exposition. The story's first act would focus on Harry's discovery of the new powers in a comedy of errors. Unfortunately, it became quite clear that the story would quickly devolve into a superpowered Harry fic and that's not really my style.

In any case, thanks for posting this topic. I think the other suggestions redditors have listed sound quite interesting.
