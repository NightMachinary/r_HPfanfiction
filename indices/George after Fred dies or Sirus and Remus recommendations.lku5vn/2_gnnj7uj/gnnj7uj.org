Not just focused on George after Fred's death, but does have a large portion of the story dealing with this: The First Day by little0bird. Although George constantly calling Fred "bro" when he thinks about him greatly annoyed me, also don't love the characterization of Charlie from this story, doesn't really fit the "canon" view of Charlie in my mind.
