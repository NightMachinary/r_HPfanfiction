*For George being sad*

linkffn(The Latecomer by HalfASlug) - George speaks at Freds funeral - This really just made me bawl crying.

linkao3(The Exceptional Mr Weasley and his Approximation of Obedience by Realmero06) - Sirius leads Fred to the afterlife. Also sad (this also might be on ffn i dont remember the website)

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9636572]]) George meets Andromeda over 3 funerals. Also good and sweet I liked it. Marginally less sad and a good insight into the world.

*For Wolfstar*

I've also so much wolfstar ones that have been recced on this site too many times to count but linkao3(Text Talk by weirdo) and linkao3(Dress Up in You by MsKingBean89) are the two best ones and are muggleAUs so maybe are a bit different to the other recs you'll get. I know reading muggle versions is odd but these two are worth it =)

All the authors of what ive recced are also brilliant and their other stories are well worth looking at!
