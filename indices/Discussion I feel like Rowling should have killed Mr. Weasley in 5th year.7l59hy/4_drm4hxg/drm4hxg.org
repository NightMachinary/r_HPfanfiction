I think Rowling should've been much harder with her characters. I think I remember her saying in an interview that she hated killing off characters because she grew so attached to them. But you know - maim, cripple, scar, burn,... There are many ways to beat a character.

Killing Arthur would've been a massive shift for Ron and the entire Weasley family. Before you even go into the emotional and family-structure nit-and-grit there is the fact that he was the breadwinner. Without him the Weasleys are 100% bankrupt. But of course more important is the effect this would have on the kids, especially Ron. I think there was this rift between Harry and his two best friends where he realized "this is war", but Ron and Hermione, blissfully ignorant of the true horror of facing Voldemort, still remain very in the moment of their schooling, their love life and their teenage problems. Which is great for the reader in the original series. In canon they serve as this anchor to what teenage life should be. Broken hearts and awkward feelings and searching for belonging and your place in the world. With Arthur dead, Ron would've been brutally brought into the harsh truth of the world of civil war they live in.

Hermione would've remained as the one hurt, but relatively untouched by the war. But Hermione was always more the one to focus up on something beyond school work as per her character. Ron is the reference point. Harry is the executing character. Hermione is the solution delivery system. So with Ron in code red warmode, our reference point completely shifts towards a state of conflict one and a half books early.

I would imagine that the following storyline would be much darker and of course completely different. Just a few things I could see happening:

- Sirius doesn't die. The Battle in the Ministry either doesn't happen at all or differently. With Arthur dead the stakes of guarding the Hall are much higher.

- Draco is being actively investigated by the trio. Ron having his mind on war would probably make him more suspicious of Draco. Suddenly Malfoy being in Burke's is enemy movement, not just dark family doing dark family stuff. Hermione, being faced with both of her friends defending that suspicion caves in and helps. As a consequence Snape would have to either think of a workaround, or die.

- Maybe Ron never leaves the trio in the forest. His greatest fear won't be Harry and Hermione getting together and his jealousy wouldn't lead to him lashing out at Harry. He may lash out because of something else - maybe the lack of progress - but not because of his jealousies.
