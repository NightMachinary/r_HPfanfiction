When you do terrible things to a character, you can leave them alive. Arthur Weasley spending the better part of a year in St Mungo's, losing a limb, and suffering enough nerve damage to have trouble with wand movements, for instance. It only takes a few extra seconds to think of. It leaves another character around to have interactions with. It gives Arthur the chance for other character arcs. And it still galvanizes the Weasleys.
