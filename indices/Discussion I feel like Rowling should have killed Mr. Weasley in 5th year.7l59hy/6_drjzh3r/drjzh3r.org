I'm glad she didn't. Harry needed the Weasleys to be the happy family in his life, the thing he could look forward to. Ron provided much-needed levity. If Ron loses his dad, the whole series takes on a much darker and depressing tone. Same with Ginny. Perhaps Harry doesn't fall for her because her fun personality doesn't come through that 6th year.

Though, it would be interesting to see Harry using Arthur's death to distance himself from everyone. Seeing the Weasley family destroyed like that would cause this, in my opinion.
