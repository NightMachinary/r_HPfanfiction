Killing arthur would have allowed remus to live, and as much as i love arthur, i love remus more, and it would have been nice for him to finally have some happiness. That said- i wouldnt wish the death of a parent on any child, but yeah, ron would have had some turmoil to his character. Legit turmoil, not "my best mate is famous and i'm his sidekick" turmoil. I dont know if it would have made him a more sympatheric character, or if it would have sent him off the deep end, though.
