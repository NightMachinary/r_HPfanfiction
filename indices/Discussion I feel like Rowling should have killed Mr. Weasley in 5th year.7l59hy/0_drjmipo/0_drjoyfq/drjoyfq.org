Why exactly do you love Lupin? I mean, he failed Harry, he avoided contact and he did nothing to help Harry. Even Sirius showed up in Hogwarts during the tournament and he faced summary execution. The Patronus lessons with the boggart were shite because Lupin knew that Harry could not perform the spell and yet he released the fake dementor. And he was a dick to Tonks, followed by being a shitty husband and running away. Any marriage vow includes "in good and in bad times". That is not something that you shrug off, that kind of behaviour destroys trust and take years to heal.

I mean, I get it, Lupin had a shitty childhood but almost everyone besides the Weasleys has a tragic backstory.
