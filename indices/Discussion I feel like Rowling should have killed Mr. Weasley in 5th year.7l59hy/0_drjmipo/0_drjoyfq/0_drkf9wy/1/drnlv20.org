Honestly, I think part of the reason I love Lupin is that he was a.) At least kind of competent, and b.) The only one of the Marauders whose failures are due to inaction rather than action.

Lupin was the only one from that group that wasn't at least at one point a huge asshole. And he was also the only one who actually cared all that much about random students, etc. Snape, Lockhart, Slughorn... they all kind of let their bullshit get in the way of being a good professor. Lupin didn't. He tried to move past the bullshit of their youth, and I think he was pretty successful.

He's not a great heroic protagonist type, sure (though I do love when he's a protagonist), but... he is the kind of person I would want as a friend and as a teacher. I love Sirius, but if he were real I would probably avoid him because he may well have a neon sign saying "we will have fun but after that /you will be in trouble/". He's the kind of person whose life story it is probably better to hear than participate in (at least for me). Pettigrew is an asshole, James was basically another Sirius until the last year of Hogwarts, and by then when he was more "adult" and mature... he still never sought to atone for being a huge bully for years.
