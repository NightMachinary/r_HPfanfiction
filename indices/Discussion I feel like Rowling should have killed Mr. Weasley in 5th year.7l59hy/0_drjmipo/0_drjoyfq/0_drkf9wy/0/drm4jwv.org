This is a good point about Lupin. He has no self-esteem, is most likely depressed, and yet he still tries to protect others. He's not particularly effective, but he tries so hard and has so much more to overcome than other characters.

I genuinely adore Lupin. He has his faults, but I think anyone facing his difficulties would show much worse ones.
