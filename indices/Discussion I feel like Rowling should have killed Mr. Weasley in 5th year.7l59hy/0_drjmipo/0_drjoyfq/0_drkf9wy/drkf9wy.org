Mrs. Weasley kinda has one, her two brothers...

There's a lot of Lupin hate out there, but I think he really strikes a chord with people suffering from anxiety and depression. He's standoffish with everyone because he doesn't truly believe that anyone can actually like him or want him around. He literally sees himself as making everyone's life worse just by existing. He's not exactly a resilient soul, and he doesn't reach out, but he has his good qualities if you get to know him.
