Marriage might be a crappy deal IMHO, but if you do get married then you better keep your end of the bargain!

Also: If your best friend dies then you should have the common decency to look after his kid a bit (if you can't get custody or don't want to then you should at least periodically check up on the kid!)

So yeah, I agree with you in Lupin! I liked him at first, but once I started thinking that quickly stopped and that was before he turned out to be a damned coward!

Lupin is too used to run from his problems. He's quite the shitty Gryffindor, because he isn't very brave (IMHO he, like Hermione, should have sorted into Ravenclaw!) - only Peter Pettigrew is worse!
