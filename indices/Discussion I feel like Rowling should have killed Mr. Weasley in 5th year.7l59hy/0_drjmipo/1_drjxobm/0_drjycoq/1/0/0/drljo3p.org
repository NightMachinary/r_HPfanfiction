no, Ron taught Harry the value of family, love, the most powerful magic of all. Plus it would be weird if he started dating his ex best friends dead sister. Ron should have died somewhere in book 7 if at all. And if you are going that route then I suppose you have Harry and Ginny relationship fall apart and him ending up with Hermione as Jk wanted but eh I like it how it is.
