Na, she should have had Bella kill Molly :) (A housewife killing a trained fucking terrorist in a fight is unrealistic as fuck - even more in a world of magic where the most powerful magic users can fight dozens of enemies at a time without getting a scratch and where you need another powerful magic user to even have a chance at taking them down!)

As for Arthur? Yeah, maybe (then the Weasley parents would both be dead and Ron and Ginny would have to grow up fast, would have been better from a storytelling POV...Ron would have finally get a taste of being Harry Potter, something that he craved, despite the fact that he was basically saying that somebody should kill his parents and give him a vault full of money instead!)

I would have loved it if Nymphadora Tonks survived instead (Don't like Lupin much, but Tonks should have lived - for Teddy!)
