It raises an interesting question I've never thought of before. How would she have killed Arthur? If it's the same as the book but Nagini's venom acts faster or they don't find him in time, was she planning to leave it with Harry witnessing it through Nagini? He was traumatised enough just thinking he'd hurt him, imagine what he would've been like if he felt responsible for his death!
