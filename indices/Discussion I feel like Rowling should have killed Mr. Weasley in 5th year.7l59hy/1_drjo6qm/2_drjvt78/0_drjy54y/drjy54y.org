call me naive, but i think, Rowling decided on herself, when the right time for her Book delivery would be. Its finished, when its finished. There was this news that G.R.R. Martin havent made it to the Deadline for his new Book of the Song of Ice and Fire. I say: dont push the Authors or Errors will be in the Work. Its done when its done.

The releases for games are also delayed, but unlike them, you cant publish a "reworked" version for Books later (hey people, here you have the first 500 Pages, the next hundred are on its way)
