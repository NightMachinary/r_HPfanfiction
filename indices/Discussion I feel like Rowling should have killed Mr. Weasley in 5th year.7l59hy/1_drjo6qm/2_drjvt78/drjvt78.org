Arthur's death would radicalize Weasleys and make Ginny an integral part of their group. The Trio would become a Quarter story and that meant a lot more work for JKR (she only needs to worry about 4 interpersonal relationships in a trio, but has to deal with 11 in a quartet). With OOTP and DH already longer than 800 pages and delivery schedule tight, she simply chose the easier way out.
