I agree. But the Battle of Hogwarts would have been a turkey shoot if Harry and Hermione had thought it through. They were defending an fortified position on advantageous terrain. The mandrakes are probably deadlier than mortar fire and can, on their own, completely stop an assault. They had hundreds of melee droids capable of slaughtering their enemies with complete disregard for their safety. A conscript could have directed the battle and won without even finishing basic training.

Then again, Voldemort's leadership skills are just as bad.
