Indeed, forget about Hogwarts - how about some other school under an alias, with some makeup for that scar it's doable! - but even if I were crazy brave like Harry:

I'd learn as much as possible, hell I'd have raided the Black-Library ASAP ("Sirius, Voldemort wants me dead and I need to fight back! A stunner or a reductor curse won't do the trick! Please let me check out your family library, there might be things in there that can help - especially since nobody will expect me to use them!") to learn some of the stuff Voldemort and the DEs know! Fight fire with fire and all that :)
