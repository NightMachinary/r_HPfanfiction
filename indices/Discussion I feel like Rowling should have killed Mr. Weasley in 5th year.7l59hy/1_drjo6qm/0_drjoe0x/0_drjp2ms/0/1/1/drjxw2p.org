there is the Thing that, in each Book something new about the Magical World is explained to Harry/the Reader. The Floo thing wasnt explained in Book 1, despite the fact, that the Pupils would surely talk about this during a Year. But as an Author you want to avoid confusing or "flooding" the (Child) Reader with so much information right at the Beginning. And as we learn in Book 5, The Twins are developing Items on their own, completely new in the Magical world.
