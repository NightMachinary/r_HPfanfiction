  There's also the fact that Harry had to be ignorant so that other characters could explain things to him, which in turn explained things to the reader.

The easy and better way to handle that would be to have Harry/Hermione explain it TO someone who isn't the POV character. That way readers still get the info, but the hero/pov/protagonist doesn't need to be incompetent.\\
Yeah, not really doable with the cannon trio, either Ron or Hermione would need to be changed/replaced, but that'd be a small price to pay for not making the protagonist a dumbass.\\
Obviously the one being explained to would need to be a muggleborn/raised. Not because muggleborns are less intelligent, but because the readers need explanations to things that even Crabb and Goyle would already know from their childhood.

The character being explained wouldn't even have to be that important plot wise, just a tag along that the others are fond of enough that they don't mind explaining things. Personally I think Ron could have taken the role quite well if he wasn't wizard born. I'd probably swap out Ron/Hermione, with a competent!Harry and wizardborn!Hermione explaining things to muggleborn!Ron.\\
Hermione doesn't need to become obsolete, she still has a lot of background and culture that the other two don't, she's smart, etc. There's a lot of ways to be smart that DON'T focus on "How do I kill that guy?".
