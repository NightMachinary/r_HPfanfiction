I think that was more jkr's writing more than anything. Harry was the pov character so he couldn't be too competent otherwise characters like Hermione would have become obsolete. There's also the fact that Harry had to be ignorant so that other characters could explain things to him, which in turn explained things to the reader. Honestly the one thing I didn't like about the Harry Potter books was that jkr made her main and supporting characters incompetent when she wanted to create conflict, rather than making the villains a bit more competent so the protagonists don't have to be written OOC.
