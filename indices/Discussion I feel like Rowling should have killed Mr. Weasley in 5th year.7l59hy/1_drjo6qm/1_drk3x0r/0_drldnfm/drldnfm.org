Tell Dumbledore where to stuff his "Riddle-Theory" (sorry, but what Dumbledore told Harry could have been done in one evening!), drop Quidditch (if you don't want to actually go pro, then why are you on the house-team? You can play pickup-games without that, if it's only the sport you love!) and just drop Malfoy and his goons (Ambush!) and use Veritaserum on him!

There, a lot of free time to use for studying stuff not exactly on the curriculum!
