I could see Ginny having used a sort of 'opposite' Love Potion - something she takes to make herself seem more attractive, with the aim of convincing Harry to notice her. She'd get annoyed that he doesn't seem to be affected by it/the attention of so many other boys, that she could have settled on Michael/Dean when it seemed it wasn't going to work.
