The theme of HBP more than of the other books was love and also how it can be twisted with love potions. That's why Hermione and Ron drama occurs. And that's why Harry relises his attraction to Ginny in that book-it wasn't an accident that these two plot occur but not because Ginny was love potioning Harry. Further he starts to like her early on in the book after spending the summer with her well before the love potion introduction. And we already have the guilty culprit that was trying to love potion Harry in Romilda Vane.

Also it's never stated that Molly used a love potion on anyone. She only /brewed/ a love potion, which is mentioned in Prisoner of Azkaban, and whether the intended target was Arthur is never stated.
