  combined with Molly's story about "encouraging" Arthur with Love Potion,

There is no such story. Whatever story Molly was telling Ginny and Hermione must have been much more benign, she would hardly be telling it in public otherwise, nor would there be such a reaction to the story.

  and the Love Potion story about Merope and Tom Riddle,
#+end_quote

Which shows that Tom Riddle Sr. infatuation with Merope was completely different from Harry's attraction to Ginny.

  and the Love Potions in the chocolates from Romilda...
#+end_quote

Which again shows something completely different from Harry's attraction to Ginny.

#+begin_quote
  I find it highly likely that Ginny was supposed to be using potions on Harry... just to get his attention... but that an editor somewhere told JKR that it seemed "more than a little bit Rapey"

This thread is not about preposterous fanon theories, but about what Rowling might have intended to have done. Unless you're suggesting that the author is a complete idiot (which is not really supported by the rest of the books) there is no conceivable way where she would have Harry fall for Ginny in the way that led to Voldemort's conception.

Frankly, if Rowling was more cynical, it might be a reasonable idea to think that all these mentions of love potions were to make sure that no one would imagine that the relationship between Harry and Ginny was started by a love potion, and yet this is exactly what is used an argument to support the inane love potion theory...
