Snape's backstory is already planned from the start. He's supposed to be a character that did a lot of bad things, but still doing a right thing in the end even if he's doing it for the wrong reason. JKR still called Snape a vindictive and a bully in [[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/670176159561326592?lang=en][her tweet]]. She only changed her mind in CC, although I believe that she doesn't really do a lot in its development and doesn't really care about the franchise anymore.

I agree on Ron and Hermione. The later books also doesn't show the Weasley as a poor but kind working class as good as the early books. I believe it's influenced by her growth from a starving writer to a billionare.
