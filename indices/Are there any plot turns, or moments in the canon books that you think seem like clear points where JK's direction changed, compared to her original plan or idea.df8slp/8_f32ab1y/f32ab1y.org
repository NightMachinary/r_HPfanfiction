It was on this forum that I have been reminded that the last books were actually influenced by first movies, so that weird changing of Snape from dark abusive and completely negative character of PoA and CoS to suave Alan Rickmanish deep persona was actually written by JKR. The same goes for the movie!Ron and super!Hermione of the later JKR books.
