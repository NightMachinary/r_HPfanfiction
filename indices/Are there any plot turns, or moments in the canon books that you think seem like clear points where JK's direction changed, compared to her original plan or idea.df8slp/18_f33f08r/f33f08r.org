The moment in the Malfoy Manor when wormtail never was bound by harry's debt of saving his life but off handedly choked himself in the dungeons. It was like that scene was thrown in just for the sake of the debt being paid. There was no need for it.

Like when Voldemort was unable to kill harry it made sense if you dig it but Peter's sacrifice didn't felt like it. It felt like it was thrown in only because Jk doesn't had anywhere else to put it.
