  Reading through fics that go big on canon rehashing, I notice whenever the authors use lines from the movies, that were never in the books. The carving "mudblood" on Hermione's arm scene in Malfoy Manor was never in the books.

Yet they claim to have read all the books ðŸ˜’, and that the fic is based off the books.
