That one is often a personal artistic choice and have seen it used really well (it's not because the author doesn't know canon necessarily). Hermione has a small scar in the books on her neck that represents the same idea of having a lasting physical consequence of the prejudice, whilst in the movies the mudblood carving on her arm is obviously much more potent example.
