  "Years ago, I knew a boy, who made all the wrong choices", Dumbledore's line talking to Draco in the Astronomy Tower. Not in the books. "Draco, Draco, you are not a killer," is Dumbledore's most sympathetic line in the book version of the scene.

This was one brilliant line, simply because even though the first guess, about that boy, would be Tom Riddle, it isn't certain. It could be Gellert Grindelwald who was also someone who met Dumbledore years ago, and made a lot of wrong choices. Or it could even mean Dumbledore himself, he despised himself for ignoring his own family in favour of glory, he could even be referring to himself in such a way due to self-hatred
