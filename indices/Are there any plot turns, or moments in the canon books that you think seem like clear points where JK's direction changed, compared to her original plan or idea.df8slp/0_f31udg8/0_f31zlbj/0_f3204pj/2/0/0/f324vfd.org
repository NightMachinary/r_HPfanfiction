The "mudblood scar" thing is not an inherently bad trope when I see it in fanfic, it's just a signifier than the author is bringing movie-canon or fanon into their fic. It's similar to Lucius Malfoy's long blond hair and snake walking stick. Lucius in the books was described to have Draco's blond hair and pale, pointy features, but the rest was made up for the movies.

Other movie-only lines are... more questionable when I see them in fanfiction, because it changes entire characterizations.

- "Years ago, I knew a boy, who made all the wrong choices", Dumbledore's line talking to Draco in the Astronomy Tower. Not in the books. "Draco, Draco, you are not a killer," is Dumbledore's most sympathetic line in the book version of the scene.

- "I make bad things happen to people who are mean to me," orphan Riddle from the Pensieve. Changed from the books, and changes the whole character. The book-canon line is "I make bad things happen to people who */annoy me./*"
