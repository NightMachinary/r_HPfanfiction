It's not contradictory per se, but Fred and George were meant to be of Charlie's build who's described as stout and short (hence they are beaters). In Deathly Hallows they are taller than Harry who is of a height with his tall father. So Fred and George are now tall /and/ stout. I suspect that JK Rowling was probably influenced by the heights of the twins in the movies with that one, or the height of Harry.
