I think I feel like compounded into this is the movies starting while the books were still unfinished, leading to JK compounding some character bits in her writing and picking up influences from her own adaptation.

E.g. I'm pretty sure Jason Isaacs originated Lucius Malfoy's long hair which then came to appear in later books. Were her later book characters influenced in other ways? Stands to reason that possibly.
