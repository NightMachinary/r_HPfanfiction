The problem with Hermione was half JKR, but the other half - and I think this is the true origin of Fanon Hermione - was Steve Kloves, the screenwriter for the movies. He was the one who lowkey shipped Harry/Hermione from the beginning, and took Ron's line from PoA ("If you want to get Harry, you'll have to kill me first") and gave them to Hermione. He also started making Ron goofy from PS (/falls through Devil's Snare/ "Lucky we didn't panic!" instead of "Are you a witch or not!?").

Rowling made Hermione flawed and insufferable, even though Hermione is never truly punished or called out for her darker deeds. But Kloves was the one who took out the flaws altogether.

Reading through fics that go big on canon rehashing, I notice whenever the authors use lines from the movies, that were never in the books. The carving "mudblood" on Hermione's arm scene in Malfoy Manor was never in the books.
