For me it has always been Ron's narrative function. In the first book he operates as the native. He's at home in the magical world. He can recite strange factoids from memory, *HP:PS CH:14*

  ‘But it's against our laws,' said Ron. ‘Dragon-breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that.

and his hobbies and interests are given screen time and fold into the final challenge (chess scene). Additionally his actions drive a lot of the plot in regards to Malfoy and Hermione. He is also the vector through which we experience family life.

He works in the first book as an inverse to Harry, their lives being almost complete opposites.

His role is canablised by both Harry and Hermione as they turn native. For me this is best encapsulated here: *HP:DH CH:7*

  ‘I don't think there's anything hidden in the icing,' said Scrimgeour, ‘but a Snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object. You know why, I'm sure?'

  Harry shrugged. Hermione, however, answered: Harry thought that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could not suppress the urge. ‘Because Snitches have flesh memories,' she said.

  ‘What?' said Harry and Ron together; both considered Hermione's Quidditch knowledge negligible.

That should have been Ron's moment. But by this point Ron's transformation is complete. Whatever he was in book 1 is gone to be replaced by some strange sockpuppet for JK Rowling, which I think is evidenced by this quote:

  I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment. That's how it was conceived, really. For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron. I know, I'm sorry, I can hear the rage and fury it might cause some fans, but if I'm absolutely honest, distance has given me perspective on that. It was a choice I made for very personal reasons, not for reasons of credibility.
