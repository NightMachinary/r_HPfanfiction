I am most grateful to this sub for snapping me out of my teenage Dramione fueled anti-Ron mindset. I read so many fics that bashed Ron (and remembered his poor treatment in later canon) that I forgot how awesome the character can be. I'm still iffy on the canon ending of Ron & Hermione, but I love the character again.
