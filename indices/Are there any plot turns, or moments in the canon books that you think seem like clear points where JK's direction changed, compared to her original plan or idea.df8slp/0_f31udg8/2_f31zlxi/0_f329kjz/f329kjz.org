Between the later books and the movies' portrayal of Ron, bashing his character is almost expected. It's hard to hate Harry, because we see the world through his eyes and he's a snarky bastard a lot of the time. His flaws can be easily overlooked because we see things from his perspective and understand his reasoning. Hermione's basically a Mary Sue, she's almost always right and gets a lot of positive moments throughout the series. She's too trusting in authority, until she isn't, and when she decides to break the rules it's generally overboard and she's never called out on going too far. Ron's the most flawed of the three, and makes some of the biggest mistakes (abandoning Harry in fourth year and on the Hunt, for example). His strengths are quickly forgotten towards the end of the series, and while he's loyal in the end, his laziness and mistakes stand out compared to Harry and Hermione's flaws. So it's not a leap in logic to think that they would be better off without him.

All three of them could have been written so much better. Harry's "power level" is inconsistent as fuck and there are times where he's either too passive or too active. He's able to do a post-NEWT charm most adults can't perform at 13, but when it comes to fighting Voldemort all he remembers is a spell he learned at 12. He learns spells past his year during the Tri-Wizard Tournament, teaches students a variety of advanced Defense magic, and is able to perform a couple of Unforgiveables during the later books, but he's mostly relying on luck during his actual fights. He also has so much motivation to do better and learn as much as he can in order to survive, but he doesn't really seem motivated beyond doing enough to get by.

Hermione should be called out for some of the shit she does, and either learn from it or just accept that she's a sociopath and embrace that. She does some downright nasty stuff and honestly I don't mind that. I like the theory that she is either a sociopath or psychopath and that's why she so rigidly follows the rules, but when she decides to break them she goes completely overboard, knocking out students, stealing fron professors, and making people sogn a cursed contract without telling them. My main problem is that it's just accepted as her being morally right, when either she should be condemned for it and learn to grow and be more empathetic, or she should embrace her ruthlessness and learn to control it better, using it against more dangerous people.

For Ron, his love of chess and Quiddich could have easily been transferred into a love of strategy as a whole. Make History of Magic a legitimate class instead of a borong joke class, have them go into detail on historical battles and politics and the strategies implemented during those events, and make it Ron's best class because he has an interest in the strategy of war. Keep him as the exposition on wizarding culture and law rather than just handing that role over to Hermione (unless, say, they're researching a law he's unfamiliar with and she finds it), and use his want to not be outshined by his brothers and Harry to motivate him more. He can start off by just doing the bare minimum in his classes, but give him a turning point where he realizes going on adventures with Harry and the war with Voldemort is serious shit and he needs to buckle up. Really the entire fourth year abandonment was pretty shitty, either make it work better and don't rehash it during the Hunt, or give him another way to have him and Harry get into a fight and make up later. Have both him and Harry learn and grow from it, and have that solidify their brotherly loyalty towards one another, so they always have each other's backs after that. I wouldn't have minded it so much if he didn't do the same thing later on in the series. I understand it was a stressful time and he was being influenced by the Horcrux, and that people can make the same mistake over and over again, but at the same time it seemed contrived (why the hell were they wearing the damn thing when Hermione has a bottomless bag and Harry had a bag that could only be opened by himself?) and it made him seemed so much weaker willed than Harry and Hermione, once again accentuating his flaws while minimizing their's.

TL;DR JKR is sometimes shite and could have done better.
