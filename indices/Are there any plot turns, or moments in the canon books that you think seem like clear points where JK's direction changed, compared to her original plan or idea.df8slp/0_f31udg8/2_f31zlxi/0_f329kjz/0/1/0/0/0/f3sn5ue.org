Empathy is definitely viewed to involve not only understanding other's emotions but also to share those feelings and emotions and act. Hermione understands how other's might feel about certain things, but fails to consider an appropriate response.

And I wouldn't say Hermione is per se autistic, but with her it is a /lot/ like the difference between autism and sociopathy. Someone on the autism spectrum is often empathetic but can come across as very insensitive. It's not because they don't care, they struggle to communicate in the appropriate social way. Whilst a sociopath may understand what they did was hurtful but just not care at all.
