So there are 3 types of empathy

Cognitive empathy which lets you put yourself in someone elses shoes understand what they are thinking and feeling.

Emotional Empathy: Feeling what the other person is feeling. A kid sees another kid crying and starts crying.

Compassionate empathy: you are moved to help out of empathy. Someone feels sad so you give them a hug.

Id say Hermione is more sympathetic than empathetic. But to be very specific I think she might struggle with cognitive empathy at times even if she has the other 2 types.

Shes also very righteous and stubborn so it is also hieghtened due to this giving her maybe tunnel vision when she sets her sights on a goal.

I am not entirely sure if thats an autistic thing though so dont quote me on that

However I do know the whole sociopath and psycopath has been dropped as it was used as blanket terms for personality disorders and had negative connotations. But I dont think Hermione really has them. Though I do think if I had to pick she would show some symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Personality disorder

People with OCPD have the following characteristics:

They find it hard to express their feelings.

They have difficulty forming and maintaining close relationships with others.

They're hardworking, but their obsession with perfection can make them inefficient.

They often feel righteous, indignant, and angry.

They often face social isolation.

They can experience anxiety that occurs with depression.

Again this is more taken to an extreme I dont think anything Hermione has in common with this is extreme enough to consider her being ocpd in canon. But just a interesting tidbit.
