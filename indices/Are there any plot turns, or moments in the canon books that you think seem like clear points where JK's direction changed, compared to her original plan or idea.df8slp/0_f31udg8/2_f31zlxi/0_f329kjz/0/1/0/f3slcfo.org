Hermione to me reminds me of myself. I genuinely care about other people but absolutely do struggle to communicate.

So Hermione sometimes does things she thinks are helping but actually aren't-it's her flaw. That's the important difference. She's not lacking in empathy itself, only the ability on occasion to properly communicate that empathy.
