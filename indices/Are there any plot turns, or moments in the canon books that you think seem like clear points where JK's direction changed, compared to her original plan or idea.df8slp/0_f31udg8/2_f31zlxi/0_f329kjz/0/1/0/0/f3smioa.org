I mean personally I think Hermione is a very sympathetic person she recognizes when they are suffering and she cares and wants to help the best way she knows how. But i think she is bad at realizing how other people may feel at the moment focusing more on solving a problem than being acknowledging or accomadating of feelings.

This doesnt make her a cold or or bad person mind you.

Empathy doesnt mean that you are a good person.

Case in point Tom Riddle as a kid is very empathetic. He understands how people are feeling in general, about others, about him etc. Its what made him good at being minipulative. Like how he was aware of a old ladys crush on him and used it to get the Hufflepuff cup.

How he got all teachers but Dumbledore to love him.

How he got Hagrid to believe that Aragog had killed Myrtle etc

Hes not sympathetic or kind though.
