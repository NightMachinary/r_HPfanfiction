Hermione is an emotional person but also bad at emotions. Handling her own and handling those of others.

She doesnt understand why going to Mcgonnigal instead of talking to Ron and Harry about the fireboldt first could be damaging in a friendship. Her logic about the fireboldt was sound the idea she should consider their emotions doesnt occur

She doesnt understand why Ron is so mad about Scabbers he complained so much about the rat. Cats eat rats she cant controll that.

She doesnt understand why lecturing Lavender on how wrong Trawleny is, when Lavender is upset over her rabbit dying could be insensitive.

She doesn't understand that house elves who see being freed as bad would need their outlook changed before being freed and that attempts to trick them into that before changing their outlook could backfire.

She cares too much to be a ice queen but empathy is not her strong suit.
