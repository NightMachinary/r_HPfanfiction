Hermione is absolutely not a sociopath/psychopath-couldn't be further from it in fact, we see how much she empathises with others (Harry, Neville, Ginny, Xenophilius) and a sociopath/psychopath is fundamentally incapable of that level of empathy.

One of my biggest problems with fanon in fact is its tendency to potray Hermione as this cold and purely logical figure, when book Hermione is not. She's emotional and impulsive, and truly kindhearted and caring. Her controversial actions come out of passion and emotion-to her the worst sin (and by extension JK Rowling) is betrayel, and that's why she seemed so extreme in her measures against betrayel of Dumbledore's Army and Ron's emotional betrayels.
