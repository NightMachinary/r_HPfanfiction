To be fair, it was made clear from the beginning that Ginny's shy, retiring attitude was 100% because of Harry. Ron, Fred, and George all remark on it, and the one conversation Ginny has in the first three books that she doesn't know Harry can hear her for is her being pushy with her mom... to go and see Harry Potter.

It sucks that her character development was 'offscreen,' but when the 'camera' was the one making her nervous and quiet, that's pretty much the only way it could happen. The ultimate trigger for her rising back to relevance - Harry forgetting that Ginny was also possessed by Voldemort - is actually pretty well done, since Harry was cheapening Ginny's own hero complex regarding himself, so of course said hero complex would prompt her to lash out at the thing demeaning it... even if that was Harry himself.
