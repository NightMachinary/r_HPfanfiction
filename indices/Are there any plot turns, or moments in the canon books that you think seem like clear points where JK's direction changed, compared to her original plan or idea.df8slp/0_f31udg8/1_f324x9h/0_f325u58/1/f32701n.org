A lot of it is tell, but Ginny is legitimately shown as a good and supportive friend to Harry in Book 5--getting him out of his "possession" funk, help him talk to Sirius through the Floo, etc. The problem is that her screen time is squeezed by all the other stuff going on in that book, and then she's unnecessarily shipped off with Dean for another year instead of letting their relationship actually /develop/.
