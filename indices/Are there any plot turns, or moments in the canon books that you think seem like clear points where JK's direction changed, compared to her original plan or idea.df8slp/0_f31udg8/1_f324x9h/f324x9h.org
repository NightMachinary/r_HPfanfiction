I'd argue Neville is a similar case, except that JKR eventually brought him back /on/ track. He's a fairly important character in Book 1 with some significant development. Then, in Books 2-4, he falls to the wayside and is mostly the butt of jokes like he was in the beginning--until he comes back and becomes a serious fighter in Book 5.
