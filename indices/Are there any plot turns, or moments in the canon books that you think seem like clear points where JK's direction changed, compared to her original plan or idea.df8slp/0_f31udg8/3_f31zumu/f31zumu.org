The disgusting thing is this wacko-world version of Ron is carried over into Cursed Child, and the creators (including JKR) insist that, yes, this is canon and everyone is in character.

.

Exhibit 1: Ron is an idiot.

*ACT III, SCENE VI*

#+begin_quote
  *RON:* Snape, a royal visit, and --- (he sees SCORPIUS and is immediately alarmed) what's he doing here?

  *He fumbles out his wand.*

  *RON:* I'm armed and --- entirely dangerous and seriously advise you ---

  *He realizes his wand is the wrong way around and turns it right.*

.

Exhibit 2: Everyone treats Ron like an idiot.

*ACT I, SCENE VII*

    *HARRY:* Hi. Just delivering a pre-Hogwarts gift --- gifts --- Ron's sent this . . .

    *ALBUS:* Okay. A love potion. Okay.

    *HARRY:* I think it's a joke about --- I don't know what. Lily got farting gnomes, James got a comb that's made his hair turn a shade of pink. Ron --- well, Ron's Ron, you know?

Exhibit 3: Ron is not only an idiot, he's also an alcoholic.

*ACT III, SCENE XVII*

#+begin_quote
  *HERMIONE:* Ron, whatever this is, I've got ten minutes until the goblins show up to talk security at Gringotts ---

  *RON:* I mean, we've been together so long --- and married for so long --- I mean, so long ---

  *HERMIONE:* If this is your way of saying you want a marital break, Ron, then, to be clear, I will skewer you with this quill.

  *RON:* Shut up. Will you shut up for once? I want to do one of those marriage renewal things I've read about. Marriage renewal. What do you think?

  *HERMIONE (melting):* You want to marry me again?

  *RON:* Well, we were only young when we did it the first time and I got very drunk and --- well, to be honest, I can't remember much of it and . . . The truth is --- I bloody love you, Hermione Granger, and whatever time says --- *I'd like the opportunity to say so in front of lots of other people. Again. Sober.*
