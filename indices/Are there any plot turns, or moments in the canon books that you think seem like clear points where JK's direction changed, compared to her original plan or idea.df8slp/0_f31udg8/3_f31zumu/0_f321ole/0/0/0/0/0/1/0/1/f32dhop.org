The evidence that Petunia still loved Lily is that she keeps Harry (she certainly never loved him). That was an important point in the books.

That she would therefore not be able to quite get rid of an object of Lily's she had access to-and it's certainly implied that it might be the only memento she had of Lily's at all in Cursed Child-shouldn't be surprising when she couldn't quite get rid of Harry either. And like Harry the blanket was hidden out of site.
