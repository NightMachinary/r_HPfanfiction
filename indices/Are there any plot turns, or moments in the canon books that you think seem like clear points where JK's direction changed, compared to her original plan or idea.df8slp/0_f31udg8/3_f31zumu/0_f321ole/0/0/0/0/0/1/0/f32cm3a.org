  Ahh, but one important thing we know about Petunia is she does love her sister.

This is never shown in canon.

The main proof I've seen used is the line /“You didn't just lose a mother that night in Godric's Hollow, you know. I lost a sister”/ from a deleted scene in the DH movie. It never appeared in the books, and Petunia never shows her love of Lily. Right up until the end, the Dursleys are petty and hateful to Harry and "his lot".

  Finally Uncle Vernon blurted out, "But what about my work? What about Dudley's school? I don't suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards---"

  "Well, I don't believe it," repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in front of Harry again. "I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe it's a plot to get the house."

  "Ready, Diddy?" asked Aunt Petunia, fussily checking the clasp of her handbag so as to avoid looking at Harry altogether.

  "Why isn't he coming with us?"

  Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia froze where they stood, staring at Dudley as though he had just expressed a desire to become a ballerina.

It's /Dudley/ who shows that he really does care about Harry, not Petunia or Vernon. Petunia and Vernon had no problem with leaving Harry on his own in their last appearance in DH.

Even if you could say that Petunia loved Lily when they were children, Petunia never loved /Harry/. She mistreated, abused, and neglected him for his entire childhood. She was ready to toss him out when the Dementors almost got her little Diddykins. If Petunia ever /could/ show love to the magical side of her family, the in-character version would be through keeping a childhood memento of Lily, like family photos or something Muggle that Lily owned. Not /Harry's/ baby blanket, which represented the day Harry and the wizarding world forcefully intruded themselves on her family.
