I considered the blanket as one of the few plot points that made sense oddly. Because it's such a Harry thing, to impart what he considers to be an important meaningful gift that would mend the bond-Harry is very much a sentimental character.

Whilst his son views it as another way of emphasising how little his father actually understands him.
