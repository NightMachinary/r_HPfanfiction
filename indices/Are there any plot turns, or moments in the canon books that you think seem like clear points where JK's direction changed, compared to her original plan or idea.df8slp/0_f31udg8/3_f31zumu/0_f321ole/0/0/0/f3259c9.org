I could too, but as an adult, Harry would have Ginny on his side when communicating with his kids.

The problem with Cursed Child's portrayal of Harry's parenting issues is how the writers unrealistically cranked up the drama over a ridiculous issue. Namely that Harry gave Albus a present that Albus didn't want, and that present was the baby blanket that Harry had been wrapped in when left on the doorstep by Dumbledore. Aunt Petunia had saved it for all these years (why???) and Dudley passed it on when she died. Meanwhile, James Sirius gets Harry's Invisibility Cloak.

  *HARRY:* I think --- believe --- Petunia wanted me to have it, that's why she kept it, and now I want you to have it from me. I didn't really know my mother --- but I think she'd have wanted you to have it too. And maybe --- I could come find you --- and it --- on Hallows' Eve. I'd like to be with it on the night they died --- and that could be good for the two of us . . .

It's so stupid and forced.
