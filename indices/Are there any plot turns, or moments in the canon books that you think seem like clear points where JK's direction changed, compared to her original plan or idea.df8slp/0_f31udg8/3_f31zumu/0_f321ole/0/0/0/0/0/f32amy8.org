It's an interesting idea in concept, but like most things in Cursed Child, it was poorly thought out and doesn't make sense when you think about it. And this ruins any enjoyment I could have had with the story. Because why on Earth would Petunia keep the blanket safe and in good condition for 40 years? The core of her character is embracing her normal muggle life, being as normal as possible, and dissociating herself from any connection to the abnormal and unnatural.

  "Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be."

Another example of poorly thought-out ideas was Alternate Universe Cedric. Exciting and unexpected as a plot element, but it's an inherent contradiction to the core of who Cedric is supposed to be. Thinking about this plot point makes it look like the writers didn't understand time travel, alternate universes, Cedric's character, or all of the above. This is a running issue with the plotting of the play - that things happened because the writers wanted it to happen, because they thought it was cool or interesting. Making sense was optional.

*ACT III, SCENE V*

  *SCORPIUS:* He wasn't supposed to do it alone. Cedric was supposed to win it with him. But we humiliated him out of the tournament. And as a result of that humiliation he became a Death Eater. I can't work out what he did in the Battle of Hogwarts --- whether he killed someone or --- but he did something and it changed everything.

  *SNAPE:* Cedric Diggory killed only one wizard and not a significant one --- Neville Longbottom.

  *SCORPIUS:* Humiliating Cedric turned him into a very angry young man, and then he became a Death Eater and --- and --- it all went wrong. Really wrong.
