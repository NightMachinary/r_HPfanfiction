CC suffers the same problem as (almost) every sequel/prequel exsisted, it can't decide if it would still follow the original works or start a new one. CC would be great if it only focuses on Albus' adventure at Hogwarts. The pressure of a celebrity's son and getting sorted into the 'wrong' house alone could be a great storyline. But the writers want to include as many aspect of the original works as possible. They use time travel so they can include Voldemort, Snape, Cedric, Umbrige, etc. >! It's similar with time travel in Endgame, it's only there so we can see Peggy, Howard, Frigg, etc. It's also there so we can re-live the Avengers' adventure in MCU.!<

Fantastic beast also suffers from this. The first movie is good, it explores a life of a magizoologist, the anti-muggle atmosphere within the 1920s, and introduces some charming character. It went wrong in the second movie; McGonagall already alive, Dumbledore teaching boggart in DADA, LeStrange and Avery as a villain, the 'Credence is Dumbledore'. FB want to explores the rise of Grindlewald but it still want to be known as a Harry Potter movie, so they put a lot of aspect of the original works even if it doesn't make sense.
