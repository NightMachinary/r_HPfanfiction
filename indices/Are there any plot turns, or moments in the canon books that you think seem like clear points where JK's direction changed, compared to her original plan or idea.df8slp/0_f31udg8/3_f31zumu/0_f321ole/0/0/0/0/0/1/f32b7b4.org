Ahh, but one important thing we know about Petunia is she does love her sister. I can absolutely see her keeping a blanket-which is not a magical object-and hiding it away, neither being able to look at it because of her remaining bitterness nor get rid of it because of the small part of her that still loves her sister.

I agree on Cedric, it was a stupid plot point and ruins his entire character.

I actually really quite like Ginny in the Cursed Child (honestly, she's better realised than most of the books) and some of the conflict between Harry and Albus. It's a shame that the rest of it was contrived.
