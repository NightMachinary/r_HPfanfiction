I don't know if that's /too/ much of a strange factoid for Ron to know - I'm sure Charlie was always talking about dragons ;) (Honestly I doubt that 'everyone' in the Wizarding World knows /exactly/ when dragon breeding was outlawed and in what year/convention - they'd just know that it was outlawed)

In his case, I always felt he was the one to know/project how 'normal' wizards acted in their society - while all the more obscure factoids would fall more naturally to Hermione as exposition.

For instance, using an example from the modern US, Ron would be the one to know how the average American views the US Constitution - whereas Hermione would be the one to know the exact year it was ratified and the main writers of it.

It would have been nice to see some more disconnects between the 'book' wizarding society and the 'real' one - eg, Hermione reading a book on etiquette that's completely outdated or would be ridiculous in the current day, and Ron having to rectify that wrong knowledge.

The more obscure/theoretical the knowledge is, the less I think Ron should be the one to present it - after all, we see him from age 11 onwards, and he's not the most studious of characters (not a problem at all - but it does diminish his reliability from a reader's POV if he were to be the one to present the most obscure of facts that are supposedly /not/ known by most wizards). It also doesn't help that in his first scene on the train, he's fallen for a fairly obvious prank from his brothers on a spell (which would not really make sense for a wizarding child to fall for, IMO).
