  Hell even Crabbe and Goyle make it through to their final year and those two are hard left on the bell curve.

Are they ever depicted in any of Harry's actual classes in Book 6? It's canon that students can repeat classes, and even entire years - Marcus Flint is described as a 6th year in Book 1, and is still playing Quidditch for the Slytherin team in Book 3. Ergo, he must have repeated a year.

Ron and Neville were both members of the DA. I think it's perfectly reasonable to expect to see them both in NEWT Defense and Charms - they received the best practical Defense education of any Hogwarts student in decades, and learned the Patronus Charm for extra credit. The DA is the exception to the rule here.
