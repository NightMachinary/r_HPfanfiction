  Silent casting is a mandatory skill, introduced before Apparition, so we can assume that basically every adult wizard in the UK is comfortable forgoing the use of incantations

I think this is a somewhat questionable assumption to make. It's canon that not every student qualifies to take NEWT classes in every subject - McGonagall turns Neville away from NEWT Transfiguration for only achieving an "Acceptable" score on his OWL.

We're never explicitly told what the grade distribution for OWL scores looks like. If they're normally distributed (i.e. a bell curve), then most students probably score "Acceptable" in most classes, probably only scoring E's and O's in classes they're particularly interested in (or not at all). Being that the spellcasting classes are probably the most difficult in the curriculum, I'd be willing to bed that a lot of students probably fall short of meeting the prerequisites.
