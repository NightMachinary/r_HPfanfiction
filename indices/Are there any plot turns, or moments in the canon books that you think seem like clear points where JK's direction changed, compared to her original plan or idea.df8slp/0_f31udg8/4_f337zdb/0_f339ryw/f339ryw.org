On your final point, I think it reasonable that Ron and most wizard raised children don't know any incantations pre-hogwarts , though they might have a vague approximation of what they are. That is to say, they understand that waving a wand and saying something produces a result. Neville certainly doesn't suggest a summoning charm when Trevor is loose on the train.

Silent casting is a mandatory skill, introduced before Apparition, so we can assume that basically every adult wizard in the UK is comfortable forgoing the use of incantations (Note that i mean using spells, not learning them). It has the added benefit of being a safety measure against curious children.

shows what a child can do simply by holding a wand.

  And saying the magic words properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‘s' instead of ‘f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.

Implies that careless use of incantation can have severe consequences.

Based on this I conclude that there exists a cultural expectation that you don't incant around impressionable children, just like we wouldn't smoke or swear.
