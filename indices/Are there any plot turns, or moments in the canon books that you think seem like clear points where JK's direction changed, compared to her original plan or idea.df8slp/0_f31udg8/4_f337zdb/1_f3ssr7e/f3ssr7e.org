It did have aspects of this in earlier books with Hermione just being kinda clueless about mudblood being a slur and then finding out and being like...oh...ok while Ron is furious.

But then ruin it in later books with Hermione saying Voldemort and this being like this brave moment for her which...what? Why?

I get her not saying Voldemort because it seems the social ettiquette to not say it. But the implication is that shes uncomfortable to say it like how Ron is or Hagrid is. Which...why??? Shes a muggleborn in a world where Voldy was dead for 14 years before coming back less than a year ago and is in hiding. This moment happens in the begining of book 5 there is no reason any Muggleborn in Harrys year should be afraid of saying his name (yet).
