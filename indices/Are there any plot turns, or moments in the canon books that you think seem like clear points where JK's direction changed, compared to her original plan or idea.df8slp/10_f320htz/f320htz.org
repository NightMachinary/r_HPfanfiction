There's the known ones such as intending to introduce a younger sister for Hermione and a third cousin for Ron.

I would speculate that JK Rowling when she first began writing Philsopher's Stone envisioned magical vehicles as the main means of magical transport, before envisioning other means to service the story later, whilst still maintaing the original plot point of Dumbledore flying to the ministry on a broomstick.

JK Rowling is pretty good for the most part on following up on plot points she drops in each book, little is mentioned without future relevance.
