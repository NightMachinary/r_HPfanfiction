I don't know that it's a hole unless you mean that the Order (mostly Remus) probably shouldn't have known what it was. I think it's more a matter of poor setup.

First, Harry and Luna can hear the voices from the Veil, but there's no indication that Neville can. If he could, it would be better foreshadowing because they are precisely the three in the group who can see thestrals. Then, everyone can sense that there's something ominous about the Veil, but they don't know what. Harry reacts as if there's great significance to Sirius falling through it even though he has no reason to consciously think that--and it's even more so written that way...But the reader doesn't have enough to go on to quite understand what happened.

I don't know; the Veil scene feels /wrong/ to me in a way that I've never been able to properly articulate, but I don't think it's an actual inconsistency.
