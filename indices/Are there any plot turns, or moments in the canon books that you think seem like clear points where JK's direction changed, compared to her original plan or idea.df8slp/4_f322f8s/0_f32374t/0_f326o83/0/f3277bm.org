Yeah the veil scene bugs me too. I have read two fanfics that have actually used the veil to better affect and they were good. One was Hermione bringing back the Black family essentially and the other was in Mauraderlover7's fanfiction rewrite were Sirius gets to raise Harry. Her story is way closer to how I feel the veil would work than it was ever explored in the series.
