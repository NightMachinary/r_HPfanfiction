I wish Lupin's death had been set up, or came as a result of a fatal mistake, instead of being purely thematic. Pettigrew, the worst Marauder, had a significantly better and more meaningful death than Lupin. He gave mercy to Harry, his one good deed, and he paid for it. Lupin's death was a wet fart in comparison.
