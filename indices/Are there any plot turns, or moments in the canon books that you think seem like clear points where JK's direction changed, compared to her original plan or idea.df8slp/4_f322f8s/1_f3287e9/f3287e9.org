Lupin's (and Tonks') death at the end of DH wasn't about making sense to the plot, lmao. That wasn't important. [[http://www.mtv.com/news/2875408/j-k-rowling-remus-lupin-harry-potter-death/][It was meant to be thematic and poignant.]]

  "I think one of the most devastating things about war is the children left behind," Rowling said back in 2007. "As happened in the first war when Harry's left behind, I wanted us to see another child left behind. And it made it very poignant that it was their newborn son."

Like, dude, if you don't get the 👏parallel symbolism👏 of there being another orphan at the end of the war, then you totally don't get HP!!!

(Seriously though, Lupin's death was lame, and I don't like the idea of Tonks leaving behind a newborn baby to fight. The child is still dependent on breastmilk and maternal antibodies. It's not /brave/ to join the battle, it's plain irresponsible. It would be like Lily Potter leaving Harry in the nursery to join James in the living room.)
