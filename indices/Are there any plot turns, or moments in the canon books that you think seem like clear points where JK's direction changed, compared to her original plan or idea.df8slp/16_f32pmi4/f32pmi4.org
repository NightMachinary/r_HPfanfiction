Harry viewing the memories of the Lestrange trial (and later their escape from Azkaban) seemed to me like a setup for Neville to get an arc where he gets revenge-obsessed and then grows beyond it. We still get small bits and pieces of Neville's reaction to this and his growth, but it's not as interesting as it could have been.
