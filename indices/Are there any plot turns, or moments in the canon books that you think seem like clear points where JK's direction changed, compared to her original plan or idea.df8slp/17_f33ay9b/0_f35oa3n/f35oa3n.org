Hermione was meant to have a younger sister but JK Rowling realised it was too late to introduce her.

Whilst the comment from Ron about his mother having a squib second cousin in Philosopher's Stone was meant to come to fruition with the introduction of Malfada who attends Hogwarts after her family discovered she was magical (and promptly dump her at the Burrow). She was meant to be a source of news and gossip and a Slytherin foil to Hermione, but JK Rowling realised that no matter how nosy it just wasn't believable for a child to have access to so much information so eventually moved her purpose onto Rita Skeeter.
