Yeah its ambiguous. People like to bitch and say "crappy fanon!" when fanfic authors simplify it by saying it's an unbreakable charm that goes on all wands sold to children and it naturally degrades on their 17th birthday.

There.

Done.

Now the reader knows what it is, how it works, and how our heroes can circumvent it in their time of need.

You can even keep the "pureblood advantage" thing by saying that highly charged magical environments interfere with the charm, which is why underage magic doesnt get reported in Hogwarts, the train, Diagon, or old Pureblood Manors

House elf magic being able to replicate a different magical signature is also fine, but if you set that up in CoS, you should pay it off in some big way later in the series.
