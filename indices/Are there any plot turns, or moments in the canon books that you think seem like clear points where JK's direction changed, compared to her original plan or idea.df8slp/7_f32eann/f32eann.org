Not so much a plot turn, but I've never got the 'trace'. In COS, Dobby's magic in the Dursley house was immediatly blamed on Harry. Even though Arthur and Dumbledore would later cast spells in the house with no consequence. By OOTP, Harry was charged when he used his wand to cast the Patronus. So what is it? Trace magic in a muggle house not using a wand, or magic out of the house using a wand? They are inconsistent with each other. If the ministry tracked any magic cast by an under 17 year old, Harrys warning in COS should never have happened.
