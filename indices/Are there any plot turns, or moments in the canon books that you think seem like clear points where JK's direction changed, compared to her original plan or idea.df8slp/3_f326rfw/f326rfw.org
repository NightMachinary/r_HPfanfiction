I would not be surprised to find out that very early on, the books were going to be a villain-of-the-week affair, and Voldemort was an accident.

There's only like four "real" locations (Dursley house, Weasley house, Diagon, Hogwarts) where the plot can be progressed, and the vast majority of it is Hogwarts. Hogwarts is the thing that changes with character action, so it's what you measure the plot against. That works fine for villain-of-the-week, but it's absolutely horrible for the /death cult and open warfare/ thing.

That's ultimately why the plot turns into a slog in books 6 and 7. Hogwarts is so central to the story that you can't actually bring the conflict there until the end of the book, because the conflict has gotten so great that it would leave Hogwarts unrecognizable, something you only want to do once per book.

In HBP, that problem is circumvented by Dumbledore being OP and preventing the conflict from reaching Hogwarts, at the cost of Harry sleeping through the first year of the war that stole his godfather (???). In DH, the conflict has reached Hogwarts, but they don't go there until the end, so the conflict that's supposed to be motivating the characters seems to come to a complete halt.

PoA is a look into what Harry Potter might have been intended to be. No Voldemort, no multi-book plot, and it's most people's favorite. CoS and GoF could easily be written to not include Voldemort. It's not until right at the end of GoF that this whole Voldemort plot becomes completely inseparable from the main plot, and OotP is what actually puts it in practice.

So I guess this comment is now pulling double-duty as "what's your unpopular opinion." Voldemort was a mistake.
