My first thought is that the actual writing process went something like:

1. Basilisk plot (Hermoine petrified, Hagrid and his spiders, etc.)

2. Ginny being the culprit is the twist

3. Ginny's possessed by a generic cursed object

4. Turn the cursed object into a character

5. Cursed object is Voldemort

I suspect that steps 4-5 only became necessary later in the writing process. You can do steps 1-3 and come out with a complete story, but it's reliant on getting a timeline straightened out so coincidences line up, and setting up mechanics for possession that are believable and useful to the plot. That can get out of hand really fast, and at some point, may have gotten too tangled to be worked out in a reasonable amount of time.

Instead, JKR introduces the idea that the cursed item is, in effect, a character. Now, rather than coincidence and mechanics driving the plot, it's character motivation. It easily straightens out whatever convoluted mess she had written to justify all the events, but there's just one big problem: The plot wasn't actually designed for another character.

It's why the diary is unusually helpful about plot points it doesn't actually need to be helpful about. It's actually JKR writing the character into the plot.

It's also why the fact that the diary is "Voldemort" comes out of left field, and why Riddle is so different from real Voldemort. Going back all the way and writing Riddle in from the very beginning could have introduced as many problems as it was trying to solve. Instead, if you write him as an already-established villain, you don't actually need to establish the character in this book. He's already been established, you just don't know it until the end.

Of course, this is all just conjecture. I'm basically trying to reverse-engineer the story by isolating the story elements from smallest to largest, and figure out what could justify its existence based on the remaining parts. Writing is a pretty messy process though so it's hard to say what happened or how off-base I actually am.
