This is a valid storyline, but if JKR really did plan the ending from the start, Voldemort would still have to be the villain of Book 7, and back in the flesh at that. Maybe no horcruxes and no Hallows, but he still did /something/ to come back from the dead, and they would have to figure out what and prevent it from happening again. The /war/ might have been a mistake, but Voldemort's influence should be felt behind the scenes.

For a minimal change from the canon series, I'd rewrite Books 2 and 4 with former followers of Voldemort making their own plays--or even blood purists/followers of Slytherin in general. Maybe have Book 5 be about Sirius versus Fudge by proxy. Harry and Dumbledore have been trying to get him exonerated for a year by that point, and it's finally coming to a head. But Voldemort should still come back at the end of Book 6. Book 7 starts with Voldemort vs. Dumbledore playing a game of spies and assassins in the shadows. Dumbledore dies halfway through, and Voldemort mounts an attack on Hogwarts as what he hopes to be the /opening/ salvo of the war, but is foiled by Harry's sacrifice.
