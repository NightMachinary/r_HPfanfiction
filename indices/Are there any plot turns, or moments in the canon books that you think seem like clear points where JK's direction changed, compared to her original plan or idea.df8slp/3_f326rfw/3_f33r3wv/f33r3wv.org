You could extend the war with Voldemort a lot by simply going into more detail with his attacks through the newspaper or radio. You can make the world feel a lot larger simply by having a few:

"There was another attack this week. The hamlet of White Cliff suffered 58 dead and 9 wounded -"

"White Cliff? Isn't that where your great uncle lives, Neville?"

Or similar scenes, so that by the end of DH, everyone (somewhat important) has suffered from Voldemort. Maybe Seamus or Parvati don't return from the holidays. Maybe Xeno is killed in HBP. You get the idea.
