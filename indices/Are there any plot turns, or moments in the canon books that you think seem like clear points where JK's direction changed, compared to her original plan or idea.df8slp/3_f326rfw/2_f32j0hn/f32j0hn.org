Oh shit you're right.

An episodic villain-of-the-year would be a good (and classic) plot for a children book. I can imagine that this is JKR's first plan for the whole series. I don't agree that Voldemort is a mistake though. I imagine that all villain is somehow connected to Voldemort, and Voldemort is supposed to be back and defeated in the seventh year. HP is not made for open warfare, political dystopia, and all adult things, it's supposed to be a fun children's adventure in their magical boarding school.
