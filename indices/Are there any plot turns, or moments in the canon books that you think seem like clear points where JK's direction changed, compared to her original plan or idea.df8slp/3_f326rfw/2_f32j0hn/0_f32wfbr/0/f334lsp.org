Yes, it still tried to follow the rule, but since the series is leaning into YA territory with the political conflict and open warfare the last two books doesn't make sense. The series started to move away from the episodic format in the first four books in OOTP, but it failed horribly in HBP.

Even if we have the Astronomy tower scene, why didn't Voldemort do anything in the sixth year? It makes sense in book 5 because his return is still a secret, but there's no reason for the Death Eaters not to attack the Weasleys, burn privet drive to the ground, or even kill the Grangers, they are basically an open sport. I know he killed some people, but they're not someone close to Harry.

It makes sense for the villain of the year format if there's only one villain. However, we know that Voldemort is the main villain, he exist from the book 5, but barely do anything in HBP. You can't expect me to believe Voldemort waited for Harry to finish his exams.
