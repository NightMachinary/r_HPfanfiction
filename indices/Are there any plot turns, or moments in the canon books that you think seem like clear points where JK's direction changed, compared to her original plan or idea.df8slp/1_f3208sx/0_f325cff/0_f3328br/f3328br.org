It just seemed like there should be something that happened with her. Neville and Ginny already existed in the Harry Potter universe, and had narrative function before (Neville in book 1 & 3, Ginny in book 2 & 4). Luna came up in the 5th book, mattered a lot, and then every time she showed up later, she could have easily been replaced by another character. The only thing I can think of is the Deathly Hallows moment with her dad, and she's not there for that! I just think JKR had bigger plans at some point for her. The relationship, perhaps.
