Luna and Ginny both get shortchanged in the interest of keeping the story specifically about the trio the whole way through, but I don't know if that was really changing course on JKR's part.

That said, Luna's introduction could have been a great setup for a Harry/Luna pairing. A lot of people like to point to the Male Lead+Female Lead+Sidekick trope to justify Harry/Hermione, but I think even more common is Male Lead+Male and Female Sidekicks+Romantic Interest Introduced in Season 2, and that would slot Luna in perfectly.
