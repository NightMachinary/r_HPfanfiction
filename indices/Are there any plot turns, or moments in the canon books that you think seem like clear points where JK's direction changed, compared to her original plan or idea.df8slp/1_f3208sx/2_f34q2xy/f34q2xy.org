So, you know how Remus Lupin's name is really unfortunate for his character and pretty much is telling for anyone with knowledge of mythology/latin (As an aside, Pottermore had an article that gave a decent explanation for that, but that didn't exist when I read the books) that he's a werewolf?

I thought Luna Lovegood was going to be a romantic interest because of her last name due to that logic.
