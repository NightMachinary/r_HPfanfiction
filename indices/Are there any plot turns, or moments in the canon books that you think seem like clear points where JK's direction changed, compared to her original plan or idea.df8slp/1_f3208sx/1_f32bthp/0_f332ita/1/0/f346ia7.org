So there's no concrete birth year for Bill, but the consensus seems to be November 29, 1970 (possibly 1971). Fleur had to be born before October 30, 1977 for the Triwizard. Best case scenario, she was 18 when they met, and he was 24. Not the worst, but a little weird. Not a great example to put in a childrens book. She's like, 19 or 20 when they get married.
