15 and 18 is not as weird as the Fleur/Bill one. It's still not great, and again, not the best precedent for a children's author to set, but fine given that there isn't much that seems to happen between them. It seems like puppy love.

Remus and Tonk is a huge age difference (thirteen years!) but Tonks is an adult who has had a job for a while. She's in the Order, she's an Auror, and she had to grow up at a Metamorphmagus -- all things that make you mature. I find it a little less strange that Fleur/Bill, just because they started dating literally right out of school and got engaged within the year. I will be fair and say that as a quarter-veela, Fleur was probably forced to growup fast. Still not great though.
