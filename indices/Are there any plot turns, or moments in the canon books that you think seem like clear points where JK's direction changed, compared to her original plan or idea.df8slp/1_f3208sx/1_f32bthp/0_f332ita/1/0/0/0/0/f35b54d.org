I'd say 15 and 18 is just as bad as 17/18 and 24. If you're barely legal, don't date someone 7 years older...

The difference isn't as bad as an adult, but Hermione was a child.

Remus and Tonks was also pretty bad, but they're both consenting adults. Honestly their relationship just didn't scream "healthy" to me.
