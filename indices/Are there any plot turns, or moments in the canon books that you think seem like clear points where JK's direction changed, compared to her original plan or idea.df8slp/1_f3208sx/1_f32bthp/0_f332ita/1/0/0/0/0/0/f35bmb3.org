I agree that it's bad, but I suppose it's more normalized in pop culture? Young Nerdy girl no one notices romantically ends up with the celebrity is like, classic disney channel. Its not a good trope, and it's not a good age difference, but it's typical and we never see much happen between them (I think they kiss?). Doesn't make it great though. Basically all three are terrible examples of relationships. I'm trying to think of good ones....
