I think she deserved better. It always bothers me that there's one girl in the Triwizard tournament, and she doesn't do well. When she shows back up with Bill (which is weird now that someone told me about the age gap), I thought there would be significance to her return -- she brings Veelas to the light side, etc. Some kind of plot. But she doesn't do much, other than being a badly written french girl.
