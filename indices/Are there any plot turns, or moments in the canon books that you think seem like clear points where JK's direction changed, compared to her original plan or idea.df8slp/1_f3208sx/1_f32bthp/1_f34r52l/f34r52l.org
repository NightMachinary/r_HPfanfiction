I think there are two routes for making Fleur a worthwhile addition.

Either make her competent (because in the Goblet of Fire, she sucked at the tournament to the degree she was never in the running).

Or the funnier one, turn up her French stereotype to 11.

But if I hear anything barring a token mention of Veela... and blegh.
