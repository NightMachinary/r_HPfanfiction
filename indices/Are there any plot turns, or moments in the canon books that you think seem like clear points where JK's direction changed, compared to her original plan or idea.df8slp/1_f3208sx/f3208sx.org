I always thought Luna would have more to contribute to the series. I really thought the Dept. of Mysteries adventure would solidify that group of six, but it didn't really change the dynamics. It continued to be the trio.

I also thought Percy Weasley going to the dark side would be resolved in its own moment, rather than during the final battle. Especially since they were at the ministry.

Other characters I thought would be more relevant: Tonks (magic shape shifting powers seem useful, but instead she mopes around a lot), OG Mad-eye Moody, the Giants, Fleur, and Fleur.
