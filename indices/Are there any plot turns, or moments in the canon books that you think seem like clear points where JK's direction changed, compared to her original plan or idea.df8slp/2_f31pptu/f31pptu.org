I can't think of any, myself (in fairness, it's been a /long/ time since I've reread canon), but I know a lot of people thought that Fortescue's disappearance was originally meant to be a setup for the seventh book, since PoA established him as being knowledgeable about history and the owner of an ice cream shop is a pretty weird guy to single out as a casualty of war.

Personally, I always that he was just bumped off to reinforce the stakes and make a point that /nobody/ was safe, but it's an interesting theory, and it's definitely possible that Rowling /did/ intend it as a setup, but dropped the payoff in DH when she realised that Ollivander rendered his intended role redundant. If, say, she originally intended for Fortescue to be forced to track the Elder Wand's path through history while Ollivander provided his expertise on wandlore, I can totally see an editor telling her to streamline that plotline by dropping Fortescue and having Voldemort track down the wand himself.
