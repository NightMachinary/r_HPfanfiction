I see the end of Book 5 as the final time JK took the idea of actual fights between two characters seriously and in response in books 6 and 7 severely nerfs, Voldemort and Harry into the ground. I maintain this because through the books we see Harry being built up as a powerful wizard over time

In book one we see him overcoming the odds and succeeding in tight places

In book two we see him uncovering plots and using his mind in New ways

In book three we see his determination and power not just in learning The Patronus but also in his dogged (hehe) attempts to save Buckbeak and Sirius

In Book 4 we see Harry become more skilled and capable we see him putting what he learned in the first 4 books to work and see him matching and over coming competition who are willing to cheat and have a advantage over him.

In Book 5 we see Harry becoming a Leader, we see him sacrifice his life and happiness to stand up for what is right and we see him being forged into hero we presumed to need.

Books 6 and 7 throw those books away, in Book 5 we see Harry and the others but primarily we see Harry stop and knock out several Death Eaters with little difficulty, including a few inner circle members. In fact we see Harry is only really out paced by Bella, Lucius and Voldemort. It establishes that Harry while yes a school kid and not ready for war is ALREADY a capable and skilled wizard who puts others to shame.

Then in books 6 and 7 almost every battle is a running fight, Harry never stands his ground and properly defeats someone, he is Almost always turned around running casting spells over his shoulder or diving to the ground blindly casting up at someone or chasing someone and casting at their back and still getting stuffed. In spite of him kicking several DEs asses the year before and Crucio-ing Bella with no response the year before only to be nearly beaten by Draco, Incapable of casting Silently and totally destroyed by Snape who by all accounts till then was not overly powerful and only had wanded abilities in Darker Aspects of magic... Oh and would of likely be out of Practice for upwards of a decade as he had been a Potions Professor for 15 years at that point and a year of defense teaching, and yet he rofl stomps Harry.

I see the first 5 Books as written with the intent that Harry would eventually defeat Voldemort in a Duel to the death Harry coming through the experience a hardened man where he once stepped into it as a scared child. Only for JK to get cold feet after the Voldemort/Dumbledore duel and turn to the self sacrifice ending
