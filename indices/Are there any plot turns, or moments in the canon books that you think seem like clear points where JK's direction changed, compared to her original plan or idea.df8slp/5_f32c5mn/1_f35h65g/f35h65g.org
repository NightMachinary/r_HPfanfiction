Even if Pettigrew got away for the sake of Trelawney's prediction coming true, Sirius could have been clearer and the story wouldn't have taken any hits or forced major divergences.

Harry still has to go to the Dursley's for Lily's protection? Fine. He can do that for a week and go chill with Sirius for the rest of summer (Yeah, the â€˜needing to consider Privet Drive his home' thing could arguably be an issue but Harry already considers Hogwarts his home anyway)

Need the plot device of Harry having trouble communicating with Sirius for the tournament? I mean, he's in school. Harry can't be popping off to receive visitors every other weekend, even if Sirius was a free man.

Want to introduce the pain Harry of losing yet another important person in his life to the story? Do that. Having been able to experience some normalcy with Sirius for 2 years and getting that ripped away would make it even more heartbreaking.

I hadn't dwelled on it much till you mentioned it but yeah, this is a good one.

Clearing Sirius' name could close up a confusing plot point, would actually make sense, not make Dumbledore seem like a dick in context - and bonus, you could totally explore how Azkaban kept affecting Sirius even after his freedom.
