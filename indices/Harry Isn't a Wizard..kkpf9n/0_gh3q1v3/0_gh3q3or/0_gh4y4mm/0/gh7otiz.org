I read it a long time ago but I don't remember it having any bothersome tropes, in fact I quite enjoyed the story. I would add here that this was during the early part of my fanfiction reading career so it's possible that I flat out missed some tropes to being with.

The portrayal of the differences in the two magic systems was very interesting to read, especially how DnD focuses on the letter of the description rather than the spirit, and the DnD protagonist is always trying to min-max and generally "break the game" as much as he can.

Such a shame that it's still incomplete.
