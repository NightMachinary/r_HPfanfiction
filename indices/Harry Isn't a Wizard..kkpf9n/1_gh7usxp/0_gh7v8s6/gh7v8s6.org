Harry Potter and the Superhero Origin Story also has Harry capable of a different system of magic but needing to learn how to use 'normal wizard' magic, but the story itself (Harry is an angry foster child) is perhaps not what you're after.

I know of another story where Harry does very unusual magic, but in that one he doesn't go to Hogwarts at all so it sort of defeats the premise.
