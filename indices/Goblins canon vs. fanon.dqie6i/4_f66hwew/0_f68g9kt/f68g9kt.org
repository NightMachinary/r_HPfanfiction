There are a lot of things that I disagree with in Harry Potter. The portrayal of the goblins is one of them. I don't think the Sword of Gryffindor was all that amazing, just particularly famous in Britain. Another thing is goblin steel is made out to be kinda O.P. It takes in only that which makes it stronger? There is a lot of ways that can be abused.

I think my problem is that it goes against the common belief about goblins. In main stream media, goblins are vicious, greedy creatures who have a tendency to rape human woman. They are not particularly skilled in anything in specific.

In Harry Potter, however, they are relatively civilized, if sadistic, people that are exceptionally skilled in banking and smithing.
