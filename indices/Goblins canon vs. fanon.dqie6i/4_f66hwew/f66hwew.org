I am not sure about this but I have always thought that the trope of helpful!badass! Goblins came about before Deathly Hallows. Until then we didn't really know much about Goblins except for that great verse in the first book, that they seemed to rebel all the time, and the fact that they made amazing swords like the Sword of Gryffindor (which was also seen as much more important and relevant than it actually turned out to be.) They are also one of the most important aspects of Wizarding history, like when Hermione mentions some facts about Hogsmeade. So there can be a lot of reasons for that sort of portrayal.

Goblins are definitely badass, though. I mean, they enslave dragons and (possibly, dunno if fanon and Canon are messed up for me here) trolls. They turned out to be very different As Bill says, their way of thinking is entirely dissimilar to human beings. But even then I think with the right set up Goblins can be very interesting as a warrior race.
