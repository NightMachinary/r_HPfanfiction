Whoever said I was siding with the Goblins in the whole "the wizards are stopping the Goblins from being the warriors they wish to be" business? Having magical warriors running around is terrible.

't any rate, the best reading of the Goblins' immoral actions is in my opinion that /they/ are the horribly specist blighters, even moreso than the wizards. Not inherently evil, but culturally every bit as prejudiced against humans as Death Eaters are against muggle-borns. More broad-minded Goblins exist, but they get fired from Gringotts because it's institutionalized. (See: the emigrant Goblins in /Fantastic Beasts/.)
