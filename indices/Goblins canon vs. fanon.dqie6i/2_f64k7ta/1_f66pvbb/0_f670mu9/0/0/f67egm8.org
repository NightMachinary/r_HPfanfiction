It's not impossible for one to imagine a sweet romance between a free Elf and a wizard. I once dabbled with a completely wacky fic idea where instead of a Muggle(born), Andromeda falls in love with Kreacher's grandson, and things happen.

Either way, though, while dark, the idea of wizard-on-house-elf /droit du seigneur/ is also sadly plausible.
