I can't imagine where someone as sheltered and from as oppressive a household as Andromeda would even meet a Muggle. At least Ted being a muggleborn would mean they'd have relative freedom to interact at Hogwarts. I think people who grow up in predominantly liberal (as in the actual meaning and not politically) atmospheres underestimate how difficult it is to break the mold when you come from a background like this, particularly when you don't have legal and financial freedom.
