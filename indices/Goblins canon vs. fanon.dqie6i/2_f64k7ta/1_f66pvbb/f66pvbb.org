Goblins in the book/Rowling's supplemental material seem rather cruel and duplicitous.

You could make the argument that it's not representative of them, but reneging on deals and negotiating property deals despite having different definitions of ownership seems suspect to me.

I refuse to read helpful goblin fics because it's a terrible plot device and it denotes a poor understanding of canon, but while Rowling's books are filled with allegories to historical oppression, I don't think Goblins belong to the category.
