To be honest, when one says goblins I normally think of the Uruk Hai of Tolkien. That and crafting and weapon smithing goes hand in hand. A part of me thinks of them as similar to the ferengi. Therefore my fanon tend to be a mixture of that. Greedy warrior race.

Further more goblins exist is many different cultures in myths, that and that fantasy tend to portray them a lot. Most would view Hp goblins as either a civilised version. Most depictions are grotesque mischievous greedy gold hoarding creatures, most fantasy settings use them a enemy fodder thus warrior.

Hobgoblins and brownies mixed together become houseelf so that British European depiction is out of the window. So that traditional version is out.

Redcaps is also called a Goblin by mythology but in Hp they are a magical creature so not that depiction.

Erl-king in germanic version in myth is a goblin king along the lines of Jareth from labyrinth who is a high fae. But the fae, elves and goblin are often catergorized different in Hp fics.

In wizards of coast version tend to be a tribal creatures or some neutral creatures motivated by gold. A term loot goblin came out on stuff like these (dnd player who want all the loot). They tend to be starter enemies.

But all in all most depictions are they are not good nor belevolent creature, so a prevalent depiction of tribal and greedy nature of goblins is quite hard to overcome especially when the description of Hp canon goblin is reminiscent of a modern depiction of fantasy Dwarves/dwarrows with the exception of the links to money. Thus, it is easy to think them as greedy version of dwarves since they are called goblins definitely not dwarves. Dwarves are the go to mythical craftsmen and is a warrior race (Norse myth), Hp goblins tend to get the same treatment just removing the noble, honour and more brutish version like dwarves more reminiscent of darker tales about goblins.
