  Orcs are a race of bad guys that are irredeemable

Debatable. They are certainly seen as such by the characters in-story though.

  Killing them is morally okay in just about any situation

I think if it ever happened that Orcs went to meet humans/elves under truce it wouldn't be okay. Or if humans/elves went to Mordor and happened upon an Orc family peacefully tending to their fields (Do they have fields? Or families?). It just so happens that pretty much every Orc we ever hear about is an enemy combatant doing combat things in a war. There's no reason why killing them would not be morally justified. Just like (assuming our morals and not Orc morals) it is morally justified for the Orcs to kill human or elven soldiers who they fight in battle but it is not morally justified for Orcs to kill human/elven civilians.

I agree on the other parts, they are quite unfortunate. And while I might usually point out that in that time racism was rather common and perfectly acceptable, Tolkien was pretty explicitly against any concept of race or racial superiority.
