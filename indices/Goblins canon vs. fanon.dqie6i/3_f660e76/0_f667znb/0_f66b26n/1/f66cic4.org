I wasn't referring to Tolkien's goblins specifically. I was speaking in a broader sense. The most obvious examples I would mention:

- Orcs are a race of bad guys that are irredeemable. Killing them is morally okay in just about any situation.
- All the "bad guy" humans are vaguely Middle-Eastern or Asian.
- Numenoreans are a literal master race of humans, and their blood being diluted with "lesser" humans is seen as a tragedy.
