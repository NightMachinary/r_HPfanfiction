It's pretty likely that you've read it because it only gets recommended on here /constantly/, but Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay has the absolute most cinnamon-roll-esque Harry I've ever seen in a fanfic.

Literally the closest he gets to getting angry is internally grumbling about Dolores Umbridge and not really /doing/ anything about it because she's pretty harmless in the long run (at least in this story). Most of Harry's problems are solved just by him being nice to people (him being a dragon, and thus immune to pretty much everything, helps). linkffn(13230340)
