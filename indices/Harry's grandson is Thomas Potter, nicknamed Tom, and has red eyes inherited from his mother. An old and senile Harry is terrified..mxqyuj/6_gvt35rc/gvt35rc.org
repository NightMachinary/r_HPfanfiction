The baby, when born, was bald and pale. Later, there would grow white hair on his head, and he would dive in books because it wasn't just Harry who was disconcerted about the eyes; all the adults who survived Voldemort were, with good reasons, and all the kids were, because they picked up their parents' fear and because red eyes are different and, according to most books in existence, evil or demonic.

And so Thomas Seamus Potter grew up alone and isolated, with no idea what caused it or what to do about it. He wasn't a bad kid at all: kind and gentle and just a little bit too observant for comfort. He drew portraits of what he saw, showing people as they were in his perception: Old Malfoy regretful and sad but guarded, Scorpius a bright white flame, Ginny with a spark of happiness, George with a smile that never reached his eyes and so on and so forth. ‘It's not that he isn't /kind/,' Molly said, who he had drawn while taking over some task despite her age. ‘It's just... does he have to be so, so...'

‘Perceptive?' Harry suggested.

‘Yes! He just goes on baring /my soul/ to all and sundry! It's like he reads minds!'

Harry sighted, looking fondly at his own portrait, which portrayed him as young, wand in hand and sweeping downwards, like he's attacking the observer. Vague shapes in the background make up his friends and family.

‘He's talented,you'll have to give him that,' he said. ‘And he's a good lad. Already he's helping Pomfrey out as much as he can.' He paused.

‘And he likes teaching.'

‘A bit like...'

‘The resemblance is uncanny,' Harry agreed grudgingly. ‘Ginny...'

Ginny had a harder time than most, dealing with Tom. She made a effort to be kind to him, of course, and she never treated him differently from her other grandkids, but she couldn't bear to be in his company for long and she was clearly exhausted at the end of any day when he visited. He looked so much like the old Tom, she had said. Not even in his face or hair but in the expression on his face, the quiet way he reads, even his politeness and genuine care...

Molly's face softened. ‘This must be very hard on her,' she said.

Harry looked at her. ‘The boy must never know,' he told her. ‘He'd never forgive himself for looking like Ginny's old abuser, for reminding her of that miserable bastard. And he really can't help it.'

Several years later, Harry was back in the Chamber, Tom Marvolo Riddle in front of him, commanding the snake to kill him over Ginny's dead body. He knew she was dead, because Tom was completely corporal now, and he knew he was going to die because his arm was too weak to hold the Sword. There was poison dripping from the snake's fangs. It dropped on his lips and suddenly Tom was forcing him to swallow... ‘A creative way to kill me. What, biting wasn't good enough?' He wheezed through the fluid. Tom's answer was lost on him.
