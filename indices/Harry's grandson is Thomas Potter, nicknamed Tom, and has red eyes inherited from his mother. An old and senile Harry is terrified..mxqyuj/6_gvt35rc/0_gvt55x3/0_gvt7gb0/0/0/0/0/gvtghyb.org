Pt 3

When Tom next entered, some week later, his Grandpa wore that lazily happy smile that either said ‘/I am awake and lucid and life is great/' or ‘/I am in the midst of a happy dreamworld, do not disturb/'.

‘Hey Tom,' he said and Tom exhaled with relief as he set to work preparing Harry's breakfast.

‘Hey Grandpa,' he said. ‘Had a good night?'

‘Marvelous,' was the reply, but there was a sad undercurrent in his voice that Tom noted despite himself.

There was a pause while Tom sprinkled the oatmeal in the milk and watched it as it simmered.

Harry coughed. ‘I am sorry, Tom,' he said simply.

‘Whatever for?' Tom asked the milk.

‘I thought I did what's best for you when I made them all promise,' Harry said, evenly. ‘I never thought I'd end up in such a state.' He chuckled darkly. Tom stirred the oatmeal and threw in some more, along with raisins. ‘You know about the eyes, of course,' Harry continued.

‘The eyes of Voldemort,' Tom stated.

His Grandpa would be wincing now, Tom thought, but he didn't chance a look. He had to set it a bit lower and keep stirring, or else it would boil over.

‘Yes, well, about that...' Grandpa trailed of.

‘I dreamt a lot about you,' he said suddenly.

‘I noticed,' Tom said dryly, resisting the urge to tell him exactly how much it had hurt him. /It's not his fault,/ he reminded himself as the oatmeal thickened and he decided to add honey.

‘I know,' he said. ‘And I can't tell you how sorry I am for everything I said and did to you back then, while you were making lovely oatmeal and giving me medicine and all that. I-I can't believe ho-how...,' he paused and sniffled. ‘Goddamnit I can't even wipe my own nose!'

Tom looked at him, uneasy. This wasn't at all usual. Grandpa waved his hand dismissively. ‘Don't worry about it,' he said. ‘It'll be over in a few. Anyway, I just can't believe how you just kept putting your whole heart in caring for me while I was being a right bastard. And... actually it's more Ginny's story to tell than mine, but we don't have much time,' he said, pausing to gather his thoughts. ‘You see, when she was twelve, she got this diary from Malfoy's dad.'

‘The Death-Eater?'

‘That's the one,' Grandpa said, nodding. Tom set the oatmeal lower, stirred the medicine in and scooped the oatmeal in a bowl.

‘We didn't notice because it was hidden in other books, and Ginny and I weren't that close, back then. But as it turned out, Voldemort's soul was in that book. Now, Voldemort used to be called Tom Riddle but no-one knew that, so when Ginny saw the inscription, it never occurred to her it was dark magic. And when it wrote back, well, she just thought it was a new type of diary, not at all unusual. By the time she began noticing the book was unsafe, it took all her willpower to throw the book away in a toilet and flush it through.' He smiled grimly. ‘Brave little Ginny. He manipulated her in the most awful way, you know. It wasn't just possession either, though that's bad enough... Told her she had so /loved/ writing in that book... that she had /chosen/ to pour her love and soul into it, and that she would have nobody to blame but herself if he exposed it all to her crush; the Great Harry Potter. So she stole it back from me, because I had stumbled on it and thought it was odd, and naturally twelve-year-old me thought the best way to investigate it was to keep it right next to me in the dorms. Next thing I know, she's taken to the Chamber of Secrets. Turns out, he rose from that diary, grabbed her, and used her life to feed his own and confront me.' He paused and blinked at the spoon that was halfway out of his mouth and smiled as if he wanted to say ‘aren't you a sneaky fellow' in the most fond way possible. ‘Now, the thing is,' he continued while Tom snuck another spoonful in. ‘That while Tom Riddle was dark and handsome, and you're as pale as a Malfoy, you do share certain similarities. Not necessarily in face, but rather in... character and build, I am afraid. Like Riddle, you are bookish, perceptive, clever. You are of similar height and build and according to Ginny, you have the same expression when you concentrate. Of course, the biggest difference is that while Riddle used his knowledge and perceptiveness to hurt and manipulate other people, you use them to /help/ and you would never, /ever/ be anything like Voldemort,' he said, suddenly looking very stern. ‘No, I want you to know that. I myself have wondered as well, because I share the same background and characteristics, but Dumbledore told me -‘

‘It's our choices that make us who we are, rather than our abilities,' Tom recited.

‘Very good!' Grandpa said, beaming toothlessly. ‘Now pick up your spoon.' Tom blinked. Apparently he had dropped it during the story, probably at the point where his Grandpa told him he was a lot like a murderous dictator in behavioral tendencies.

‘Is that why Grandma can't stand to see me draw?' He found himself asking numbly.

‘Fraid so,' Grandpa confirmed. ‘And...' he paused. ‘The reason I have given you hell... is because it kinda tripped me up as well. I was dreaming, but that's no excuse to be a dick. Will you forgive me?'

‘You were always forgiven Grandpa,' Tom said softly.
