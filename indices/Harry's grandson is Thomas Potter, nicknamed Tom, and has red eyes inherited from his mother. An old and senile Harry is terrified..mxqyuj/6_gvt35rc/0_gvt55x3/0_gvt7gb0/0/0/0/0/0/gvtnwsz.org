/Grandpa wants to see you,/ the note read. /Bring your drawing stuff./ And then, more worryingly: /come at once./

When he came, he found both his grandparents in bed. Grandpa looked relaxed and lucid, and Grandma had a determined expression on her face.

‘I -we- want you to draw us,' she told him.

‘Are you sure?'

‘Very sure,' she said. ‘Draw us as we are.' She paused. ‘It's not just for him, y'know,' she said softly. ‘Or to prove that I can do it. It's just... I want a memento, a way to remember him old and happy.' There was red around her eyes.

‘And I'd love to be drawn by you,' Grandpa added. Tom had rarely heard his voice this strong in the past months.

‘Very well,' he said.

With soft pencil lines he began to draw the outline: Grandma's hand around Grandpa's waist, her head and shoulders steadying his, the other hand flat on the blanket... ‘Don't move,' he said absentmindedly as it curled into a fist. Grandma inhaled and exhaled deeply as - with great effort, it seemed - she steadied her hand on the blanket again. ‘M sorry,' he muttered automatically, recalling the stolen moments when he had tried to draw her before, before she caught him and looked with that faintly disturbed look. Now he knew why. His hand drew everything that sat still for long enough, it wasn't her in particular, but still... he could see how it might've been disturbing now. The legs he outlined a bit more blurry, so they seemed to be one being. They were under the blanket anyway. Carefully he drew Grandpa' mess of hair (“Were you born a hedgehog or something?” Tom had once asked) trying to shake the memories away of joking and laughing about it. Soft green eyes, beaming with happiness, were next. The face, half-slack half relaxed, with a soft and happy smile, seemed to melt in a pronounced shoulder that led to a warm and freckled face through a half-hidden neck, at one side by a sharp chin and at the other side by long hair, red with streaks of grey in it. He cursed a bit under his breath when the mouth didn't come out right, but thankfully it was salvageable. That was when he remembered the scar, which he carefully added on Grandpa's face, barely visible among the wrinkles. He added details on the clothing and the blankets, drew the nightstands with wands - one on each side of the bed -, and checked if he had forgotten anything. There, a freckle just under her left eye he had forgotten, and a wrinkle he'd missed. When he looked again, Grandpa's eyes were closed and it had grown darker out, he saw the night fall through the window... what, the window?! Crap, he'd forgotten to draw the window! Hastily, he added it and turned the page to start a new drawing, intending to draw his grandfather sleeping, when Grandma spoke.

‘I am sorry, Tom.'

He looked at her face, then at Grandpa, and realized... ‘No. No, it cannot be...' It couldn't be.

‘He's... he's dead, Tom.'

They looked at each other over the bed, and somehow it was no distance at all for two sobbing people.
