Pt 2

‘Grandpa,' Tom pleaded. ‘Grandpa, /please/...'

His Grandpa, who had always been genuinely kind to him, who had always stood up for him, that very same Grandpa was now spitting at him, pushing him away. ‘Gramps?'

Harry's head lolled backwards, finally exhausted from the struggle. From under his lidded eyes he was staring at Tom. ‘You killed Ginny,' he whispered. Then, raising his voice to a hoarse half loud speaking level he repeated: ‘you killed Ginny, you bastard!'

His efforts apparently spent, he went back to moaning and muttering.

‘Here, let me.'

Tom turned around. ‘Why does Grandpa think I want to kill him, Grandma?'

With nothing to do but watching Grandma coach some fluid into her husband, soothing him that she was alive (‘is he gone?' ‘Yes, dear, you defeated him. You always do.') watching her tired smile, he suddenly felt lost. ‘He's nothing like this with anyone else,' he insisted. ‘It's just me. Why is it just me?'

Ginny sighed, looking at him. ‘I promised him. He made us all promise. The truth would hurt you too much.' She smiled softly. ‘You have his character,' she told him, gesturing at Grandpa. ‘And he /does/ love you very much. You just wait until he gets lucid. He always asks after you, if you've drawn anything new. Insist you shouldn't draw him like this.' She grins briefly. ‘I think he prefers his glory days.' Her eyes flicker towards the old painting of him, framed on the wall opposite him.

‘This is hurting me too,' Tom insisted, before realizing how whiny he sounds. ‘I am sorry Grandma. I am sure it's just a bad day, eh? One of his nightmares he woke up from in the middle of giving him his medicine and I just happened to be there.'

He paused. ‘He dreamt you were dead. Killed, in fact. Would it help if... next time... I stand behind you while you feed him? So he can see I didn't... ki-‘ he cannot bring himself to finish that sentence.

They've beaten Voldemort and having a victorymeal in front of his dead body. Ginny sits opposite him and feeds him porridge because she thinks it romantic, and he accepts, bemused that the House-elves have already prepared a meal, when suddenly Tom Riddle rises up from Voldemort's body, wand in hand, right behind Ginny. Harry tries to rise, but he is so, so tired and something is forcing him to stay seated as Tom starts laughing, a high and cold laugh that seems to say; /What, did you think it would be/ that /easy?/
