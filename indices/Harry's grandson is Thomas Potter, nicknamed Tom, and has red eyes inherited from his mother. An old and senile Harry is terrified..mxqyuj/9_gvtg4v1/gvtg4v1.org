Still like the plot and prompt but I thought Voldemort's eye's changed color because of too much dark magic and the horcruxes. He wasn't born with red eyes. I don't think his eyes were red in the chamber of secrets.

It would make more sense. If an accident happened to Tom Potter that changed his eye color later in life.
