Harry was rubbing the shoulders of a terrified James Sirius Potter. "It's alright son. I have utmost faith in Dr Longbottom. Helen is going to be alright."

"But she's screaming, dad! Why... why did I even try..."

"You're asking me?" Harry smirked, "Your dad? About why you decided to make babies?"

James stopped, than blushed. Harry laughed.

"Don't worry about it, we'll soon have a healthy baby."

"But... But George had a baby so quickly. Why does Helen have to---"

"Every baby takes their time, unfortunately. That's something no one can really predict. It's alright James, it's alright."

Helen's scream tore through the corridor for an instant, and then everything turned quiet.

"Do you think...?"

Harry was smiling brightly.

Molly was already turning the baby bag inside out, confirming everything that needed to be there, was. Albus was distracting himself by making and vanishing his Patronus, an octopus.

And in that moment, the doors opened.

A healer, exhausted but smiling, held out a tray, in which was James' son. Sleeping away, not caring about anything in the world.

James just looked at his son, even as everyone around was congratulating him. His eyes were tearing up.

"A healthy baby boy. Helen is also safe, though very exhausted," said Frank Longbottom, smiling ear to ear.

And then the Baby opened it's eyes.

And Harry's heart sank. "I'll... I..."

James turned away from his child. "What happened?"

"Nothing," Harry shook his head. "I'll prepare the house for him. Bring him home, son." He forced a smile.

James looked concerned but nodded anyway.

Harry apparated away.

He entered his study, locked the door, and with unsteady hands, activated the portrait of Ginny.

"Hey Harry!" Ginny's painting came alive, waving at him from beyond a wall he could never breach.

Harry teared up. "Sorry for waking you up, hun. Just need a bit of an advice."

"Happy to help, Harry!" called the painting enthusiastically.

And Harry knew, in his gut, that this wasn't really Ginny, just an imitation.

Regardless he pushed on. "I... I think, Voldemort has reincarnated into this world."

The portrait looked shocked. "What? Did some Death Eaters manage to find another Horcrux? How?"

"No, nothing like that. That Voldemort is dead, I'm sure of it." Harry steadied his breath. "Though, I think, Voldemort's soul now lives in the body of my grandchild."

"Why?"

"He looks too similar. I remember those memories Dumbledore showed me, Ginny."

Harry took a deep breath.

"He has those red eyes."

The portrait looked shocked. "I don't know what to say," it stated. And Harry nodded just the same. It was just a portrait after all.

"Thank you for helping me clear my head." Harry stood up and deactivated the portrait.
