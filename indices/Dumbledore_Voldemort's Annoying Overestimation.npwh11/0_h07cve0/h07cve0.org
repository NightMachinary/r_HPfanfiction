I agree to some extent, yes. But the thing is, you'll probably get more leeway from the fandom when making Dumbledore, Grindelwald, Voldemort, or perhaps Nicolas Flamel be the top dogs around than, say, random OC number 1558483893 or something.

Depending on how it's done, it can be very easy to end up turning whoever this OC is into an annoying Mary Sue. And when using non-British OCs for this role, it's also easy to slip into the cocktail of clich√©s surrounding 'magical Britain bashing', including things like:

- Insulting Hogwarts (i.e., calling it 'Hogwash') and making the foreign schools so amazingly perfect (and yet Fleur, the Beauxbatons' champion, went down to a bunch of Grindylows in canon).

- Calling magical Britain backwards, while making the rest of the magical world be so perfect and tolerant of everything (and yet Durmstrang outright rejects Muggle-borns, and Madame Maxime preferred to hide her giant heritage wherever she went).

- Bashing the usage of wands, and saying that these silly Europeans are so ridiculous for not going wandless.

- Foreign-magic wank, similar to what fanon often does with goblins and house-elves.

Etc.

I know it's fanfiction and all, but there are some things which are more likely to deter readers than others. Inserting some random super-powerful OC tends to be one of them.

Basically, my view is that when it comes to pushing a different character/OC into surpassing or equalling Dumbledore/Voldemort level, then you'd better keep the writing tight and avoid the super-easy temptation of bringing along the usual bashing that accompanies it.

It's a different case when the character is balanced out by the fic, though. If Amazing OC or whichever canon character is given Dumbledore levels of power are placed in a decent plot, then it's more likely to be believable, and tolerated by readers. It's just too bad that I've seen more than a few fics where the author tries so hard to 'one up' canon with their Dumbledore/Voldemort 2.0, as if almost saying, "Oooh, look at my super-amazing hero/villain who's soooo much cleverer than batshit insane Voldy or the stupid old goat!!!!!"). No. That comes off as being pretentious at times.

I've seen quite a few readers avoid powerful-OC fics for exactly the same reasons that I do, and not just in terms of the OC fulfilling the role of Harry. Heck, it's sometimes worse when everything's the same up until that point in the plot, and then Amazing OC shows up and saves the day just like that.

It's not impossible to give the power to some other character besides the big ones from canon, but it can break the suspension of disbelief when this person is just so absolutely wonderful and used as a self insert. Then there's the odd chance that the author might use Amazing OC as a mouthpiece to rant against their (the author's) frustrations in canon as well (it tends to show up as little quips or jokes about canon events, e.g., someone saying, "As if I'd be stupid enough to send seven Potters out in the sky.").

I'll say it again, people can write about their amazing non-Dumbledore or non-Voldemort characters being at the top, yes, but do try to adjust the story accordingly. It's highly likely to turn into the same power-wank-fest that the typical Independent!Harry story suffers from, if left unchecked.
