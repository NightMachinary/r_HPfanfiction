Yeah, I get all that. But what I meant is that people tend to give more leeway when the 'known big three' are overpowered in fanon, rather than having some random person show up or be mentioned.

I guess I forgot to say that some readers like operating within the confines of canon to some extent. Just as some people might like seeing a refreshing new face being mentioned, so do others like seeing Dumbledore and Voldemort be on top time and again.

Different strokes for different folks, I guess, but the clichés do seem to be more prevalent in fics which try to 'outdo' Dumbledore and Voldemort with someone else.

Good writing will, as you've said, have the other OP characters be accommodated by the plot in some way, though it's more likely that the average fic will fall back onto clichés in order to 'justify' the inclusion of Amazing OC.

Even when using canon characters, it's easy to slip into bad-writing mode. For example, making McGonagall be super-powerful, putting stupid Dumbles in his place, and fixing the whole of Hogwarts alongside awesome, OP Snape et al.

It's tough to get it just right when bringing in more powerful characters.
