I don't know much about the impact on the plot that such a powerful OCC could cause because I don't really write anything, I just read it, so I'm going to accept your opinion on that. About the "attack on Magical Britain", I don't care too much, as long as it's reasonable and rational. Yes, it is possible that there are countries that are more tolerant of magical creatures and blood status than Britain, but it is also possible that there are countries that are much more rigid about this.

Describing Beauxbattons - where most students are described as futile and snobbish, their champion scored the lowest in the Triwizard Tournament and their headmistress hides her own heritage out of shame - as the apotheosis of tranquility and freedom is ridiculous. The same goes for Durmstrung, who is canonically discriminatory and has a special emphasis on the Dark Arts - let's not forget that they let a Death Eater become headmaster and that it was Grindelwald's school, after all, before he was expelled.

I'm kind of tolerant of OC's as long as they're well constructed and organically included in the story. White Squirrel's "Accidental Animagus" series is particularly good at this point, inserting an alliance between Voldemort and some foreign Dark Lords/Ladys, with Harry and Dumbledore having the help of Great Sorcerers from other countries, making them Lords/ Ladys of Light in some ways.

I don't like Mary's Sue's either, though. I find it frankly unrealistic and quite illogical when someone appears and magically solves all the problems in the world, finding the cure for lycanthropy, destroying the Dementors, killing all the Death Eaters, making Voldemort a brainless idiot and Dumbledore a worthless old man who does nothing but give second chances and cast Stuners - and we won't even get into the topic of "Harry randomly becoming a super-wizard-god-of-magic-lord-of-all-legendary-families" in two weeks, with the right to a shopping trip to Diagon Alley, Lily secretly being a thoroughbred, helpful goblins and a new magic chest with a mansion inside.

However, what annoys me is not necessarily that Dumbledore and Voldemort are powerful, because they are, it's just that it's unrealistic to say they're the "best, biggest, smartest, most powerful, meanest/kindest" that exist or ever have. You don't need an OC's directly present in the story, however. You can just name some random country under the command of a horrible Dark Lord/Lady that will never have any relevance to the plot, except to show that they are not gods. You can point to some super healer, duelist and sorcerer who lived two hundred years ago and battled "the Darkness", too.

Everyone has their opinion, obviously. It's just the accumulating clich√©s that continually test my patience.
