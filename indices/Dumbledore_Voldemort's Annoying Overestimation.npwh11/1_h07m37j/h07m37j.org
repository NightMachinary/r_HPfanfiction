I mean, in-world, it makes sense. It's a pretty common thing for people to do. We exaggerate the things that affect us and ignore or minimise those that don't. We do the same with pretty much everything - sports teams, musicians, wars, heroes and villains, etc.

It'd be quite bizarre for someone in Magical Tibet to say Voldemort is the GDWOAT (greatest dark wizard of all time :D), but a British person would absolutely say that about him because they've probably been terrorised by him. Similarly. the Tibetan Magical would say that a Dark Wizard that's affected their neck of the woods is worst. As a real world example - for someone who lived through World War 2, it might be the worst thing they've ever experienced and they'd title it as such. But WW2 would be a distant thing happening in a far off place to someone in rural Indonesia. It's all relative and personal.

Also, describing people with titles like that is less a statistical or descriptive thing and more a cultural and emotional one. They're titles that reflect how people feel about them, rather than any quantifiable measurement of scale. To British People, Dumbledore is the greatest wizard in the world because he's affected their lives directly and they've been raised in a way that frames him as such. They won't care if Bob Marcowiecz from Russia has more quantifiable magical power than him, because he's someone else's wizard that they'll never encounter.

It's basically like a verbal version of those "World's Best Parent" mugs. There was no competition defining the 'best parent', but people still feel those kinds of things because of their emotions regarding their parents. Meeting someone else who's 'quantifiably a better parent' won't make you feel any less positively about your own parent.

When writers do it... /shrugs/. The fandom is weird.
