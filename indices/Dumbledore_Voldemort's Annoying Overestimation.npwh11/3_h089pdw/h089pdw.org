I relate everything I read to a teenagers point of view which is how we are viewing the world of canon. Harry was a kid the whole time in canon and not even particularly curious about larger world. He asked "There are other schools of magic." In 4th book and wasn't even aware of his own paternity, as he didn't even tried to look too hard. So maybe the world is larger, Maybe the world is richer in culture and history than what harry knows. We don't know anything except what JK tells us, we can create on own, speculate and discuss.
