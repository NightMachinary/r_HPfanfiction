I actually don't mind it personally.

Too many characters makes for a poor story and having characters more skilled/powerful than Dumbledore or Voldemort tends to just turn into a bash magical Britain story.

That's not to say that there shouldn't be more skilled adults, but having more than a handful of people able to even hold off Voldemort takes away from his threat.

Voldemort was known as He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named out of the country too, and despite his setbacks in canon, was probably only matched by Dumbledore with a mythical wand, 5 decades more experience, and a phoenix.

That being said, I do find the lack of truly skilled lieutenants in canon lacking.
