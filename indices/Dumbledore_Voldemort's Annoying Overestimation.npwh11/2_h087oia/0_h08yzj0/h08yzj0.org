It's a bit boring, isn't it? You hear horror stories from the Death Eaters, how they terrified people, how they were deadly and cruel, but most of them seem to only have Unforgivables in their arsenal and nothing else. Snape, Bellatrix and Dolohov seem to be the most dangerous diners, but Snape wasn't even on Voldemort's side, Bellatrix was killed by an overweight housewife and Dolohov only appears once or twice, with his only memorable feat being almost killing Hermione in the Department of Mysteries. I'm not even going to talk about Lucius or Rookwood, who got beaten up by a bunch of semi-trained kids.

On the "light side", you have McGonagall, who looks reasonably stronger than most wizards on Canon, but as I recall only fought during the Battle of Hogwarts; Kingsley, who helped to contain Voldemort for a time with the help of Slughorn and Minerva; Sirius, who died because he chose to play and laugh over taking his psychotic cousin seriously (I still cry and feel like strangling him whenever I remember) and the rest of the Order, who were said to contain skilled members, but I've never seen anything big.

I always felt a little disheartened by the lack of lieutenants to fight on both sides, instead of kissing Voldemort's robes and looking at Dumbledore with stars in his eyes.
