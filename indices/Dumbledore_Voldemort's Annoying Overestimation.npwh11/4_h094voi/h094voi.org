Well, Dumbledore was canonically the one who defeated Grindelwald, who, as you said, helped start a World War. If there were people more powerful than him, then it probably stands to reason they would have taken care of Grindelwald first. So, yes, he is almost certainly the most powerful wizard of his age unless you want to invent some reason why either someone more powerful than him didn't take care of Grindelwald first or didn't do anything worth mentioning. We also have no idea how powerful the Founders really were, all we know is that they helped start a school and were excellent wizards for their time. I really don't see how it is going against canon to make Dumbledore more powerful than the founders when we have no idea how capable they would be present day. Voldemort had Dementors working for him too, so I don't see how that makes Erkizdis more powerful than him. Voldemort almost certainly would have managed to create a conflict as large as Grindelwald did if he hadn't had chosen to try to take Britain where Dumbledore lived as opposed to Grindelwald who avoided Dumbledore as much as he could. Don't forget Dumbledore also states he avoided Grindelwald until he felt he couldn't anymore. Grindelwald performed better because of his past history with Dumbledore and his better tactics, not because he was more powerful than him.
