I can tell by the 67% that this request has been downvoted pretty heavily, and I know it's because of Snape. Sad but true. I've given up on defending Snape on the fandom's behalf. For me, he'll always be the greatest character, but unfortunately there are a lot of people out there who don't see it that way.
