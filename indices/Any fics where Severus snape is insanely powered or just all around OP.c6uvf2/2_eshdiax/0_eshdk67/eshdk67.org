  ***Re-write of Death's Apprentice*** Severus Snape has always been in hell, whether dead or alive. Death values those who are not crushed by being handed an impossible hand in life, and Severus Snape was one such person. They only come once an age, and each is as valuable as the last. When Tom Riddle made horcruxes, he cheated death, and, if the three brothers are any indication, Death does not take kindly to being cheated. Severus awakes in his fifth year of Hogwarts with a new wand and old memories, not to mention the magical potential to match the most legendary of Wizards. His peace of mind is a small price to pay for such a gift, especially when Lily doesn't hate him, he has yet to loyally pledge to the death eaters, and Albus Dumbledore is willing to work with this enigmatic fifteen year old to end the war--not to mention that the Marauders might actually get punished for nearly taking his life, and come to regret their actions in the process.
