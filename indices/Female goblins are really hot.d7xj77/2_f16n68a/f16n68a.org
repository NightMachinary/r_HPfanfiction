Oooh! Veela are the females, Goblins are the males, and humans are too dense and racist to realize they're the same species. Each trait is only dominant in the same gender. Only female veela will have veela daughters, boys will take after the father, whether it's goblin(in which case, normal goblin son), human, or giant. Likewise, a goblin only has a veela daughter if he marries a veela - Flitwick has a normal human sister.
