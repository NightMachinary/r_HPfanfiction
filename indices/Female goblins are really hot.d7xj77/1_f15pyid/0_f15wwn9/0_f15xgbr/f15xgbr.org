Nah, Xanth started out as pretty typical 70s fantasy - including the latent misogyny (Chameleon can be hot and stupid, bland and unnoticeable, or smart and ugly - depending on the time of the month) - with a heavy dose of whimsy. Later, as its charm and humour devolved into endless series of puns, Anthony's distressing tendencies towards hebephilia started coming out and it got creepy.

I /think/ the bit about goblin girls came up in either /Question Quest/ or /The Color of Her Panties/, but I haven't read them since I was a teenager and frankly can't be arsed to look it up. This was a sort of second Renaissance "high point" for the series, before the story quality started downhill again.

But so it goes.
