Standalone, a horror novel called "Firefly." I highly /dis/recommend it.

His Xanth novels tend to be more innocent, but have some uncomfortable subtext. Lots of mostly-naked pubescent teenagers running around with older men. Come to think, the Mode series has that too... And the Battle-Circle Trilogy... And Bio of a Space Tyrant...

Teenage me had utterly no grasp of subtext, unfortunately.
