One of the most difficult things about growing up/older is looking back at the things I used to love, and realizing just how problematic they actually are. /Some/ of his books are fantastic - but that doesn't mean that they don't have major issues. And it hurts all the more because they were something that I very much enjoyed reading when I was a teenager, and now looking back on them the flaws stand out in stark contrast to the joy they once gave.
