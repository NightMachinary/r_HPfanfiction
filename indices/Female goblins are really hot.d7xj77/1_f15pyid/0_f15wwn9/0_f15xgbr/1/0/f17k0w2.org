Hardly his worst, either, though... which similarly says a lot. I'm honestly a little surprised there isn't a fanservice-filled anime out there based on the Xanth series, given the focus on panties in the later novels. It would be the perfect setting for an isekai series, seeing how many Mundanes end up in the magical world...

That said, I recall the merwoman (Mela?) being an adult, so... older than 16? I can't recall what the threshold was for joining the Adult Conspiracy, though, and most of the characters around her were tweens and young teens, so she might not have been that much older than them to be perceived as an 'adult.'
