Oooh, maybe it's like the dwarfs in the Discworld series: Since they are underground dwellers, the big-shots, the most important movers and shakers, live in the deepest caves and never go up to the surface because the surface is all rubbish and doesn't have a solid roof. The ones you do meet on the surface are generally nobodies or poor people who can't afford living in the deep, or emmissaries who make the surface contacts and take care of necessary above-ground deals so that the big kahunas don't have to.

If the HP goblins are the same, then Gringotts banking would be seen as an important but unpleasant job; you need to be up on the surface to deal with the humans, because we need all the trade and also they don't start killing us if they see us as allies... but it's a chore rather than an honour; the rich and important goblins don't have to sully their hands with it.

Combine this with the matriarchal idea, and there's why we only see male goblins: The girls are in the deep down and do the Big Important Stuff.
