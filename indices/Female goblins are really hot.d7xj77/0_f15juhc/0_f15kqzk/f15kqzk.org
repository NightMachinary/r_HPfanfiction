  I've also considered the idea that Goblin society is matriarchal, for which reason all the Goblin wives get to just enjoy a life of luxury living off the riches produced by their husbands, while they are stuck doing all the work, which is the reason the Gringotts workers are all males and grouchy.

Conversely, I'd find it more interesting if Goblin society is about more than just banking, and the truly important work is mainly done by the women out of sight of wizard-kind. In that case the male goblins at Gringots would be grumpy because they have to do the less exciting flunkie labor to maintain the front.
