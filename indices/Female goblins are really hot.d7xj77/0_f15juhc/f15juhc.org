This could actually be canonical, as a matter of fact, if it weren't completely tonally off. The one female Goblin we've ever canonically met, in the /FB/ movies, is way more attractive than any male Goblins we've seen.

That being said, I've also considered the idea that Goblin society is matriarchal, for which reason all the Goblin wives get to just enjoy a life of luxury living off the riches produced by their husbands, while /they/ are stuck doing all the work, which is the reason the Gringotts workers are all males and grouchy.

Of course, there is always the possibility that there /are/ female Goblins among the Gringotts workers and they're just never pointed out in particular. Maybe because Goblin females are indistinguishable from males for humans who don't know any better, or maybe you just disregard the movies' depictions altogether and imagine there were female tellers as well.
