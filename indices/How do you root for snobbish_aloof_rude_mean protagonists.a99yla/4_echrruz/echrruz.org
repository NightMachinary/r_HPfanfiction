I don't think I have to root for anyone in particular to enjoy a story. I might be rooting against the main character, or just enjoying how bad things are.

I'm writing a story in which the main character is an arrogant, overconfident snob, and I'm pretty sure my readers are following along like, “Oh boy, how will he manage to make this already messed-up situation even worse?” It's my most popular story by far. He's much more popular than my nice guys.
