My random thoughts which may or may not have any correlation with reality; Jerk, Serious, Invincible, pick any two.

So you can have a jackass who uses his Wizengamot seats (plural) and supreme magical power for silly shenanigans, or a serious villain protagonist who encounters many setbacks, or a sincerely good super-duper hero for whom things just go right. But you can't have a bastard protagonist with oodles of inherited power making him unstoppable, /and/ be all dark and dramatic about it.
