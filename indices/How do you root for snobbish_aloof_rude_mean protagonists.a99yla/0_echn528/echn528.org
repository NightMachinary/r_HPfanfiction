Abrasive protagonists are some of my favorite to read. They need to have at least one redeeming quality, though. As an example, Dr. House is an unrepentant sarcastic misanthrope, /but/ his actions show that he cares for his patients' wellbeing above all else, and he breaks any laws or regulations that impede the outcome he sees as right. He's also undeniably masterful at what he does.

We like House because we see past the attitude he presents to the world. If, as in the fics you refer to, that surface dickishness is all there is to the character, there's no reason to root for them. They need deeper drives that one can relate to.

To answer your question of how to root for them, you simply do or don't. If you feel the need to ask advice for how to enjoy a character, you're reading the wrong story, I think.
