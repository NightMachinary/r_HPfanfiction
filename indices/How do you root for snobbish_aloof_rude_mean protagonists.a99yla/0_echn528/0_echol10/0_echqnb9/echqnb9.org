  So is there a fanfic equivalent, a mindset to get into when your enjoyment of the plot is hindered by some of the characters?

I don't believe there's any special mode of thinking that will enhance your enjoyment. It's a question of whether the parts you're interested in outweigh the parts that repel you. Speaking for myself, I would rather be reading something where I liked both the plotlines and the main character, at the very least. The story will center on them, after all, and if you don't care for them, you won't care what happens to them or how they develop, and as a result you won't care for the majority of what you're reading.

I wouldn't watch a sitcom for the story of one character if I disliked the rest of the cast, either; I'd spend more time annoyed than not. That's me, though, so it depends on you and what you consider worth your time.

Edit: Your comment doesn't merit downvotes, so I'm confused. It's a normal conversation.
