For me it depends a lot on the fic/show. Sometimes there are certain characters or the world or the plot I like more than I dislike the other characters and I can go through the story for that. But at other times, as much as I want to move forward with the story, those characters keep hindering my enjoyment and I give up.

An example of the former is the Shadowhunters TV show where I don't like Clary, the protagonist, but I love the way the show has built up on Alec and Magnus' relationship and I continue to watch the show (fowarding a few scenes sometimes). However, I tried reading the books the show is based on and my favourite show character Alec is such a dick in the first few chapters that I ended up giving up on them. (Which I hate because I used to be a firm supporter of 'The book was better')
