To keep with my previous example of Black Luminary, I enjoyed the overall world building, I enjoyed Hermione's depiction, I utterly loved the batshit insane Lestrange daughter. The plot is fascinating and unique. But the most important characters aren't appealing to me at all.

I mean, you could watch HIMYM just for the awesome Barney stories, even if you didn't like one or two of the other characters. So is there a fanfic equivalent, a mindset to get into when your enjoyment of the plot is hindered by some of the characters?
