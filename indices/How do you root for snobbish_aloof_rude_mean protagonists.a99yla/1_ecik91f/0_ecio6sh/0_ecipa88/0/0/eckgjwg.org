King's dream speech was only about humans, and is indeed a utopian idea. Inequality is a salient feature of all societies, there simply has to be hierarchy for a society to stay afloat without collapsing in on itself. Equality can exist in name only, never in practice.

FF authors extrapolate King's idea to include all manner of creatures, like centaurs, goblins, werewolves, vampires and whatever else. Centaurs hate humans and consider themselves superior, while gobbos have declared war on witches and wizards for dominance. Werewolves and vampires consider humans as food.

There can be limited diplomacy with centaurs and gobbos, but with werewolves and vampires, none can ever happen. It'd be like treating with xenomorphs.
