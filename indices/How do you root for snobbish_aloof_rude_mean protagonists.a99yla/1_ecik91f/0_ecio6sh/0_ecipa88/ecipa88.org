I personally have no problems with these fics, so long as their premise isn't outlandish, like Harry/Hermione being adopted by Voldemort or something equally ludicrous. I've read a lot of stories where purebloods, or wizards in general are hated by the MCs, so the alternative - where the MCs hate muggles/muggleborns - is fine with me.

There are also many fics where the MC advocates for a humanist utopia where all manner of creatures are treated equally. I find that idea unrealistic as hell, so some hate and scorn would be much appreciated.
