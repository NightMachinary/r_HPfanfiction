I mean, Amy Lestrange is a blast to read and I'm pretty sure that I'm going to use it as inspiration for a "Demelza Robins is, unknowingly, the daughter of Bellatrix Lestrange" oneshot.

But the Daphne characterisation was so annoying, her only redeeming quality was her rack. And Harry, I found him alright until he killed a few thousand people through negligence and didn't bat an eye.
