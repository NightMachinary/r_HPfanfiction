I've enjoyed and 'got into' plenty of abrasive and unlikable characters in fiction (Lando Mollari, Chrisjen Avasarala, Walter White, etc), so I know there's nothing "wrong" with me.

Fact of the matter is that fanfiction authors usually have no idea how to write them. It's interesting you brought up Black Luminary which is full of characters that I despise and don't want to read about. I think I've mentioned this before: Fanfictions get much less leeway from me in regards to giving the characters the benefit of the doubt. I quickly jump to the conclusion that the characters being unlikable is a total accident or - worse - intentional, not to make them interesting, subversive or anti-heroes, but because the author thinks they are cool.
