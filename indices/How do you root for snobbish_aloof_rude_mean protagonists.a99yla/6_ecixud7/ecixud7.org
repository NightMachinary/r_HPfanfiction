Well, there is Death Note, but Light Yagami at least has a straightforward goal, specifically to stop crime.

While Light is understandably fairly insane by the end of it, he also wasn't entirely wrong to do what he did, because he practically succeeded.

If the protagonists are just jerks for the sake of having a reputation as a jerk for something like social standing, then that isn't particularly likable, even if that social standing could mean the difference between life and death. This is magnified by the fact that this would be Out of Character for Harry as well.
