You had just the right mix of humour to balance out how grim the story's backdrop was. 1990s was a pivotal time. Politics were going bonkers. Computers were rolling out. You were rapidly going from tapes to CDs, VHS to DVD, and any number of other major shifts all over the place.

You caught the sort of climate of the time of a teenager in your typical suburbia school, as well as the mood of the students. Everything from feeling powerless all the time, down to how arbitrary things were in general by people in power.

I would fully support a sequel.
