Hey! I'm happy to know you enjoyed it and very much appreciate your thoughtful comments on it.

I think you're right in particular about that very lengthy section in Luna's narrative, and I can see I need to go back and ask myself what I'm trying to accomplish there.

I'm really happy those bits from Neville's section in particular moved you -- I think that may have been one of my favorite parts in terms of the overall story and character interactions.

Thanks so much for your comments on the characterization; I'm very happy it seems to have worked out! Particularly Ron, he was a great challenge as he doesn't really fit into a particular stereotype, and he has a lot of very real traits, strengths, and weaknesses, and it was important to me to preserve his... Ron-ness? XD ... in translating him into the "real world."
