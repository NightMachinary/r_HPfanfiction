Enjoying so far.

Finding myself getting bored by the backstory/lore explanation about Harry's past. I really really don't need the diversion into Harry's past. I can put two and two together to figure out that you'd kept it cannon when Harry had told Draco not to talk about his parents. I could further put together that he's probably sitting on a bunch of money from the speculation that Draco gave. Luna musing about it is causing it to drag, and frankly bludgeoning me over the head with something that you've quite clearly alluded to already.

Then the action picks right up again, and it's good again. Until we go more into a character's musings after the 10:15 time marker. I can figure out that Harry is annoyed at the interruptions, and just wants to space out for a while. You've already made that clear. I don't need to see a detailed accounting of what's going on in his head, because we've already been through it. Mentally waving my hands, and going "ok get on with it already."

That said, this paragraph of exposition was perfection. /chef's kiss/

  Luna tensed but did not give him the satisfaction of a response. She had been written up for kissing Padma in the quad at lunchtime -- apparently that was ‘causing a scene,' while Michael Corner and Ginny Weasley doing the same thing twenty yards away was totally normal -- but that wasn't what had landed her in detention.

Perfect amount of what's going on in Luna's head without a ton of diversion from the action. Perfect balance right there.

Here's another spot where you goddamned nailed it:

#+begin_quote
  “I don't need you to speak for me,” she said curtly, staring Harry straight in the eye, somehow more upset with him sticking up for her than she'd been with Malfoy. Harry didn't know why, but was certain he didn't deserve it.
#+end_quote

Exactly the right balance of glimpse of thought, and moving it along.

This bit is good, the rest is dragging:

#+begin_quote
  His dad had never been harsh with him, but there had always been a certain frustration in the way he tried to manage his son's concerns, with suggestions like Just try to make friends and Just stand up for yourself -- like Neville hadn't already thought of that. And then there was the one that his father never said directly, but which Neville heard loud and clear anyway: Just try to be more normal.
#+end_quote

It's a really powerful moment that you're diluting with the rest of the musings. Especially when you follow up with this line:

#+begin_quote
  “I think...” Neville swallowed. “I think it's the first time he's ever been proud of me in my entire life.”
#+end_quote

You have extremely powerful writing, but you're watering it down with repetition.

I really really really like the characterisation of both Ron and Neville. You've done a fantastic job with them, and I love how you're seeing their characters unfold. It's cannon, but it's not trite, you know?

This right here. This is GOLD.

#+begin_quote
  “And I'll bet you complained about it, didn't you? And told him exactly what you'd done.”
#+end_quote

Overall, EXCELLENT story, and very enjoyable to read.
