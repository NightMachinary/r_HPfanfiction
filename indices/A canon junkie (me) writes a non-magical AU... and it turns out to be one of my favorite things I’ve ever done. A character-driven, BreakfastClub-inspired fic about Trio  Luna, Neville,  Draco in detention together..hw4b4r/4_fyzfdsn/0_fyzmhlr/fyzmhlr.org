Haha! Actually not Tom Holland even though that pic does kinda look like him. It's a model named Linus Wordemann, whom I use sometimes as a Ron (and/or Percy!) face claim, because as much as I love Rupert Grint, he is not my mental image of Ron. :) As you can see, I also used a different face claim for Harry.
