I think I might be too much of a gremlin for validation to have any problem with you popping in to say nice things about this fic. XD But really, thank you so much for your enthusiasm!

I was in the same boat as you, sort of thought of Muggle AU's as boring because, well, what's the point of HP without magic, right? That's why we love it. But I'm on a site where I've interacted with a bunch of people are into Muggle AU's, and I started reading them and I can see the appeal in playing with the characters that way. <3
