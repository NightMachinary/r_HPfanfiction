I feel like I pop up whenever you mention this fic, but I promise it's because I love it and not because I'm stalking you.

The characterisation, humour and pacing in this fic are all incredible. I thought I was pretty firmly in the camp of 'non magical aus are boring', but this has singlehandedly changed my mind. Really recommending it to anyone browsing this thread!
