AAAAAHHHHH I LOVED IT!!!! god it's so hard to find muggle aus that don't just go straight into romance and this fic was just perfect I loved how the different characters had their distinct personalities and like you really kept them in character! (Ok maybe except Draco cos in the books he would have never talked to Neville voluntarily) but i really loved this different version of draco, he has rich boy problems but also got the nosy attitude that book Draco has.

I mean basically I love high school au so this was just perfect for me! Thank you for this great fic! It was well written, the pacing was just nice and the characters were just evenly and nicely fleshed out. Loved it ðŸ’•
