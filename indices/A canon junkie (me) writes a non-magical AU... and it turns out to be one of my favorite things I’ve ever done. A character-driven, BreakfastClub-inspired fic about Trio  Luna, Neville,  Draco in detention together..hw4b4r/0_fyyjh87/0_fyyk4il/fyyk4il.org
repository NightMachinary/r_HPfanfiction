Wow, thank you!! <3

Yes, I admit that with Draco I had to make certain modifications, and hopefully it makes sense why I had to. He was the perfect antagonist to propel all the interactions, but I did have to dial back some of his canon traits because I didn't have 7 books to be able to redeem him, I had 8 hours and 20k words. XD Therefore, I couldn't make him a raging bigot, but I could take the fact that he's a spoiled, obnoxious shit-stirrer and identify that it comes (at least in part) from insecurity and a parent who is a dick, forcing him to be something maybe he isn't all that enthused to be.
