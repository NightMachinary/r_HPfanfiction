It's because of the fact that someone has been plagiarizing a shit ton of stories found in the DLP Work By Author section recently. It makes it hard to stop that, I imagine, if copies of the work are being circulated outside of the site. And furthermore, if an author hasn't moved a chapter from the Work by Author section to ff.net or similar sites, it means he/she feels it isn't ready yet and still wants to work on it before publishing. One would be a dick to go against them like that.

Just saying.
