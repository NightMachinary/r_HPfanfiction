The thing is though, sometimes FFN will go through and delete things that are in violation, when that author is no longer active (thus isn't going to post it elsewhere, or might not even know it was removed), or in some cases authors have actually died and /can't/ repost.

I don't like fiction hunt because it does it without consent, but because of how fucky FFN can be sometimes, I'm a little more sympathetic about it.
