#+begin_quote
  This subreddit should not become an enforcer for other sites
#+end_quote

Actively distributing material via this subreddit is quite a bit different from informing someone about the existence of a site where they might obtain something that a third site doesn't want that second site to have because having it violates the third site's rules which no one here has anything to do with.

Reddit isn't the internet's nanny.
