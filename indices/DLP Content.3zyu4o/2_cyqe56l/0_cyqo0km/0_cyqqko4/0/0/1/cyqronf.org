I think it's wrong to refer to other sites' TOS since those are not under the control of this site, and could be changed easily.

Wording the rule to state that distributing stories against the will of their authors would be better.

This subreddit should not become an enforcer for other sites, but focus on enforcing the wishes of the authors.
