  So would you be open to having a rule that stated: Do not violate the Terms of Service of other sites (including DLP's WbA forum). This could leave room for other violators to be judged by the same rule.

Yeah, I suppose it's the fairest way to implement this.

  And if there were no sites where posting MA stories was allowed, I'd be quite sympathetic to this view.

The problem with FFN is the very selective enforcement of their rules. It can be hard to tell if you're in violation, and even if you are.. you may or may not at some undetermined future time have your story taken down without warning. And they certainly won't respond to inquiries.
