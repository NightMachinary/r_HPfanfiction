I wish they would make things like that more obvious. There is literally no place where you can see information like that. To 90% of users, there aren't even any admins at all, and even when there are problems, they usually get resolved without so much as a note on a tumblr. Though I'm sure some of that desire for privacy comes from backlash to the MA removal and related bs.
