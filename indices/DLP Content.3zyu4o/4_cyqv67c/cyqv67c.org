Am I the only one who thinks this new rule #6 is a little far-reaching? I mean..."do not violate the TOS of other sites" that's kind of a HUGE rule. Which other sites? All of them? How the fuck do I know if I'm violating the TOS of some random fucking site I've never been to? I mean really, could you make a MORE broad rule to ban people? That's a rhetorical question, by the way.
