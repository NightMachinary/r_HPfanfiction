It is not really a good rule, given that we do not know what other communities have as rules. "Don't post slash" for example could be a rule, and technically, posting a slash story on reddit would be "circumventing that rule". It's rather clear that this is not intended, but the wording makes that a valid conclusion.

That's why I think we shouldn't refer to any other TOS, but name the specific action - distributing works an author doesn't want distributed.
