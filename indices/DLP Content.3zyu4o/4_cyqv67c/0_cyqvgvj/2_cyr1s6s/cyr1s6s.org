I like this version a lot better.

I'm not sure why, but the original version of the rule annoyed me and I elected to go have lunch and see if it still annoyed me when I wasn't hungry.

Came back and saw this instead and thought: "That seems perfectly reasonable."

I still don't know if I was just hangry, but I like this version of the rule.
