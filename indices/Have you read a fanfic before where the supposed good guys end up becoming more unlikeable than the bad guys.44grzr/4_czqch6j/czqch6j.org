First of all, "unlikeable" is definitely a word. As for fics, /Rise of the Wizards/ did this for me. It started off as a guilty pleasure anyway, but as Harry began to really throw his weight around, reading his POV became even more unpalatable.

Also seconding Firebird Trilogy. That really takes the cake.
