I liked the fic when I first read it. then halfway through I started thinking /"Wow, Harry is more of a magic-Hitler than Voldemort ever was"/

Also I say that this fic portrays "manipulative" Dumbledore really well.

P.S. meaning Harry is one paranoid motherfucker who sees things where there are none = Dumbledore actually is one of the good guys
