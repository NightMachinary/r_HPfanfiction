Not the story itself, but the how the story came about. Basically 50 is a fanfiction of Twilight, Alexandra Quick harkens to that. I want to read fanfiction of Harry Potter about the Harry Potter characters, not about some OCs that in some way mirror Harry Potter (I get that vibe from your description)
