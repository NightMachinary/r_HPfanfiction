Okay, so basically it's set in Magical America, and it starts out somewhat similarly to HP - girl is raised Muggle, finds out she's a witch, goes to magical school - but then it gets really dark really fast.

It's /extraordinarily/ well-written. I would go so far as to call it the best-written fanfiction ever, better even than the original series. However, a fair number of readers don't like the main character, mostly because she can be infuriatingly stuck-up and stubborn. TBH I find it a very accurate portrayal of a somewhat maladjusted, aggression-prone teenage girl.

The first book (/Thorn Circle/) is pretty good, but the plot can be a bit dorky in places, and it's a lot of exposition. Once you slog through it, though, books 2 through 4 (/Lands Below/, /Deathly Regiment/, & /Stars Above/) are truly spectacular to read, and the plot and character development are astounding.
