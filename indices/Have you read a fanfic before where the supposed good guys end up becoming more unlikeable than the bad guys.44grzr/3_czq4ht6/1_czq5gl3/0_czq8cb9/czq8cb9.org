What's the point if finishing a story where I hate, loathe, want to die a most horrifically painful and agonisingly slow, protanganist? Not to mention, the author should stick to what he's good at and writing a story isn't one of them. It felt like it was just barfing words, it didn't move. I'd rather read The Grapes of Wrath, which was as dry a book, I've come across.
