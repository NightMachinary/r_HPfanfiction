Powerful!Harry can work, but only if it feels distinctive from the others in its respective subgroup of powerful!Harry fics.

/Nightmares of Future Past/ works well, because Harry is not omniscient. He's often wrong, and the actual writing style is good enough to ignore the cliches. Harry remembering the past and pondering the new present makes the changes in character easier to swallow--Neville's development is gradual for example, and Ron and Hermione still feel very much like themselves. Luna doesn't get enough focus, but I laughed hard at her Patronus.

Or, for a more traditional powerful!Harry fic, there's /The Buttefly Effect./ Due to an unforeseen sequence of events, Harry is raised by Kingsley and Mad-Eye from /birth/ with the implicit intent that they were training him for war. And the fact that Harry is raised in an environment where he was taught to harness his accidental magic and use it as a tool allows for some leeway. The fic isn't great, but it's still better than the vast majority of powerful!Harry fics.
