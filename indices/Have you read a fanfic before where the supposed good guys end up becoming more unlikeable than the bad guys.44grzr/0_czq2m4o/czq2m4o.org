Yes. Fics like "Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness" or "Knowledge is Useful, But Power is Power", which have completely annoying, unrealistic, self-righteous protagonists, do make me wish Voldemort would just murder them all. "What Would Slytherin Harry Do?" makes me wish Fudge and Umbridge threw Harry in Azkaban, because he is so smug, so confident in his supposed cunning, and completely witless. Basically, in 99% of fanfics the protagonists are characterized so bad that I end up rooting for the bad guys.
