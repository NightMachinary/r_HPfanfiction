  This world has no need for her, offers no destined paths and fated battles, for it is not hers to save. [Was never meant to be saved.] But Harry --- Harry, whose father was brave enough to face Voldemort head on, whose mother was brilliant enough to outsmart him, Harry, who has Lannister blood running through her veins and magic purring under her skin --- Harry will reshape it all the same.Elyanna Baratheon is born with the breathtaking, terrifying might that is a life free of a prophecy's shackles. Luckily, she's got twisted family drama, an ill-timed reawakening of the Magic of Old and the powder keg that calls itself the political climate of Westeros to keep her occupied.
