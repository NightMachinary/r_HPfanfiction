I brainstormed a little... Most of these middlenames are nonsense though. Also lots of Nordic names cause I'm Scandinavian so that's what comes the easiest to me

AA L MM OO T V Y

ALMA VOTMYA RIDDLE\\
Alma (from Latin for "nourishing", also Spanish for "the soul" and Hebrew "young woman")\\
Votmya / Tova-My /this 100% could be a real name. "Y" - and thus My - is difficult to pronounce for Brits and other English speakers though/

YLVA MOTAMO RIDDLE\\
Ylva (Nordic, from "Ulf" meaning wolf)\\
Motamo / Tamomo / Momota

MOLVA TAMOY RIDDLE\\
Molva\\
Tamoy / Maoty / Tymoa

MAY MOLVATA RIDDLE\\
May\\
Molvota / Lova Tom /lol Merope just chucked Tom's name in there cuz she loved him so much? Lova is a real name though/

MOA MOLVATY RIDDLE\\
Moa (Swedish, unknown meaning)\\
Molvaty

I kinda like the sound of Alma Votmya but I would personally probably rename Voldemort to something else (if I were to write a fem!Voldy story), to get a name which meaning fits the character.. the names in HP are very fun with lots of different meanings and hints about the character (like Albus meaning light, Tom meaning twin while he's so lonely and also it's a common name which ofc Voldy despises, /Remus Lupin/...)
