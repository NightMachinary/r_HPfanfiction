Have you read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966][The Second String]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Eider_Down/pseuds/Eider_Down][Eider_Down]]? "Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort."

It's Harry in Marauders era.
