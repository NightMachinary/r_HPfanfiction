/Harry wants to meet his parents, Draco wants to avenge his father and Hermione just wants to keep the future from changing! When this unexpected trio is shot back through time they are unaware of just how much their actions are reshaping their world. And due to jealousy, lust and betrayal the boy who lived may not even exist in the future./
