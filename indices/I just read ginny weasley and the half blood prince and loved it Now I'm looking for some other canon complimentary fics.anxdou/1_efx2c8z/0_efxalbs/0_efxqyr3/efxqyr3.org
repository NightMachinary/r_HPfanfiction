In that case I'll second Floreatcastellum's /Not From Others/, especially since you just read /Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince/, as it is the exact thing I did when I finished that fic. The author has two more stories in the same universe, /Aurors/ and /Hollow Ash/ that are both incredible (well /Hollow Ash/ is incredible so far, but it's almost done). They are both from Harry's pov and are more like detective/auror stories than a straight continuation of /Not From Others/, though still very, very good. Thea is my favorite OC in the fandom.

Annerb is the author of /The Changeling/ and the subsequent /Armistice Series/: /pick it up, pick it all up and start again/, /we can still be, who we said we were/, and /in my head we do everything right/. /The Changeling/ might feature the best characterization of Ginny in the fandom. I recommend every single thing written by Annerb. There are 12 HP stories on Archive of our Own and 11 on fanfiction.net.

Deadwoodpecker is another great author. /Socks/ is a personal favorite. The /Backward with a Purpose/ series is one of the best of the timetravel/doover genre. However my starting recommendation for this author is /Blackbird/.

None of these are "hidden gems" or anything, as I'm pretty sure all three authors feature prominently on the top recommendations for Harry-Ginny pairings. I strongly recommended a trip through their "top recommended" in [[/r/HarryandGinny][r/HarryandGinny]].
