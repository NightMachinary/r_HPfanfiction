Holy shit holy shit, I've been waiting for a while to recommend the following fics. They're in french, and I've pretty much read everything worthwhile in french and english, but I swear those ones are the BEST in any freaking language. Please please take the time to read them. They will just blow your mind. So, here they are :

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2211674/1/Les-Secrets-d-Hermione][Les Secrets d'Hermione]] :

Shitty title? Yes. This is not a Hermione centric fic. It's more around Harry, it starts at the 6th year (after the publication of the fifth book). There is two volume, and together they have more words than the whole HP saga. The author has the same age than JKR, and her maturity shows in her work. It's very well written, and it takes every details from the previous books into account, and you'll be amazed by how she managed to give a very logical plot to follow the cannon. This is my all-time fave, and I'm a bit ashamed to admit that I read it 4 times.

Next, is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1278287/1/Les-Portes][Les Portes]] :

There is no way you haven't heard of this Time-Travel masterpiece if you are in the frenchspeaking part of Fanfiction. It's a classic, and a beautiful use of Time-Travel. It follows Harry and Drago, who, in their fifth year, find themselves in Hogwarts circa marauders. It's not a slash, they're not besties : everything is believable and, here again, well written.

Bref camarade francophone, je te conseille très vivement de lire ces deux histoires, et si jamais (pour des raisons vraiment occultes) tu as du mal après les premiers chapitres, CONTINUE!
