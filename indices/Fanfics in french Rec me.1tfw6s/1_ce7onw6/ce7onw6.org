[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/983391/Tinn-Tam][Tinn Tam]] has a story written in French, her native tongue, though if you follow DLP stuff you've probably come across her work.

[[http://frenchsession.fanficauthors.net/][FrenchSession]] on Fanficauthors.net has several translations of the site's stories along with a few original stories. The translations in particular I've found useful for gaining familiarity with the language (open the English chapter in a browser tabs next to the French and flip back as needed when encountering a passage one can't parse).
