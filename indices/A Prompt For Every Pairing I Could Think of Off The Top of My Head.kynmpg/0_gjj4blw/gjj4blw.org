Ah, why not? I can take a teeny break from my Kingdom Hearts longfic (342,000 words and counting!)

*Harry, Katie and the Couch*

"Harry, what...is that?" Katie asked, staring at her husband.

"This?" Harry answered, hefting the weapon. "This is a halberd. It's a polearm, traditionally used in two-handed combat, especially against cavalry."

"And why do you have it?" Katie asked, putting her hands on her hips. "Harry..."

"I was thinking this would be perfect for the couch--the proper couch that is. This is far too long to be effective in the love seat."

"Harry...darling...husband," Katie said slowly. "Why are you planning on putting a weapon in our couch?"

"Protection!" Harry said excitedly. "This would be absolutely a measure of protection."

"Protection from what?" Katie asked. "Nargles?"

"No..." Harry said. "Why, has Luna said anything?"

"She hasn't actually," Katie said. "Though she'll probably be by before long, she left her slippers behind the last time she came for tea, and as I understand it, she's been barefoot for the last week."

"Ah," Harry chuckled. "Classic Luna."

"Harry, enough about Luna for the moment," Katie said. "What do you think we need protection from?"

"Death Eaters out for revenge, regular renegade dark wizards, dementors, any number of Hagrid's pets except for Fang..." Harry said counting off on his fingers. "Umbridge, Rita Skeeter..."

"Skeeter?" Katie asked. "Is she why you've lined all of our windows with screens and tazers?"

*ZAP!*

"Yes," Harry said. "I find that most effective...now, setting the halberd aside, what should we do with this katana?"

"Katana?!" Katie shouted. "Harry, where did you get a katana?"

"Kreacher found it from a friend of his in Chicago, if you can believe that," Harry said. "Wish I spoke Japanese, there's a name on this sword I can't make out."

"And where are you going to put the katana?!" Katie asked. "Over the mantle?!"

"No, no," Harry said. "The fireplace is connected to the Floo Network. That's where the steel-toothed bear trap is."

"Harry...sweetie..." Katie said. "Husband...you're acting a little bit overboard with all these safety measures, don't you think?"

"I don't want to take any chances," Harry said. "I want to keep you safe..."

"And that's very sweet of you..." Katie said. "But what about..."

"YAAAAH!"

"Oh," Harry said. "That would be the trap I set for journalists..."

"Harry..." Katie said. "Please tell me you didn't just trap Luna."

--------------

"Luna, I am so, so, so, so sorry," Katie said. "And Harry's sorry too!"

Luna was bound from neck to ankles with rope, dangling by her toes from the chandelier. A dozen swords were positioned so that if she were to move so much as an inch in any direction, she'd be cut into pieces.

"I do not mind that much," Luna said dreamily. "This is a far more interesting death trap than the one I accidentally triggered in Peru."

"And what were you doing in Peru?"

"Looking for a Swooping Neet-eagle," Luna said. "But there was nothing to bind me in that tomb. Just a very large boulder that was far too perfectly round that chased me."

"Hold still, Luna," Harry said. "I'll get you down..."

"Take all the time you desire," Luna said. "It's not often I get to dangle upside down--there weren't many trees suitable for dangling by my knees on the grounds of Hogwarts, don't you know. But if you could vanish the swords..."

"Not vanishing," Harry said. "But I'll set them aside...let's see, here's the gladius and the rapier and the scimitar and the claymore and the falchion and the two dao and the saber and the gari and the dha and the urumi..."

Katie watched the growing pile of swords with an increasingly aghast expression. She glanced back up at Harry.

"And there we go...that's the last of them," Harry said, sheathing a cutlass. "And Luna...hold still and I'll get you down. Oy, I said hold still!"

"Harry!" Luna squealed. "I have to say, this tickles very much. You'd be better off to just...ah ha ha!"

Luna broke into an absolute fit of giggles, even though Harry was no longer even trying to undo the knots tying her toes to the chandelier.

"Er..."

Katie pulled her wand out and summoned the loveseat. She flicked her wand again and Luna dropped from the chandelier onto the small couch.

"Oh, thank you Katie," Luna said. "This is most comfortable."

"Harry," Katie said. "We need to talk..."

"I understand your frustration," Luna piped up. "But Harry was only doing this because he wants to protect you. And his measures will protect the baby as well."

"Baby?" Harry blurted. "Wait, what baby?"

"Er..." Katie said.
