True story time. So I was reading Temptation on the Warfront, right? And then it got to the part where Remus was talking about Draco's time in the Order's custody. I said, aloud, "Oh, ta gueule Remus, you blood bastard." I think my stars every day that nobody else was in the room when this happened. Like, I didn't mean to say something so rude(I know I could've been more like "Taisez-vous, s'il vous pla√Æt" but it's much longer and doesn't really fit the context. and at the time, I had completely forgotten the existence of 'Tais-toi' which I probably should've used at it's much less crass than ta gueule.) But the point is, I curse a lot in French. Like, a lot. I'm also very crude in French. Most people I know don't speak French and so it's a great alternative. You should've heard what I said about that one guy's mother... edit: please tell me I got the spelling right. I had to search google for how to get the specific letters and kept getting butchered by autocorrect.
