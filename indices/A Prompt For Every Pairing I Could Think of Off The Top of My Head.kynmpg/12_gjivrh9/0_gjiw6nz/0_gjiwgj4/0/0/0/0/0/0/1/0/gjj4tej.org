The Basilisk one reminds me of Drop Dead Gorgeous. It's a drarry fic. I can just imagine Draco from that fic verse saying 'Je suis parfois fou' because, to be totally honest, he's a bit crazy. More than a bit crazy. But, like, in a good way. I definitely recommend the fic, though.

Also, an add on to my comment, I'm adopted. So, while my Mimi's maiden name is French(I get so annoyed when others mispronounce it. It's pronounced like fairy-ay), my blood is a salad of European.
