Here's a few

Ron/Padma : Their Yule Ball actually goes fucking awesomely and they hit it off.

Ron/Michael C : Turns out Ron had ulterior reasons for being mad at Ginny dating him

Ron/Cho : Crack fic where Cho works through her grief via passionate debates about Quidditch teams. Harry in shambles

Alternatively all three plus Luna and Terry in the story of how Ron accidentally got a Ravenclaw harem
