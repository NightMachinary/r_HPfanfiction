I'm pretty sure that Ron started dating Lavender because he was sad-mad after a combination of Ginny mocking his lack of romantic experience, missing out on going to the Slug Club with Hermione because he badmouthed it, and then Hermione ranting at him for cheating at Quidditch when it turned out he hadn't. Lavender was available, and interested, and helped his self confidence to recover.
