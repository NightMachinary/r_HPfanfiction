Actually she made an unprovoked and violent attack. If his relationship really wasn't anything to do with her, there's no particular reason for him to focus on her having kissed Viktor Krum. He should have said something about how he's not interested in Hermione and doesn't have to be in a relationship with her if he doesn't want to, but he never said anything about how he felt or didn't feel about her. That's telling IMO. He was hurting and not over her. And he never talked about that with Lavender; they didn't talk much at all. So it wasn't resolved.
