Because I wrote this at 2:00 AM. I mean quite literally that this was the list I came up with off the top of my head. I like Ron, but I don't read that many fics that focus on him in a romantic relationship.

I never thought Ron and Lavender's relationship was for spite. I just thought they tried it, and it didn't work out. It would be cool to do it. I will add a prompt for it.

McGonagall being hot could be believable. You're just seeing a younger her. Cute? No way in hell. I'm talking taking it to the max.
