Professor McGonagall was definitely not supposed to be hot :D. At least, her students were never supposed to think of her in that way.

However, I can't help but notice that you've almost completely shafted Ron. What about Ron and Lavender talking through the reasons they didn't work out and trying again? Or better yet, starting their relationship the first time around for better reasons than spiting Hermione and Ginny?
