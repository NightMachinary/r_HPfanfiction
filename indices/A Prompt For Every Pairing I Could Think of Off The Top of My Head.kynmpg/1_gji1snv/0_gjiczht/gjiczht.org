If looks could kill.... everything would be as it should be. But it wasn't.

The Basilisk was feeling extremely annoyed. Her first master and father died and left her all alone. Her second master left her for fifty years without any warning and came back to act like a jerk. Her newest master seems nicer, but she was let down before too many times, so when he got pulled away by that stuck up bird, she decided to follow him. A bit of ancient and confusing magic later and she was on the surface, bipedal. And her master was getting crowded by sniveling humans instead of being with her, and no matter how much she glared at them they would NOT DIE!!
