SeriousScribble's /Unatoned/ fits this perfectly. 103k words, complete, and reads like a noir or a hardboiled work. It's on ffnet. Has a brief Astoria/Harry scene, but is mostly Daphne/Harry (it's not multi). Daphne isn't you're standard Ice Queen. This Daphne is colder than the Bellatrix from Delenda Est.
