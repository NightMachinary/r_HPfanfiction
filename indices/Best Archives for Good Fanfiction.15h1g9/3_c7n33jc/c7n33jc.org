If you are looking for a specific pairing (especially the more rare ones), then I'd suggest going to the livejournal community for it. (Just google the pairing "(name x name) livejournal" and usually something will come up). I've found some really amazing fanfics that way!

Otherwise I just use the big sites that are listed in the sidebar, mostly fanfiction.net since it is so big.

If you trying to find really high quality fics, I'd look at someone's favorite fanfic recommendation list (many livejournal people do that, plus some on other sites like tumblr, etc). If you find someone with similar tastes, you can find tons of high quality stuff. Fanfiction.net also has some communities dedicated to high-quality fics. I don't think there is an entire site dedicated to only high quality fanfics though (since that would be really hard to judge of course, we all have different standards).
