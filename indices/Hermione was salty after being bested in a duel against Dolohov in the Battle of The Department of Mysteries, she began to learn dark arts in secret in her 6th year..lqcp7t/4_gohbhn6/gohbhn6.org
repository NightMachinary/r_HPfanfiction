"turning dark"... so... becoming a more interesting character?

idk. if she doesn't go evil, makes sense to me. it's already clear in DH that she and Ron would sacrifice their lives to make sure harry has a chance.

would the best time for her to learn all this stuff be during sixth year? or maybe while they're hiding in grimmauld place in DH.

alternative timeline: hermione becomes obsessed w the unforgivable curses after cedric is thoughtlessly avada-d and her first boyf gets imperiused -- long before she is submitted to torture herself, because she is hella empathetic like that. and she aims to understand as much as she can about dark curses (which of course involves mastery of the curses themselves)
