I think a lot of people consider that Harry used the Cruciatus curse without the necessary hatred and will to cause harm, yet the curse still worked to knock down bellatrix. So that could be taken that the curse itself had some purpose (medically to do with nerves?) and was only when someone used it intentionally to do harm that it was discovered how horrible said curse was.
