Yeah, no. The Unforgivables require extremely specific emotional states - Hatred, Dominion and Cruelty - and I don't see them used in the medical field or really anywhere except by dark wizards.

Like, the Cruciatus requires you to want someone be hurt unimaginably hard /without reason/, the Imperius curse requires you to want to divest all free will someone possesses, and the Killing Curse requires you to mean death for no other reason than pure hatred, and all three cause damage or corruption to your soul.
