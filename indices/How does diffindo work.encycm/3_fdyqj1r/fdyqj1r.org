Yes, the famous Cutting Curse in so many fan fictions is in my opinion a pure fanon, and it doesn't really exist. Whether the Severing Charm is better for cutting textile (although Harry broke ice with it, true), or whether it could and whether it is used as a weapon, there is no answer for it in canon. My hunch is that there is something like that (the first reason for any invention is to use it as a weapon or for sex), but I don't think the Severing Charm is it.
