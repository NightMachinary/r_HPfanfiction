In GoF Ron uses it to attempt to cut off lace from his robes, leaving them a mess. Harry uses it to cut a strap on Cedric's bag (from something of a distance), and later to cut off the cover of a book. To me these sound like using scissors, and in Ron's case, not particularly sharp ones.

Of course, spells are pretty flexible, and can be used in different ways and in varying levels of power, depending on the caster's abilities - see for example Harry using the Severing Charm to break ice in DH.

But for the spell's "default" behaviour, I'd lean towards "like scissors".
