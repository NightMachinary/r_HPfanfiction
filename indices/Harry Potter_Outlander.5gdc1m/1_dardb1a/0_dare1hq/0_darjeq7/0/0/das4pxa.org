I haven't seen all of GoT (as I read the books), but what I did see I can definitely agree.

I LOVE costumes in period dramas. It's one of my favourite parts of watching shows from different periods. There's a yellow dress in season 2 of Outlander that was on some promotional photos (I think), and I have consistently gone back to look at it and admire all of the tiny little details.

EDIT: [[https://strongfemalefriendship.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/outlander-02.jpg?w=863][The Dress]] I mentioned above.

Also, just as a side-note about the show... it's surprisingly decent. I mean, it's an adaptation of a romance novel, but I wouldn't compare it to a Harlequinn romance. I'd definitely recommend giving it a try.
