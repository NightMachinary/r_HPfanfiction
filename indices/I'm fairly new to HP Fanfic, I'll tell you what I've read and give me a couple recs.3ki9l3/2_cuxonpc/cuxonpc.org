A bit of advice, don't limit yourself to only completed fics. There are a ton of really good fanfics aren't completed and probably won't ever be.

With that said, linkffn(6256154), time travel without the whole go back to Hogwarts.

Linkffn(8233288), has some Ron and others bashing which is too bad but still a good story, kind of a Lord Potter story in a way.

Linkffn(3384712), not super sayan Harry but he's still pretty powerful, really good fight scenes.
