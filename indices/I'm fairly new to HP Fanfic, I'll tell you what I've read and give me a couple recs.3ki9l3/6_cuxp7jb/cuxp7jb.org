All H/Hr or unpaired, because that's most of what I've read. I try to avoid anything that self-consciously "bashes" anything else.

/With Malice Aforethought/: One of the better canon-style sixth-year fics I've read, though it rushes to the conclusion a little faster than it ought to. linkffn(With Malice Aforethought)

/Harry Potter and the Last Horcrux/ and /Harry Potter and the Years of Rebellion/: Great dialogue, world building, characterization, writing---basically everything except concision. /Years of Rebellion/ embodies a lot of what eventually became "Independent Harry" cliches, but it does them extremely well. It's unfinished and will probably never be finished, but the space from the start of the thing to Hogwarts is the size of most fanfics and filled with action and novelty.

/The Last Horcrux/ is much more disciplined and dark (and completed); the second half wanders a little, and I could do without the goblin subplot, but it's fun to watch a good writer wander. They're both on [[http://fp.fanficauthors.net][Fanfic Authors]].

/The Golden Age/ is an extremely bizarre, unsettling, and convincing story, which I think is all I can say about it without giving anything away. linkffn(3682339)
