Here's a list of oneshots that I really recommend you read, as well as a few longer stories that I think you'd like.

These stories are all short, but they're all good and they should give you an idea of the breadth of options there are. I didn't discover some types of fanfiction until several months after I started reading, and this should let you avoid that mistake.

The Lie I've Lived is by a writer who's now a published author, and has a powerful yet believable Harry. It's not Harry/Hermione, but the romance sub-plot isn't that large and meshes nicely with the main storyline. It's in first-person, but the writing is very high-quality and it's reminiscent of canon.

Runemaster has a few minor plot holes, but it's much more of a classic Powerful!Harry story. I think you'd enjoy it a lot, based on the stories you mentioned earlier.
