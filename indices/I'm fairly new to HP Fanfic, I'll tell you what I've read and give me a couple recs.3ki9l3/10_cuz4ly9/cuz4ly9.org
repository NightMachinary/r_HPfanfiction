I like stories involving Ginny as a main character, because I always feel that she's a great, but underdeveloped character in the books. Here are some of my favorite Ginny stories:

Elemental Harry, linkffn(5648259)

Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince, linkffn(5677867)

In the Heat of the Night, linkffn(11367427)

The Promise series, linkffn(9104885;9666944;10212593;10623014)

The World As We Knew It (and its variation), linkffn(3571753;3872862)
