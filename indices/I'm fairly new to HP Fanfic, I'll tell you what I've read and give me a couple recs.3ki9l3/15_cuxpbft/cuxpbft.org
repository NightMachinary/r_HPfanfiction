A few H/Hr stories for you:

Linkffn(Harry Crow by robst) - Robst is not thought highly of around here, because his writing is super trope-y, but if you like that, then he's for you. I recommended this one because Harry is powerful, but his other stories also have soul bonds, time travel, etc.

Bobmin at fanficauthors.net has a great super!Harry duet called Sunset over Britain and Sunrise over Britain. However, there is definitely Ron!bashing. Seriously, great story, but just assume Ron was replaced by an evil pod person.

I love linkffn(Notebooks and Letters by chemprof). He also has some other great H/Hr stories.

Linkffn(The End and the Beginning by muggledad) is inspired by NOFP but prevents the creepy relationship by bringing Hermione back as well.
