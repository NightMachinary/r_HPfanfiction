I have always visualised Winky as a miniature Weasley in temperament, a redhead ... she will just go and tell Crouch what he needs to hear and =$DEITY= try to stop her! So, just the opposite, in her rage, while shouting at Crouch, she by mistake kicks the homunculus in the magical equivalent of the garbage disposal. That's the end of the feared Dark Lord by a lowly house-elf.
