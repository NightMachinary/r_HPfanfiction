Circular Reasoning is a well-written fic, but it's so depressing that I wasn't able to finish it. I am quite fond of Post-War fics though. There are a lot of them floating around. I don't mind non-explicit Slash, and I found these to be awesome stories:

The Most Powerful Magic ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2457953/chapters/5448869]])

Anachronism ([[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/snarry_games/252197.html]])

Both are well-written and explore unusual magic and mysteries. There's no explicit slash in TMPM and very little in Anachronism. The latter is amazing and I recommend it highly; just have an open mind and try them.
