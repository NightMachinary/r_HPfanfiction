  Heather Carlisle grew up with busy parents and a sister that's always been at her side for schemes and mischief. The two girls were shut away in their great aunt's summer home when they got their Hogwarts letters. At fourteen the two are broken out by a group called the Order of the Phoenix and Heather is told she's Harriet Potter,the girl who lived. But she's not sure how she feels about the Order's leader- Albus Dumbledore.
