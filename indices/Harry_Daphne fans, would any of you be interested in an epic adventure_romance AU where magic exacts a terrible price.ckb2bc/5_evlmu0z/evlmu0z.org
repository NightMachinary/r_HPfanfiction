I for one would like a fanfic where magic is even more powerful and a sense of wonder and terror is prominent regarding magic. Fuck magic having a price to use. Make the real danger come from people. Raise competence and danger of people in general. Have multiple groups vying for power and control (and actually be relevant) besides Dumbledore, the Ministry and Voldemort & co.

You want a grittier take on the world? Do it through the people. Leave the magic as it was or make it more awesome.
