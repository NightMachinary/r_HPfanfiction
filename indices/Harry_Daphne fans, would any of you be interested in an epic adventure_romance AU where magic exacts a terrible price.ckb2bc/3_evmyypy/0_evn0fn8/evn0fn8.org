I don't mean that every little magical action will have major consequences but there are two lines from ASOIAF that intrigue me: 1) Magic is like a sword without a hilt; there is no safe way to use it, and 2) Prophecy is like a treacherous woman...she'll bite your prick off every time.

Again, not every magical moment would have consequences and I don't intend to exactly copy anything, but the idea of magic costing something interests me. That and compelling characters facing moral and philosophical dilemmas.
