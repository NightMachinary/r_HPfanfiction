2 months late here but I just saw this and remembered the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense]] series, where (fem) Harry gathers A LOT of knowledge beyond her peers, for many reasons explained in-story, and Tom Riddle keeps trying to convince her of how similar they are. Very AU, crossover/fusion with the Song of the Lioness books.
