This story is in no way a Harry/Hermione pairing, that said it is rather rair in that it does depict Harry dating people before finding someone he loves. Something I personally find far more realistic than him marrying his first crush. Keep in mind the length of this story, it is almost as long as Atlas Shrugged so little things in the first chapter likely aren't a very good indication of any overarching plot. It is very much a slow burn and is also the reason for my OTP.
