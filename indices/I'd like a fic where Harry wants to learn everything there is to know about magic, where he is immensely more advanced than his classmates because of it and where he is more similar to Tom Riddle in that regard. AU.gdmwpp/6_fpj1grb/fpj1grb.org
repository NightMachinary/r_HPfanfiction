There's always HPMOR, where Harry is literally a clone of Tom Riddle. I recommend starting at [[https://www.hpmor.com/chapter/5][chapter five]], you don't miss much and that's where the author starts to hit his stride. This fic is controversial since Harry here is pretty full of himself, though that does come back to bite him.
