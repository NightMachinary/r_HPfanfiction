I disagree: the tragedy is exactly the same. Looking at your claim from a different way, it's the same as saying, "it would be less tragic if only they chose the correct child to mistreat".

I do understand your point of view, but for me it rather detracts from the tragedy and cheapens it with the implication that the BWL somehow deserves care more.
