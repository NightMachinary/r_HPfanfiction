Say, the two bothers are Harry and John.

When considering these two:

1. James and Lily thought John was the BWL, and so cast Harry away to focus on John. They were wrong, and Harry was the BWL.
2. James and Lily thought John was the BWL, and so cast Harry away to focus on John. They were correct.

I maintain that both cases are equally tragic, and in both cases their actions are equally reprehensible.

However, more subjectively, I feel like many fics (sure, not all) use the "they were wrong" part as if it makes the situation more reprehensible.

Though I'm kind of confused which point of mine you're arguing.
