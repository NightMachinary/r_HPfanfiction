But that's why it's tragic. They cared more about the prophecy child, and less about Harry. Harry just wanted their love in a good deal of these stories, not to be loved more, but just loved.

Sure there's implication from James, and Lily, but that's not Harry's doing. I don't mind these stories if done right, and Harry just wants/wanted their love. Hell most stories have him disliking his parents anyway, and he's disgusted when they want him back purely, because he's the BWL. I don't know what stories your reading, but my type of stories have Harry hating that behaviour, not revelling in it.
