While I couldn't do it myself and I don't like it, I can see how the neglect of Harry in this fic could happen. He doesn't get sent to the Dursleys.

The question of who, exactly, is the boy who lived remains ambiguous iirc. A bash-free WBWL, that, while a bit rough at first and could've used a beta, is still a great read.
