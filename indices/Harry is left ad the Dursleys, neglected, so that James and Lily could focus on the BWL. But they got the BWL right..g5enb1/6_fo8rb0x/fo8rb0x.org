Some thoughts I had:

Harry turns up at Hogwarts' Sorting. His brother, who knows that he had a brother but didn't know anything more because he wasn't spoken of at all, is astounded, as are their parents.\\
Unsurprisingly, Harry is apathetic at best, bitter at worst about being cast away, considered a squib or not, and pretty much wants nothing to do with his birth-family.

Plot direction #1:

One of his brother's friends has a crush on Harry, and wants his brother to try to hook them up. His brother likes the idea, since it'd mean he'd be in his circle of friends. Unfortunately, Harry is already dating someone, and this perceived interference strains things even more.

Plot direction #2:

Harry does his own thing and pretty much remains distant from his birth-family and their attempts of reconnecting. He's genuinely not interested.\\
His last conversation with them, their real final attempt to reconnect with him, ended up with him heatedly calling them a bunch of c*nts in their Seventh Year.\\
Years later, Harry is working in the DoM as an unspeakable, is married to the love of his life, and life is going well.

He ends up being a magical version of Indiana Jones with his wife, recovering old artifacts, smashing dark cults, et cetera.

His brother, in the meanwhile, is an auror -- and is pretty much kept on safe duties. His life is unfulfilling and uninteresting, and it's /killing/ him.

When he's roped into the latest hijinks and is forced to be involved in one of his estranged brother's misadventures, he can't help but feel envious.

Lily and James are surprised and saddened to find out that their second son is married and that they're grandparents, and that they never knew.

Best revenge is living well, after all... even if it was unintentional revenge on Harry's part.
