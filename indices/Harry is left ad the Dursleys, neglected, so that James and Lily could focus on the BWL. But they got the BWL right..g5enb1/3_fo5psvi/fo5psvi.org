I've noticed this kind of thing a lot in fics and it's been bothering me lately. The Daily Prophet slandering people without evidence and facing no confidence is terrible when it's happening to Harry but when he buys the paper and does the same thing to his enemies its alright. Lucius and a few "dark" families controlling the Wizengamont to push their political agenda is a travesty but Harry claiming 10 Lordships and doing it is righteous.

Obviously their motives for abusing the system are different and Harry is doing to better society but rarely does he do any kind of work to actually fight monopolies and corruption.
