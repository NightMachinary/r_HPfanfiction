Agreed. I'd be interested in any story where Harry is not the BWL. Whether it's Neville, or Harry's sibling, or there is no BWL. It's strange that every story like that is actually a WBWL story where it ends up being Harry after all. I think you're right that the WBWL aspect detracts from the poor treatment of Harry.
