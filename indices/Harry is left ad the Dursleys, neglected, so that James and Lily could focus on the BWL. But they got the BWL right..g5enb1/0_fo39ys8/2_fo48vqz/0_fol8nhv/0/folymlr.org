Well Harry dies and is reborn on the 31st of July when he is six years old. A traumatic event essentially kills the old Harry and a new Harry capable of defeating Voldemort is born in his place. Without that traumatic event killing who Harry is in a way he never would have become Charon. It makes a lot of sense when you read it and actually seems possible. He isn't the boy who lived because he didn't survive the killing curse but he is still the chosen one.
