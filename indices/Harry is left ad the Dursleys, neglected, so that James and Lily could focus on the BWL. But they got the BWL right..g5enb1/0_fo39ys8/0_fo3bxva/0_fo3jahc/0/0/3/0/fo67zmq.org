  And now someone please tell me why squibs cannot attend Hogwarts, but like... a valid reason.

Because when the Pureblood movement got going in the 17th century, one of their chief tenets was that if you couldn't use a wand, you weren't a /real/ mage, so all the brewers and rune-carvers and beastmasters and astronomers and arithmancers and diviners and alchemists who had hitherto done at least a couple of years at Hogwarts at the part of the school Helga Hufflepuff used to run - she was a firm believer in the proposition that your hedge-practitioners were just as valid as the fancy-dan wand-wavers - were left high and dry.

All that talent fucked off to the muggle world, and as a result the magical world got stagnation while the muggles got the Enlightenment.
