And now someone please tell me why squibs cannot attend Hogwarts, but like... a valid reason.

If they wanted to go, they could still use theory, brew potions, care for plants and magical creatures. No problem with Astronomy, History of Magic, Arithmancy, Divination, Muggle Studies, Ancient Runes. None of those require casting I think and even if any of them would for any reason require a spell here and there - it still could be solved.

Whyyyy.
