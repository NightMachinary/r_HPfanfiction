How do you figure? I know what JKR said or wrote, but it doesn't really tell us all that much. I think there could be a solution, but seeing as we really don't know the particulars of potion making, it's difficult to address the problem.

So I guess it depends on how you imagine this process to go down and how you work with/around the information you have, isn't it?
