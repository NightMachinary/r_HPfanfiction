Even the squib route wouldn't work on its own. It'd need the squib route + something else, IMO - a murder attempt, a specific thing said by someone they trust, etc. And even then, I still struggle to see them not wanting to take a look at Harry again.

It seems impossible to really make work, at least with them satisfyingly abandoning him. Feels like a kidnapping or something forced would work better instead?
