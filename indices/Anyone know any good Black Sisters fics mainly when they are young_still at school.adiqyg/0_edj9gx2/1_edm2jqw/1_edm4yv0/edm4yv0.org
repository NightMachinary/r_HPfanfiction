Well, Lucius and Narcissa have sex while he's an adult and she's a minor in If Your Father Knew, and I do remember there's lots if sex in Early Days; can't recall if Narcissa is actually seventeen at the time, but I think she's a 5th year. I wanted to be on the safe side as far the rule about minors having sex goes.

I really do love Early Days, though I wished it was a bit longer and that the resolution hadn't been so easy. I felt like Lucius needed to earn it more. But I loved his parents in it! Forsaken Love is a good story, but it's also pretty miserable. I don't know if I could read it again without becoming depressed. I much prefer Early Days. Because I haven't read it in a long time, I honestly can't remember if Narcissa was a minor when she marries Lucius, so I played it safe.
