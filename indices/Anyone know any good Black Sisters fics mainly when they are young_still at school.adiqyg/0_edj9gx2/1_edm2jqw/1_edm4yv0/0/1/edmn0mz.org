I skipped Yarrow. Is it any good? I was afraid that it was going to be as depressing as Forsaken Love, with Lucius perhaps still in love with his dead wife.

I think I did read that alternative ending. I guess I just wanted to fic to be longer and more developed. That conflict was so good and it rang so true that Lucius would do something that selfish, but I wanted him to grow up a little and truly earn her forgiveness, even if he did so during the relationship. I think it was okay that she went back to him, but maybe he should have also had to show her that she could truly trust him before they got married.

If you love Lucissa, you should check out [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17220164][charcoal and salt]]. It's a quick one-shot, but it does have a Narcissa that is closer to my head-cannon than anything else I've ever read.
