I know quite a few Narcissa ones, with Bella and Andie as side characters, but due to Reddit rules I can't post them here. Look for Early Days and Forsaken Love by fairmaidofkent, which are two very different Lucissa fics (though Lucius is in character as being sort of a jerk in both). Forsaken Love though extends into their marriage and gets quite depressing. If Only Your Father Knew by TechnicolourGrey is an AU with Lucius's as Narcissa's (and Bella's) DACA teacher. I tend not to like fics that treat the pureblood families as so old-fashioned they start marrying off their kids as soon as they hit puberty, so there haven't been many memorable fics for me, but I'm sure there are tons.
