There is an ongoing fic called Broken Reflections that has Harry back in time , falling in love with Andromeda and getting all chummy with Narcissa- Bella has not made an appearance yet, but Harry is planning to save her from becoming mad and it is promising:

​

The author has other fics with Andromeda and Harry, so check out their summaries to see if you are interested_ usually, there is a fair amount of Andromeda-Narcissa interactions, and reminescences of Bella.

​

I also like A true daughter of the Black, mostly Andromeda-Harry and you get Narcissa as well:
