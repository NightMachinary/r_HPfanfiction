Well, I don't think she might have disliked him exactly (though in my head-cannon she sometimes has a little disdain for that side of the family), but that the age difference was too huge for Sirius and Regulus to be anything but the babies in the family. Narcissa is five years older than Sirius---she would have been in NEWTs classes by the time he got to Hogwarts, and probably married and running her own life by the time his opinions solidified and he left the family. I can't imagine they hung out in any real way. I find that fics that change everyone's age so they are all age-peers can be a bit of a cop out. Either the author can make it so Narcissa is friends with Severus and/or rival to Lilian and not really bother creating OC characters that are meaningful, or they insert Sirius into Narcissa's and Andromeda's lives in way that seem to be more about the author liking Sirius than anything. I believe they might have been protective of him, but I doubt they saw him as a fried or someone Andromeda could talk to about Ted. I'm sure there are all sorts of good reasons to make those changes and good plots that can come from the family being closer, I just haven't come across any that was really strong. Mostly, it just feels like people want to write Sirius as a significant character when they do Black Family fics and it's hard to do that when he's ten.
