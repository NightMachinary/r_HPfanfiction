i like the idea at somepoint when they were younger that the blacksisters were fond of there little cousin Sirius...before he became friends to blood traitors mubloods and became a gryffindor lol i can buy Narcissa over Bellatrix as she only really cares about Narcissa in canon but get a sense Narcissa has soem compassion and tenderness...deep down maybe ahha
