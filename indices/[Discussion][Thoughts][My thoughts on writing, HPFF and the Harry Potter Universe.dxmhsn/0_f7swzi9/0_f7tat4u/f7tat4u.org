OP deleted his comment responding to your post before I got to make my reply. So... here it is anyway.

I think you're confusing "common sense" with "my own views" - which, ironically, is rather against the nominal spirit of Methods of Rationality (though very much in keeping with its actual content).

For example, for me the common sense position is that if Dumbledore didn't place Harry with the Dursleys, Harry has a happy childhood... until he is murdered around age 8.

It's all about how you choose to engage with the material - constructively or destructively.

The constructive approach engages with canon in good faith, seeking to preserve what has been established and, where necessary, proposing canon-compatible constructive solutions to problems which cannot be avoided.

The destructive approach engages with canon in bad faith, seeking to find problems where there didn't need to be any, /hoping/ to find contradictions, with the aim of destroying as much as possible.

There are a lot of people in the fandom who conflate the destructive approach with common sense, rationality, etc. But it's not. It's a deliberate decision.

Easy example: Unbreakable Vows.

Here is an item in canon which present questions such as: why are vows not used much more widely? Couldn't they be used by people to prove they are telling the truth? Couldn't they be used by the Ministry to create a perfectly lawful society? Couldn't they be used by Voldemort to create a perfectly loyal following?

The /constructive/ approach to canon observes the fact that vows are not used much more widely, and therefore seeks to answer these questions in the negative in a reasonable way which makes sense when viewed in line with the rest of canon.

It proposes answers like:

- Perhaps the Unbreakable Vow can only be used to swear to perform actions, and cannot apply to words/statements.

- Perhaps the wizarding population has strong views about the limits of government and view compulsory vows as unacceptable.

- Perhaps Unbreakable Vows cannot be used for broad concepts like loyalty/betrayal but rather have to be specifically worded, and so it would be impossible to envisage every possible means of betrayal.

- Perhaps Voldemort believes that if word got out that he demands unbreakable vows from all his followers, people would stop joining him altogether.

All of these ideas are compatible with canon, and seek to answer questions as to why canon is the way it is in a way that preserves the status quo of how canon works in a reasonable fashion.

The /destructive/ approach, on the other hand, looks at things like this:

- Maybe wizards are so stupid that they haven't thought of these incredibly obvious ideas.

- Unbreakable Vows in canon doesn't work, so let's just say that Unbreakable Vows don't exist.

The common feature of the destructive approach is that it seeks to dramatically change canon as presented. The first of the ideas above inevitably leads to the single intelligent wizard in the world (usually a super!Hermione) exploiting her "discovery". The latter changes the world by removing a piece of magic which was a key part of the plot of HBP.

To be blunt, your own approach seems like more of the destructive than constructive approach.
