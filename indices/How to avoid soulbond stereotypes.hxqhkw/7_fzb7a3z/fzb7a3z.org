What annoys me the most is the idea of two (or more) people being made in a way as to perfectly complete each other. It goes against free-will and disregards entirely that people can change, the fact that one person can get along with other while they are 16 don't mean they will get along at 20, or 40 or any other age really.

If you feel that you absolutely must do a soul-bond my advice is to not make it permanent if it is romantic, just something like being so in tune with each other that their souls interact, this way it can be a slow process of two people getting closer for it to happen and then end when they grow apart.

If it isn't used in a romantic context there are some more possibilities, like twins managing to feel each other and knowing if the other is alright or not or even people choosing to make a soul-bond, like aurors using it to be better in sync with each other.

Other than that I guess the best advice is don't make it Harry/Voldemort, the Horcrux forming a soul-bond with is kind of annoying. Hell, cross-generation in general would be unwise.
