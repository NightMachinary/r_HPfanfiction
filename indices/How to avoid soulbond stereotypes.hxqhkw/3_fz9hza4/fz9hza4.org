Stupid little idea I got but Double Soul Bond.

For simplicity sake, let's use the character of Ginny, and the events of the CoS since they are already there from canon, though it could work with any character.

In the days following the destruction of the diary, Harry and Ginny remark that something changed in them, they both can feel a strange, foreign feeling in them. After some research, they discover that they can in fact "feel" each other. This connection does not seem dangerous, and they can easily discern the foreign feeling from their own, so they don't about it to anyone else (fear or being strange).

With time, they discover that this connection is in fact more complex than they first thought. Usually, they can only have a sense of each other mood, but, when one of them feel a very deep emotion (both of happiness, anger or distress), this connection can also transmit sounds and images. In the train leading them to Hogwarts in PoA, Ginny can also hear a woman scream, and during the 1st Hogwarts Week End, she can see herself yell at Ron and Hermione even though she is in her Common Room.

Because of these events, they both decide that they have to learn more about this connection (if only to not peep at each other secrets). After spending a lot of time trying to control their mind (unknowingly learning the bases of Occlumency), they manage to control their connection, being able to ease it or cutting it off. They even manage to "talk" to each other through it. They use it daily and become very close, being each other confident.

Then, Voldemort comes back and the heros understand something, they were never directly connected. While sucking his life force, a little part of the diary soul went into her. With the destruction of its vessel, the soul was stuck in her mind and was too weak to do anything to her. Yet, this soul shard was still connected to Voldemort, just like the Scarecrux of Harry was. All of their previous connections used Voldemort as a relay.\\
Now knowing the dangers of this soul bond, Harry and Ginny try to cut all contact off, but all habits die hard.
