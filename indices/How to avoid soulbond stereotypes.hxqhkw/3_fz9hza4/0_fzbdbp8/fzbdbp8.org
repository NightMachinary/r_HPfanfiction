Would be funny as hell if it made Voldemort be forced to hear/feel everything they passed to each other (important info about the enemy is one thing, two children's inane chat though would drive him even madder). OrHarry and Ginny together actively using the bond with Voldemort at the intersection while having some rudimentary and knowledge of occlumency -of the trial and error variety- have a deeper effect on him, maybe the dementors affect him because of Harry, or their combined love for Quadrich transmit making him have random bouts of obsession (in fact, new HC, Voldemort didn't know how to fly broomless previously to â€˜81, he only invented it because Harry's love of flying rubbed off on him), or even Ginny's feelings of disgust for the diary ends passing to him making him eventually regret making Horcruxies.
