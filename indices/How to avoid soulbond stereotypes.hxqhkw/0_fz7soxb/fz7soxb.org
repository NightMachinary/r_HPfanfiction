Don't be paedophile (or don't make your readers ones) ... the fact they are soul-bond doesn't mean they should sleep with each other at thirteen, and people don't date at twelve (“Ginny, thirteen years old, had an orgasm.” from one story which shall not be named here). Let them be natural and for the first couple of years they can be just awesome friends, who in appropriate time decide that she is a girl and he is a boy, and they should do something about it, and some couple of years more they can decide on sex and/or marriage. There is something awesome about just pure friendship, and sex doesn't have to be rushed on the top of it.

Don't go overboard with the closeness unless you really meant it ... either you write linkffn(Error of Soul by Materia-Blade) or you don't, but if you don't, don't make them completely integrated, that's just the uncanny valley for you.
