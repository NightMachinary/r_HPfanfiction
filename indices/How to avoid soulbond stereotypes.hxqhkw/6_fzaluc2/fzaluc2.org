I don't think that it should necessarily mean they fall in love. I read a fic where Harry and Draco have a soil bond but it was completely non romantic, for the most part, the only time Harry's personal relationship comes up odds on the epilogue. Ask it meant was that they knew when the other was in trouble and they had the same abilities, i.e. both parselmouths etc. However weird if warning: Voldemort memories and strange sequences Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3655940/1/]])
