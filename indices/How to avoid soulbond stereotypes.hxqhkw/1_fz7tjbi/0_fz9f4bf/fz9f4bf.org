  It's Ginny who can feel Harry's emotions, it's Ginny who feels the pain when Harry gets hurt, it's Ginny who has to be nearby Harry most of the time. But Harry doesn't have to do any of those things.

So . . . just like Harry with Voldemort?

Now that I think about it, Harry's situation in canon could be used for Soul Bonds. Vague sense of each other feeling, and some "visions" when one feel a very deep emotion.
