I mean, it's not really the soulbond trope that comes with these cliches, more like the author already wanted to write these cliches and uses soulbond as an easy tool for it.

But onto the real suggestions:

-Don't make them able to automatically read each other's thoughts. Just don't. It's going to suck no matter how you want to write it. Maybe they can learn it later by working on it and developing their unique communication channel. But it shouldn't be automatic.

-Make it more like they can feel other's /emotions,/ and that too, vaguely.

-Them having to be in the near vicinity of each other isn't a bad trope. Just don't go to the extreme with it. They don't have to be in touching distance. Just being in the same house would be enough. They can even be very further apart, just not for a long period of time. And for god's sake no "X amount of sex is required in X period of time".

-A twist that I've personally never seen. Make the bond one-sided. Like, say, because it was Harry that saved Ginny from certain death, Ginny's soul is literally anchored to Harry, but not the other way around. So, Ginny's life is ENTIRELY dependent on Harry. It's Ginny who can feel Harry's emotions, it's Ginny who feels the pain when Harry gets hurt, it's Ginny who has to be nearby Harry most of the time. But Harry doesn't have to do any of those things. That's ripe for drama. Just imagine Harry's self-sacrificing and kind of reckless nature. Well, he can't put himself in grave danger at a moment's notice because there's Ginny's life to consider. What would he do when he realizes he himself is a Horcrux and has to die?
