I'm personally taking a different then traditional approach to soulbonds. I really don't like the idea of traditional trope soulbonds, because it makes the romance feel empty and frankly quite creepy. Like an enforced marriage contract, but it also changes you to fit each other.

Basically, I have soulbonds as something that isn't completely natural, but rather forms off a traditional (and barely legal) wizarding marriage ceremony. The couple getting married exchanges a part of their souls, which gets assimilated by the rest, but it doesn't work for every couple. It's like a spectrum of compatibility, for example, Voldemort and Bellatrix gain a decent awareness of the other and some traits from each other, with Voldemort gaining a bit of emotion off Bella, while Bella becomes a parselmouth and gains a clearer mind. On the other hand, a pairing of complete opposites, for example, canon Harry and canon Draco, would react violently and potentially permanently damage both of them due to how ridiculously different they are - like pouring oil into water and somehow forcing the two to mix.

I feel like this cuts down on the creepy aspect while still keeping the "destined lovers" aspect, as you're not /forced/ to be with one person, but you still know when you find the right one for you.
