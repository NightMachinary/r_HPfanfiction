*On the Egyptian border* - Clarkson's car

"Right as you can see James has been pulled over by some men in robes, and it looks like he's been questioned. I bet he's regretting buying such a cheap car now. And he's being arrested and his car is being taken away. Oh look, he's calling after the car. I guess we'll see if he's released in time to continue the challenge tomorrow."

*The next day*

"As you can see, I was released after a long night of being questioned. Apparently, the previous owner used some experimental government technology without permission and they needed to track the car down to ensure that it didn't fall into the wrong hands. I had to sign an NDA with a quill where I promised that I wouldn't let anyone outside my family into the car, or inspect it. They also gave me a customs exemption certificate, and I need to bring it in for servicing every 3 years. They were even nice enough to repair Angie's bodywork after the mean men damaged it trying to take it off. Yes, you were a good car, when we get home you can get a paint job of your choice. Yes, yes I know you're excited, but you can't go yet we need to get our destination with the other two."
