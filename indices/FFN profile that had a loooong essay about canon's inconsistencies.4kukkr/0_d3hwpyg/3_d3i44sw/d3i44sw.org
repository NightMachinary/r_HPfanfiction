That is a long read and I'm barely a quarter way through it. But what I read does bring up some great points.

I think the reason I like reading and writing Dumbledore/Weasley bashing fics is because of the plotholes and inconsistencies they bring up and turn into storylines. They're really fun if you don't take it too seriously. For example, I usually write these because I like to parody inconsistencies.
