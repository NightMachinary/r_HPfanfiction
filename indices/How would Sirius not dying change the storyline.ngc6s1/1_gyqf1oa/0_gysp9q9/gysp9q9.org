Given Kreacher helped to make the whole Ministry thing happen (he injured Buckbeak and then used that to trick Harry into believing Sirius actually /was/ being tortured) on Narcissa's orders, do you really think Sirius would keep him around?

It's a small detail in your post, but I don't think Kreacher would still be around after pretty much /actively betraying/ Sirius. At best, Sirius would get a different house-elf - I could see him hiring Dobby, for example.
