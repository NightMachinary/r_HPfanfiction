  As I said, if Sirius doesn't die, then what's rhe point of making the Ministry thing about Kreacher?
#+end_quote

It's how it canonically is, so therefore it is the "default" to argue from. Of course, the author is free to make it happen any other way - but then we're not asking the same question anymore. "What if Sirius survived in an AU where the Ministry Battle either didn't happen, or happened for a different reason" is a vastly different question to "What if Sirius survived the Ministry Battle".

  And the locket was in the house after sirius moved away, and Sirius doesn't care about family heirlooms, he probably wouldn't pay attention.
#+end_quote

There's a difference between "I give a shit about family heirlooms so I recognize this as not being one" and "I've seen this /very specific design of locket/ in the old family home I've been confined to for a year with not much better to do".

  And it's important for Kreacher to stay around because Sirius has a biased view about his brother. Sirius would never know the truth about Regulus.

Is this /important/ though, or is it just something /you'd/ want to see? I'd argue the latter, given we don't actually know what the author of the fanfic wants with it. If they're fine with leaving Regulus out-of-focus and developing Sirius's character in other ways, that's their good right.

From a realistic point-of-view, a /lot/ of family issues never get the resolution they could have, and people take their issues to the grave. This bit of character growth is not something that /needs/ to happen in order for the story to have a logical conclusion, just something that you /want/ to see because it makes for positive character development.
