As I said, if Sirius doesn't die, then what's rhe point of making the Ministry thing about Kreacher?

And the locket was in the house after sirius moved away, and Sirius doesn't care about family heirlooms, he probably wouldn't pay attention.

And it's important for Kreacher to stay around because Sirius has a biased view about his brother. Sirius would never know the truth about Regulus.
