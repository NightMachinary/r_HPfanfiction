Sirius can just as easily fill in the required blanks - RAB was his brother, "that fake locket looks familiar..."

And I'm not sure Harry would actually stop him - he was perfectly willing to hand Pettigrew over to his actual worst fear, to have what he knows is a Fate Worse Than Death.

He also reacted /really badly/ to hearing what Kreacher did in canon. While I think his reaction would be more tempered than if Sirius had died, I think he'd be willing to just walk out of the room and let Sirius do whatever he wants to do.
