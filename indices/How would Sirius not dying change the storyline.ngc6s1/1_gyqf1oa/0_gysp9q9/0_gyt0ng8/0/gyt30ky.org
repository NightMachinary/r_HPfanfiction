Note that Kreacher didn't /know/ Sirius was going to die. He was essentially just doing something /because Sirius wouldn't want him to, but never ordered him not to/. Sirius's death was an added bonus of sorts. Even if Sirius doesn't die, all else being equal, Kreacher would still have done what he did.

Given he was already acting on Narcissa's orders, the security risk is there regardless of keeping or firing him - plus, memory charms are a thing. Obliviate, sock, done.

Although, who said anything about freeing? For all his good parts, Sirius is pretty... Unstable. I think he'd just as soon put Kreacher's head with the other decapitated house-elves.
