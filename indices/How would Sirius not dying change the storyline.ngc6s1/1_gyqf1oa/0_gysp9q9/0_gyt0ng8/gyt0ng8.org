Yeah but if Sirius doesn't die then what's the point of having Kreacher betray him ? And Sirius can't get rid of Kreacher since he knows too much. No matter how much he threatens him, freeing him would only mean more problems for the Order. Why do you think Harry didn't free Kreacher then and there when he learned he became his Master ? OP could find another way of making the Ministry thing happen.
