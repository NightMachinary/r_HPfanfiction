Mundungus would have never robbed Grimmauld Place and the Horcrux would still be there. Since they woudln't need to infiltrate the Ministry, Yaxley wouldn't break the Fidelius Charm, so they would be able to stay at Grimmauld Place the whole time and have full cooked meals from Kreacher, so less arguments. Since they wouldn't need to constantly take turns to wear the Locket Ron wouldn't go away. Etc etc.
