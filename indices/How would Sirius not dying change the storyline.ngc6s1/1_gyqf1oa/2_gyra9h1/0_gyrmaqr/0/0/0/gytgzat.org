Yeah that fits better than what I thought. Although getting it through the sorting hat would have been easier it wouldn't have set things up for Ron's heroic return to the trio in the books.

I know summoning it at will is a fanon rather than cannon thing but it does make more sense to me that if the summoner has previously shown those traits and is in a situation where he has need of the sword to help him again that it would be able to be called like that.

Sort of like being proved worthy like Thor, Cap and his hammer.
