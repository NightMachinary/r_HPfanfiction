Authors keeping him dead isn't necessarily because it's the “easy way out” so they don't have to do tons of planning to change the storyline. There are certainly reasons that doing so may make the most sense for a story or someone's character development, particularly Harry's. Losing Sirius - the only parental figure he had - was part of his development in the original books and contributed to the person he became.

If someone is just going follow the same storyline just because it's easier than planning out changes that make sense based on the history they've created, then people are better off reading the actual books.
