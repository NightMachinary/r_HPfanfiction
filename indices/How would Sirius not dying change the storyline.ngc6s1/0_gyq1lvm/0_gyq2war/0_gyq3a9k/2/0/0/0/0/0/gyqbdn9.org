Oh I didn't mean to bash any author for being lazy if that's how it came off, some just said they were too caught up in school to do so but they still came up with amazing plots

I didn't really catch on what character development Harry might've gotten from his death. It's been a long while since I've read the second half of the series. I know he became more scared of loosing everyone because of it but that's about all I caught on to. So please if you can elaborate just a bit that would be awesome.

The thing is he already has an emotional crutch in this story so I'm not really sure if Sirius' fate is essential to my plot line for character development as I'll be throwing all sorts of stuff at them.
