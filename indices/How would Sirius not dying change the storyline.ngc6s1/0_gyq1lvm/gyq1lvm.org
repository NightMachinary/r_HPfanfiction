Sirius not dying means Harry is less depressed when he hears the Prophecy, Tonks keeps her original Patronus, and Sirius without a doubt goes with the Trio on the Horcrux Hunt. Lupin wanted to but Harry was like "stop being a dick you have a pregnant wife go back to her now" but Sirius wouldn't have any reason to be tied down. Would maybe be able to make the Break-in at Gringotts easier. Would (maybe) know Fiendfyre for destroying the Horcruxes.

Though if they took your Fem OC with them too, 4 teens and a Dog solving a Case? It's the Famous Five, Wizarding style.
