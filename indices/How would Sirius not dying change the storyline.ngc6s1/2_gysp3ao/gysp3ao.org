I think:

- Harry would be /far/ less depressed in the summer between fifth and sixth year.
- Sirius would /definitely/ know R.A.B. were his brother's initials, making the search for the Real Locket a lot quicker.
- Fletcher would not have the opportunity to steal the locket, much less sell it, with Sirius being there.
- Fairly sure that Kreacher, given he acted on Narcissa's orders to make the whole Ministry Fiasco happen, would no longer work at Grimmauld Place - whether by the giving of clothes (plus an Obliviation) or by death.
- I'm actually not sure if Sirius would have access to Bellatrix's vault. Logic dictates he wouldn't - but he'd want in on that plan regardless.
- In fact, I think he'd want to be there for /most/ of the action.
- Instead of the Camping Trip From Hell, they'd retain Grimmauld Place as a relatively safe base of operations.
