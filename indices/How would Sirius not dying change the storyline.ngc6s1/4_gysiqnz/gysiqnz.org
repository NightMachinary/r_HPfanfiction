I would love to have authors use Sirius more.

He could stay in Britain, instead of leaving like he did. There are Polyjuice potions he could take and other potions/magic he could use, where he wouldn't look like himself.

Or even using muggle hair dye or different colored eye contacts, etc, could potentially work. Hermione or someone else could mention it.

Sirius could help the kids when they are looking for the Horcruxes, if you do have Sirius going somewhere during that time frame, he'd know how to escape people and be able to help them.

It sucks that Sirius was forced to stay at his hated childhood home, being around his screaming portrait of a mother, and his house elf didn't help matters. No idea where Remus lived, but I wish he had stayed with Remus instead.

I wish Sirius had told Harry how to use the two way mirror. It feels like such a cheap writing tactic used by Rowling, not have Sirius explain how to use it, Harry doesn't think to use it, and then finds it and feels awful about his death all over again.

Sirius gets caught in the DOM, Albus steps in and demands a fair trial. With Voldemort being revealed to have come back, people are more prone to listen to Albus, Sirius gets a trial and it's revealed he was innocent the whole time.

Harry also wouldn't be so depressed when he finally learns about the Prophecy.
