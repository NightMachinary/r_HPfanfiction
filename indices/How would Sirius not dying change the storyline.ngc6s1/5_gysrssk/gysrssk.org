Does Sirius die at the veil?

x Yes, canon.

x No, then how do the Aurors react?

x x With curses - Sirius dead, possibly blamed for the whole thing, Harry now hates Ministry. It's mutual.

x x With cool heads - Sirius gets his trial. How healthy is he?

x x x Not very much, the Azkaban and the stress of being locked up at Grimmuald means the healers do not want to release him ( Sirius gone for period of one year to Longbottom stint)

x x x Decent enough. Harry can live with Sirius, which leads to a much happier Harry. Even if Dumbledore wants him to live at Privet, at least Sirius can move in next door, or even be a good dog.
