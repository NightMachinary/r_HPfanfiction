Imagine for ex, that the pureblood culture is for example not considering magic as a tool but a way of life, pagan rituals, not following the muggle religion. Noble customs if you want to add it. Family magics. And of course, dark magic being accepted. There is some depth to the pureblood ideology despite the racism. There is more to Voldemort cause that racism. One only has to take into account that Voldemort himself is a half-blood. No the situation is more complex that black and white. Because if it was Black and White : then simply put the Slytherin House at Hogwarts should have been disbanded and never reformed. Families in their entirety killed or imprisoned to Azkaban until the terrorist indeology was rooted out .

And Harry would have ample motivation to wish to become more wizard like because of the animals he was entrusted with by Dumbledore.
