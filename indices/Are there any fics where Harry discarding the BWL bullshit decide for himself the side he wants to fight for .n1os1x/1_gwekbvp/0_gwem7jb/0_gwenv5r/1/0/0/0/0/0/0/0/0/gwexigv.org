Fucked up certainly , FUBAR I don't think so. Who in the sheep that is Wizarding Britain would believe him. The Great Albus Dumbledore is for muggles, he cannot make mistakes. It is Riddle speaking against the Great Dumbledore. Dumbledore only has to reveal that Riddle was in a muggle orphanage and no one will believe him after that. Why Fudge never used the full might of the Ministry against Dumbledore ? Because the public opinion would be against it. One word from Dumbledore was enough for Snape to escape prosecution. Secondly he could not tell it before being of age, because as Fudge and Dumbledore explained it no one believes children. Even more so if their are not celebrity or an heir to a rich estate.
