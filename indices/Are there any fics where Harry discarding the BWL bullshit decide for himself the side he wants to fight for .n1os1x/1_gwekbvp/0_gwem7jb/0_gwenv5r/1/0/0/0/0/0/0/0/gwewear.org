Uh, Riddle creates Horcrux with his completely unrepentant murder at the age of 15. I'd say he's already fucked up beyond belief even before the Horcrux. And it still doesn't explain *why Riddle doesn't tell anyone about Muggle endangering Wizards*.

If he knows that /before/ summoning Salazar's Monster, then it means he decided the solution is to unleash a murderous monster to a school full of children and some of the most skilled wizards and witches, so a wizarding world without their literal and figurative future somehow will be able to defeat the Muggle?

And if he knows that /after/ rendered insane, then this is just an asspull. "Oh yes, he literally murdered babies. It's all for a good reason tho. No he can't tell you, he's insane, just roll with it".
