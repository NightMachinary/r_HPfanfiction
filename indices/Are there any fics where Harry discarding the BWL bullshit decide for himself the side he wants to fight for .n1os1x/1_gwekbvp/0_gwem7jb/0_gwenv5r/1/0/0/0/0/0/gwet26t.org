And the Dark Eaters doesn't tell that to everyone during their reign because....? It would be as simple as taking a trip to a pensieve memory watching the seer making the prophecy, or even without any hard evidence, just say it out loud, "hey, we /know/ Muggles are going to eradicate us". Instead, all they did is claiming Muggles are inferior subspecies capable of stealing magic to justify the purge of Muggleborns.

For the purebloods to have any sensible reason to entice Harry to cross to the other side, this would be a very diverged AU, assuming Riddle is aware of this, he can just warn everyone who will listen, including Slughorn with his various contacts, instead of going killing people for reasons. That would be like knowing for sure a minority group in your country is involved in a conspiracy, but instead of bringing the evidence or at least stating the reason to the public, you just start killing them.
