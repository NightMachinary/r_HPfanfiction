The Slytherin House isn't always a dumpster fire of pureblood supremacist, Slughorn himself is shown to have at worst patronizing attitude about Lily and Hermione being highly talented muggles, but he still openly praise them and likely would've used his contacts to help their career had the war didn't happen.

The pureblood supremacist doesn't really have much in canon aside from hating Muggleborns. Salazar Slytherin disagrees about accepting Muggleborns to Hogwarts, so unless the Muggleborns managed to find a sympathetic magical to help them at least controlling their magic, they're as good as dead.

The resistance radio specifically said

about the murder of a Muggle family. There's nothing "deep" about the pureblood ideology, the average Muggle is completely harmless to a wizard, and would never know anything about the wizarding world unless they have a Muggleborn in the family or marry a magical. If they have /anything/ else to their goal, their reign wouldn't be so full of murdering and torturing Muggles.
