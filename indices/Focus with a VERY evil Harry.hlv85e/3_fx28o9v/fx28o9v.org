linkffn(liquida tenebris) is a really messed up fic, I won't spoil it too much, but Voldemort is Voldemort and Harry just forgives him for all he's ever done because apparently Dumbledore manipulated him into killing his parents. Like, you can't ignore that he still killed them and loads of other people!

Yeah, I'm really pissed off about that.
