Glamour Charms are fanon.

Usually, they can be undone by a powerful enough Finite, but Polyjuice can only be reversed by the Goblin waterfall, as far as we know.

If you are imitating someone, then it's better to use Polyjuice potion, because things like exact skin shade are hard to recreate on another person.

And, as the glamour charm seems to be an enchantment to change one's external appearance in fanfiction, the cheekbones, nose and chin will stay the same, unless you are applying Transfiguration on top of the glamours.

Human Transfiguration is hard, so a wizard with average abilities is likely to avoid using it, less he damages the airway trying to change the structure of his nose (does it even work like that?).

Also, the tell-tale signs of Glamour charms, applied by wizards inexperienced in this field of magic, are slight blurriness and smudged features.

The glamours are usually used when one doesn't want to be recognised by every passersby and doesn't particularly care that the application of glamours is obvious. It is better to use glamour charms than to brew polyjuice for a month(?), all for a single walk around Diagon.

All of the information above is what fanfiction authors use the glamour charms most often as, and it is likely I'll do so too, as it is more or less an established piece of fanon.
