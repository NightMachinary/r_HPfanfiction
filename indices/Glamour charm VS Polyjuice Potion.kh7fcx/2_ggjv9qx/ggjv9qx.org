Like [[/u/InquisitorCOC]] said, glamour charms are fanon. However, canon does have other forms of altering your appearance. The best example is Hermione disguising Ron for the Gringotts break-in:

#+begin_quote
  It was just possible to discern Ron under his disguise, but only, Harry thought, because he knew him so well. Ron's hair was now long and wavy; he had a thick brown beard and mustache, no freckles, a short, broad nose, and heavy eyebrows.

Hermione's teeth growing and shrinking and Harry regrowing his hair via accidental magic are other examples that come to mind.

So why use polyjuice instead?

The biggest reason is, like you said, because polyjuice is much better at making you look exactly like a specific person.

The magic might be too hard to be practical. Yes, brewing polyjuice is also hard, but it can also be bought or made in bulk by a competent brewer and stored for later use. If you want to transfigure a disguise, you need someone good at the magic right then.

Related to the previous point, it's probably a lot easier for something to go wrong when transfiguring someone. With polyjuice, the worst that can happen is that you grab an animal hair, but that should be pretty easy to avoid if you're careful. And while magically altering hair is pretty harmless, I'd be very reluctant to let anyone adjust my eyes or bone structure or anything else important, because any mistakes could easily have serious repercussions.

Finally, it's harder to be sure you look different enough. In the quote above, Harry could still barely make out Ron after Hermione's changes. Admittedly, it helped that he knew he was looking at Ron, but there is clearly still a higher risk of discovery than with polyjuice, especially it you're trying to hide from people who know you well. And not everyone is as thorough as Hermione, especially if you're disguising yourself.
