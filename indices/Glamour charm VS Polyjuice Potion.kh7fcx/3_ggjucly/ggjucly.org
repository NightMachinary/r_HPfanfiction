  Is the glamour charm even a real charm? Or was it made up for fanfiction?

It's made up.

That said,Tonks mentions acing a Concealment and Disguise exam of some sort that she had to take as part of joining the Aurors, which she attributes to being a Metamorphmagus. So there /do/ exist spells that can serve a similar function of "make a person look like someone else," but the implication is that they're rather difficult to perform. (Or perhaps difficult to perform to Auror standard, or maybe they're easy to detect or dispel and the real difficulty is blocking /that,/ or something else. Point is, it's not something most people can do.)
