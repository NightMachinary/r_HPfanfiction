The absolute friggin worst. “I realize I haven't updated this fic in ten years, but my grandmother died and then my dog died and after that my computer died. Plus, I was studying super hard for exams at Uni and I burst a blood vessel behind my left eye which resulted in a temporary inability to use the language portion of my brain. So, I'm really really really sorry, peeps! But now I'm back!” I feel like I'm reading their excuses for not turning in their homework and it's all bullshit.
