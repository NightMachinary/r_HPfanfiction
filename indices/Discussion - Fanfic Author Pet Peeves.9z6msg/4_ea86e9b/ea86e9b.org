Anything longer than two or three sentences before or after new chapters. Plus, I don't really need to read the disclaimer more than once per story. And stop replying to comments in those spaces - I haven't read the comment in question, I won't read it, and if I find myself interested in some sort of discussion about plot points or whatever, I write a comment of my own, read others or search for some sort of discussion platform the author uses.

​

Also, some people use ridiculous strings to separate scenes. Since I tend to have my pc or tablet read ff to me while I am busy with household chores, it's very irritating when the computer voice suddenly starts to repeat strange acronyms or random characters ad nauseam. I don't mind using some stuff to make a scene separation clear, but I think just a couple minuses or something similarly short is enough.

​

Oh, and another pet peeve: Long explanations about the authors private life. Even if I do read a story before it's completed, and there has been a long break, I prefer a short "Sorry, had IRL stuff come up" or "sorry, next chapter(s) will be delayed" to something lengthy which just distracts me from the story. I've enough trouble happen in my own life, I don't to borrow someone else's.
