Disclaimers do not have any legal meaning. If the original creator would want to sue you, he'd simply do so. I understand that Rowling is in fact fine with fanfictions as long as they do not have adult content (sex).\\
So, at least for Harry Potter, writing a disclaimer that you do not own it, is unnecessary.
