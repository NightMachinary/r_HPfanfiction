Disclaimers like that were kind of A Thing when a lot of Bobmin's fanfiction was written. Most of his big stuff was 8-10+ years ago (jesus christ that makes me feel old).

And a lot of older fics did the answering reviews thing in the AN's because they literally *couldn't* just message the reviewer to answer their questions or whatever.
