Actually what's in the fic is not what I am talking about, I am talking about things that Authors do at the beginning and end of chapters (and sometimes in) when they make notes that they think are cute, Spending the first page of a 3 page chapter 'arguing' with their characters as a disclaimer or answering reviews at the end of a chapter. Or putting (ha ha) in the chapter as if the character looks at you the read and snickers before going back into the story. Those kinds of annoying things.

A prime example is Bobmin's disclaimers that are moronic and are usually two pages long, while his chapters were fairly long, the disclaimers really dumbed down the story sometimes.
