Lots of authors have annoying things they do with names. Like the constant use of insulting nicknames even when it doesn't fit the story (e.g. a super political fic that has Harry referring to Umbridge as Umbitch in front of the full Wizengamot), random switching between first and last names, having every adult ask small children to call them by their first name as soon as they meet them, etc. Getting stuff like this wrong really can harm the flow of a story. Naming conventions should be consistent within the story and with the tone and theme.
