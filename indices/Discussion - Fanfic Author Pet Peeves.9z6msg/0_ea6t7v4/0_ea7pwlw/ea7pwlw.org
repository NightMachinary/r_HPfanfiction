I do a thing where, depending on the situation between the characters, I'll use either first or last name in a scene. For example, in class, I'll use ‘Professor McGonagall' or ‘Professor Snape' or ‘The Headmaster/Professor Dumbledore'. If it's outside of class in certain settings, for example when a character is friends with their Professor or former professor and they go for tea, they would use the first name. It's consistent, but changes with circumstances. Not really explained very well either. Don't judge me.
