As long as naming conventions are internally consistent with the situation and storytype I'm completely fine. Using nicknames or some term of abuse in certain fics is fine. I expect it to happen in a crackfic. And if you have established certain relationships within your story it's fine to use first names (although in my opinion the ease at which professors and other adults ask kids to call them by their firstnames is entirely unrealistic).

But I've seen fics where there is no established (friendly) relationship between Draco Malfoy and Harry, but he still refers to him as Draco while referring to other classmates (that are closer to him than Draco) by their surnames. That's inconsistency that annoys me greatly.
