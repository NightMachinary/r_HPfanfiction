I haven't seen stories like this mainly because realistically it would never happen, in the series Harry has been shown to not fear death at all, it's one of the reasons he becomes the master of death. Death is seen as a release for him, he gets to see his family and friends again, compare that to Voldemort who feared death and tried to prevent it. Albus is another character who didn't fear death, he viewed it as the next great adventure. It's why Stories where he makes a horcrux is hard to swallow.

Also harry wouldn't kill a person just to stave off death, he has a very strong moral compass and it's one of the things that makes harry who he is.
