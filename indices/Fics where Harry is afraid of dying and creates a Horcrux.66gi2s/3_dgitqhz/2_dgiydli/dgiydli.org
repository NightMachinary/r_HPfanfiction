Not too sure about that, realistically, Harry SHOULD have feared death as for him it's just another thing he can't control, just like his entire life, just like where he goes and what he does, he always has to be everyone's errand boy. I think if he didn't fear death he would still hold a great amount of animosity towards it for how many people it has taken from him.
