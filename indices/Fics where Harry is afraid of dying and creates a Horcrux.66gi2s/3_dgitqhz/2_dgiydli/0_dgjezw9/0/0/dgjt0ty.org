Harry was never 'Everyones errand boy'. Harry didn't have much respect for authority, though there were plenty of authority figures he respected. Harry always did his own thing guided by his strong set of morals.

If you want to write a fic about Harry who is completely OC you could. But don't pretend canon has anything to do with it.
