Hypothetically, some purebloods believe that the greater harm comes from leaving magical children to be raised by muggles.

The following metaphor is not perfect, but I think some purebloods would agree with it; a child is born with perfectly functional legs. His parents, grandparents, siblings, pediatricians, teachers, classmates, neighbors, literally everybody else in the entire world, as far as the child knows, were not born with legs, and get around via wheelchair. The kid is popped in a wheelchair from birth. His classmates call him a freak for having weird, gangly growths off his pelvis. His parents freak out at him everytime he tried to use his legs. At best, they might be trying to keep him from hurting himself with those bizarre, gangly growths. At worst, they are disgusted and ashamed of having given birth to him, and just want him to be "normal". His pediatricians raise the possibility of corrective surgery, to remove the bizarre, gangly growths. He needs a custom-built wheelchair to accommodate the growths. Then, when he turns eleven, his family suddenly learns that those medieval myths of people born with legs were true. There's actually an entire reclusive city of people born with legs, and an entire school that teaches children parkour, gymnastics, dancing, and marathon training. The city loves athletics competitions, and there's a new competition every week. The parents are pursuaded, by any means necessary, to allow their kid to go to the school. Now, the kid has been stuffed into a wheelchair his whole life, and his legs have atrophied. He will need to go to a hospital to repair the damage, and he might never reach the level of his classmates at the new school.

This metaphor is filled with problems, but I think it's accurate to how some purebloods would see it, at least the purebloods who would be inclined to "rescue" muggleborns instead of exclude them.
