While I know what you're looking for, I'd like to point out in canon it wasn't quite as blatant as all that. He held Neville out the window to scare him, he never intended to drop him. He dropped him by accident, and because it's meant to be a whimsically funny tale, he got distracted by macarons. Or macraroons. Can't remember which.
