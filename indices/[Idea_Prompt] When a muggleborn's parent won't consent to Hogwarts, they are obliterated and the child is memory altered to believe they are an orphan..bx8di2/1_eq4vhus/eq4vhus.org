"Luna, why are you dragging me inside the classroom?" Harry asked. He had just met her on the train, and she seemed nice enough, but with Voldemort back one never knew.

"Don't worry, Harry. I'm trying to help you."

As soon as he sat down at a desk, he turned around to demand when Luna said, "Sorry Harry, this had to be done. /Obliviate/!"

He woke up to find two women and an old man arguing at the end of his bed. By the looks of it, He was in some hospital, probably. Why was his head hurting so badly?

The old man noticed him awake, and quickly gave him water to drink. He promptly sat up and complied.

"How are you feeling, child?"

"Head... hurts."

"Poppy? Do give him a Pepper-Up, will you?"

"You know I can't wh---"

"I have to insist, Ms Pomfrey."

She huffed. "Very well. I /will/ be putting this in his official records."

"Do what you must."

She huffed again, but reached into a cupboard and pulled out what the old man had called a 'pepper-up.'

"Drink this, my dear," she said kindly.

Since he didn't see any malice from the group, he shrugged. Why not? The headache was killing him as is, a poison might finish the job faster.

He gulped it down, and immediately the pain was gone. He looked the weirdly shaped bottle in wonder. If he had this all the time the bullies had beaten him...

"What do you remember, boy?" the old man asked.

He tried and tried, but he couldn't remember how he got to this hospital.

"Uh, I... don't know, sir. I can't remember anything."

"What is the last thing you remember?" The lady who had remained quiet for a while now spoke.

"A bunch of boys chasing me? I don't know. My head feels whoozy."

"What else?"

He tried, but nothing came to his mind.

"I don't even remember my name!" He shouted, panicking.

"Calm down. We are here to help you."

The boy didn't calm down at all.

"I don't know my bloody name! Who am I? How did I got here?"

The old man waved a stick at him, and he instantly felt very calm and peaceful, almost as if all his emotions were being suppressed.

"Do you know my name?"

"Indeed I do, Tom Marvalo Riddle."

Damn I love the idea. If anyone likes, feel free to expand upon this.
