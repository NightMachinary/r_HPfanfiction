Okay I'll just be honest and see what you think about this pairing: I was going to write Sirius/Hermione post-war. She would be of age, I wasn't going to write smut, and it was going to be a very slow burn. And Sirius was never in any “power” over Hermione. I created a plot line in which it would be very believable (or so I think) that they might end up together, but it's a rare-pair and I'm not really sure what people think about it. What are your thoughts?
