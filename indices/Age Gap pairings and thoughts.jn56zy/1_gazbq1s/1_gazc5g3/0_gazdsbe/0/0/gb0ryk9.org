I get what you mean. It would actually be post-war and it's a Voldemort Wins/Harry dies AU. So it's dark, and there's a lot of reasons I'm seeing them end up together, particularly after the death of Harry. She'll be of age and no grooming or anything will be involved. I didn't know it was common, I don't see many stories with this pairing. But I see what you mean. That's partially why I made this a post-war/non Harry story, because I think having him around would make things very very weird. Maybe that's me taking the easy way out as an author though, I don't know.
