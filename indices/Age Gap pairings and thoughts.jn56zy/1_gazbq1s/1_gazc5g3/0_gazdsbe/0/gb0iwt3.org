Yeah, this is a pet peeve of mine. Like, I'd be completely freaked out if a parental figure starts fucking my best friend. It's creepy. That'd be the end of two relationships for me pretty quickly and yet Hermione/Sirius and Hermione/Remus are super common. It doesn't help this is often paired with a tiny bit of Harry or Ron bashing to explain why Sirius fucking Harry's best friend is totally cool and really it's Harry who's the asshole.

That said - if she's not underage or was being groomed for sex as a school kid then whatever. This also isn't really a rare-pair, it's fairly common.
