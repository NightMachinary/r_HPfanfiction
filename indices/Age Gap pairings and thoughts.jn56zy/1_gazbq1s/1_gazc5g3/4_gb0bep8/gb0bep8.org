To give you my personal opinion, I'd never read such a story, but not because of the pairing - rather experience has taught me that Hermione centric stories annoy the fuck out of me.

The fact that you can't please everyone is an important life lesson to internalize.

So go for it and don't give the haters any consideration. If you get negative reviews about the premise, delete them without a second thought. Life is too short to worry about random trolls on the internet think.
