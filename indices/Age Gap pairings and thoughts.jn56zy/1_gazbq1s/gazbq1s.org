People tend to find age gap pairings messed up if the older one is/was in a position of power over the younger or the younger is underage. It also gets a bit gross if the older person knew the younger as a child and there's a creepy "I was waiting for you to be old enough" undertone.

Remus/Nymphadora pretty much everyone's okay with because she was going into her mid twenties and met Remus at that age.

These are very safe rules to go by, and if you can't change the story to make them work, and you have a different idea, maybe just move on because there will be some backlash.
