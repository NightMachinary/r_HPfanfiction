Well I've never posted anything before, so I'm nervous to begin with. And it's not just that I care too much about people's opinions, I don't want to be seen as morally wrong, you know what I mean? If it were anything else I wouldn't care at all, but because people have strong opinions about this particular issue, I guess I'm really nervous about posting it.
