I am able to speak, and I don't think I am stupid for thinking it's problematic that a grown man spending hours and hours every week, living in the same building as a little boy, watching him grow up, go through puberty, then a year after the boy turns legal seducing him.

That's pretty much textbook grooming. There is no possible way to write a character doing what I described and /not/ have him be a predator. Which, whatever - if you're into reading fics where the molester is the protagonist, that's not illegal. But I'm certainly within my own rights to call stories like that gross.

Edit: also, saying that because "he didn't groom him in canon, it's okay" doesn't really make any sense, given Snape died in canon and Harry hated him, plus Harry had a girlfriend. If a fic has Harry/Snape plowing each other, that's by definition AU. And if Snape was Harry's teacher, in that AU Snape is def a predator.
