A gap by itself isn't the problem. It is a function of younger vs older. The difference between a 16 yo and an 18 yo is vast. Between 20 and 22, also vast. The vastness is often severely underestimated by those around that age...

If you have a large age gap, you have to age it up if you want to present the relationship as appropriate. There's always wiggle room, but I think half plus seven is normally a good rule. I don't have a problem with writing an inappropriate relationship, but you'll be fairly accused of finding an inappropriate relationship appropriate if you write it as if it were.

I'm not of the thinking that art has to be appropriate or moral. Hell, murder is common. Just be clear with yourself where the boundaries are. If you're writing underage and you aren't aware that you're crossing a line, it will come through in the writing and you will be rightly criticized.

Just like every 'rule' for writing. You should really only be breaking rules when you're aware of them. Also don't forget, relationships matter as well. Let's say it's Hermione/Remus. His relationship as her teacher at a young age ups the ick factor significantly.

Sorry for the rant. Don't be afraid of criticism. Jump into it. There's nothing wrong with breaking a rule, being criticized for it, and learning from it.
