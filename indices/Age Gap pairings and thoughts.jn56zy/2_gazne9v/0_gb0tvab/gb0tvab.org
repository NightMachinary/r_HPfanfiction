This is fantastic. Thank you very much for this insightful post. Yeah I'm not writing this age gap relationship to say that this is the end-all be-all for what relationships should look like. It's almost the opposite. My pairing takes place in a dark, Voldemort wins AU. These two, due to lots of things, are emotionally broken. So I'm writing the pairing trying to grapple with life together, not to say “look at these two, they're doing great so therefore age gaps are perfectly acceptable”. No. I'm writing the two together because of who they are as people, what they've gone through, and the similarities I see between them. You've definitely encouraged me. Thank you!!!
