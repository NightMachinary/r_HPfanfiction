This is sadly a fact of life in the fandom at the moment.

However, there will always be those who judge stories unfairly based on applying their own expectations, sight-unseen. Just as there are those who say that 'all fanfiction is crap smut written by degenerates' without ever having actually explored the fandom outside of a few of highly visible 'memefics' there are those who will immediately label age-gaps in much the same way.

The perspective is understandable. Fiction has a power to normalise things. Usually this is beneficial, for example in the representation of homosexual or trans people who usually get short thrift in conventional published fiction. Fanfic has, I am sure, helped a great many people come to terms with who they are, by seeing that they are /not/ freaks of nature, but part of a global community with shared experiences. However, that normalising power is occasionally cited by moral crusaders as being a bad thing when combined with 'problematic' or 'troublesome' ideas.

In the 90s, the Shawshank Redemption was released to cinemas, based on a novella by Stephen King. It received a significant amount of criticism due to its humanising portrayal of incarcerated criminals. Today, it is typically listed among the greatest and most important movies of all time. /Not/ because it is apologising for people who committed murder, or theft or any other crime, but because it reminds us that, whatever their actions, those things are part of the human experience. Whether we like it or not, these things happen and, contrary to what we'd like to think, being a convicted criminal does not make someone /all/ evil. Similarly, those who are /not/ convicted criminals are /not/ all good.

The world exists and shades of grey, and Fiction, be it in the form of movies or books, should serve to paint a picture of the world in all its shades. Lolita is a deeply troubling novel, but its worth in increasing a reader's understanding of how the human condition can lead to such worrying thoughts and actions cannot be denied.

I do not want to suggest that age-gap pairings (or, as many of the those who feel them to be immoral might say, paedophilic pairings) are something we as a society will 'grow out of disliking', in the same way much of society has grown out of the blanket demonization of criminals. Nor do I want to imply that age-gap pairings are equivalent to Lolita, as by no means do all age-gap pairings involve relationships which are quite so troubling to the general populace.

All I am saying is that it is not the job of fiction to define what the human condition is and can be. Fiction is merely meant to describe it. All its curves and its edges; all its heady peaks and lowly troughs, the good and the bad, the dark and the light. It is only through understanding of who we (collective 'we') are as humans, and what we all can be, or be seen to be, that we each can individually grow into the people we all wish to be. And if we are to do that, we must see it all. We must see that which we believe to be bad so that we do not lose sight of the fact that we all are on the same journey. But for a few missed wrong turns, I could perhaps have been Red, or Humbert Humbert.

This is all a very long-winded way of saying that you should write whatever it is that is in you to write. Write that story, and post it. Add to the sum of what humans are and can be, and do not back down.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

(This was entirely more answer than I expect you, or anyone wanted, and it's just going to disappear along with this post as the age-gap drama continues to go back and forth, but oh well. C'est la vie.)
