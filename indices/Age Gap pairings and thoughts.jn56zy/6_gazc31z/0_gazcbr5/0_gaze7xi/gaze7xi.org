You are, only because you could take months and try and figure out the exact combination of characters and relationships that won't offend anyone and still get some asshole trolling you on your first chapter. As a writer, people are going to criticize your writing no matter what - write something you are proud of and don't worry overmuch about what people on the internet think. Not to mention your writing is naturally going to be better writing about characters and relationships you're interested in, rather than trying to adapt to other people's preferences.
