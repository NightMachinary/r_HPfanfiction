Thank you, this is really solid advice. I really want to write this, and I know people write a lot of age gap pairings for Snarry, Snape/Hermione, etc. So I don't know why I'm so nervous about mine (I'll just go ahead and say it, it's eventual Sirius/Hermione). I could easily transform it into Sirius being a mentor rather than a romantic partner as the whole fic will have a found family vibe. but I just saw it as a romance. I guess I want it to be kudosed and commented on (what author doesn't?), but I have a couple options I think. Either write what I want to write, or use one of my other ideas for a more popular pairing
