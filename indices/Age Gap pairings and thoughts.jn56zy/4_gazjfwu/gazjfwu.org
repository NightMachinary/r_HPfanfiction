Tumbler groups tend to magnify radical or extreme ideas, and shouldn't be given much authority to influence what you write.

Rough rule - every character in a relationship needs to either be of age, or under age. You can't mix, unless your plot is literally about the problems that causes.

As long as every one is of age, go for it. Some folk won't like what you write, but that's always going to be the case. Some folk may even be offended, but that will always be the case no matter what you write.

The most important rule is to write what you want to write, screw the haters.
