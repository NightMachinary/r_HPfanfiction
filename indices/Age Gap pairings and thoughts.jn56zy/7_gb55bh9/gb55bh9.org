It depends. Are they all 18+ age wise? And are all parties involved aware of age difference? Because I read a hermione/grindlewald fic a while back and it wasn't creepy or icky The age gap thing comes into play typically when the age of consent isn't met and the parties involved aren't informed typically in self inserts or other deage fics where one person is an adult in mind if not in body and the other is a child\\
the other issue is the power dynamic, a professor involved with a student, underage or not is not ok, the professor holds power over the student outside of their personal relationship which makes the consent given invalid
