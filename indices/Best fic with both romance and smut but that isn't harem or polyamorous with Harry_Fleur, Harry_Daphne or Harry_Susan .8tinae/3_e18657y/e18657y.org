One of the best with Fleur I've read is A Cadmean Victory. linkffn(11446957) It does have its cringe worthy moments, but come on, this is fanfiction, not pro work. The author does try to explain those moments, but the explanation is shaky at best.

Magicks of the Arcane linkffn(8303194) is a very good story, don't bother with what the little shits at DLP say about it. The romance is a very minimal part of the story though, and it features Fleur as a secondary character. There are a couple of Daphne moments, but that's it.
