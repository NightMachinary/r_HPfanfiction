While at first I enjoyed Cadmean, after reading more fanfics (it was the first Harry/Fleur fic I've read, at the time) it became clear how edgy and quite tropy it is, something I don't like.

For me, the takeaways of this fic are Fleur's personality, which I liked very much, even if it is a bit cliche'd, and Harry's relationship with Salazar. The scene where Harry sacrifices the portrait was really sad and moving.

Overall, Its enjoyable, but I wouldn't re-read it. Not to mention that there's 0 smut, which i asked for.

Magicks is a fic where I couldn't handle after reading past the Yule Ball. I'm a huge fan of Harry/Daphne, and the way the author treated her just made me ragequit. THAT being said, after a friend sent me a future chapter where there's a 4-way-battle between Harry, Dumbledore, Grindewald and Voldy, it sparked my interest, because it was so fucking well written.

So now its in my reserve fics to read after I'm done with what I'm reading. AFAIK there isn't smut too, though its a bit more raunchy than Cadmean.

Thanks for the suggestion though.
