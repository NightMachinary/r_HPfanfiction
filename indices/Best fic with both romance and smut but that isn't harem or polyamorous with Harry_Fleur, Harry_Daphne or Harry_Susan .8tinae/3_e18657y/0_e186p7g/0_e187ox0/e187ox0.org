I'm a fan of H/D as well, but as I understand it, that is very similar to how regular teenagers behave in the West. The 4 way battle doesn't involve Grindelwald, it's an undead warlock that Voldemort brings back to life. Has a name of Balthazar or something.

Well, if you really want smut badly, check out Harry Potter and the Siren's Song linkffn(6307611). There's plot too. H/D

For H/F, check this one. linkffn(11956676). Lel.

James Spookie has a few H/D fics and there is one scene each in them (I think - haven't read his stories in a while), but the plot leaves a lot to be desired.

There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12104688/1/Whispers-in-the-Night][this one]] as well. It's a harem one, H/S/D/F, and there is smut. Writing wise, its pretty meh.
