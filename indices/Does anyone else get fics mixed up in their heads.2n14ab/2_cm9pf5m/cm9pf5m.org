I used to get The Merging and The Legacy mixed up. The were published around the same time, both updated regularly and both featured a Harry learning occlumency over the summer. They also both featured Harry's horcrux as a prominent plot point.

Later on they diverged, but in the first 10 chapters or so I kept getting confused as to which occlumency belonged to which fic.
