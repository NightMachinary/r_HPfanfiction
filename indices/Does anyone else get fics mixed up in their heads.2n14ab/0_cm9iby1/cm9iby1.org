All. The. Freakin. Time.

I have completed reading a bit over 100 fics and another 60 or so that are incomplete (whether story isn't complete or I quit reading before end). I also don't have a terribly great memory, so I get the details mixed up all the damned time.

I realize a lot of you have probably read more fics but I've only been at it for about six months.
