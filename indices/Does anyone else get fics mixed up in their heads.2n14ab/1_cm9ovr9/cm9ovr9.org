Romances are the worst in this way. I have read maybe 20 Rose/Scorpius fics and Favorited maybe 5 or so. They're not great stories, but they're nice for a quick romance read. So there's nothing too memorable to set them apart but there are a few smaller things. No way to tell which is which at all so I just don't reread them.
