Just as a little tidbit of information. The term ward in reference to a magical protection is actually a /very/ recent usage of the word, largely from the last two decades or so. In the past an object might have warded off evil, but it wasn't in and of itself a ward.

This all comes together to mean that people in the HP universe would have almost certainly never said ward, it being a recently developed muggle term.
