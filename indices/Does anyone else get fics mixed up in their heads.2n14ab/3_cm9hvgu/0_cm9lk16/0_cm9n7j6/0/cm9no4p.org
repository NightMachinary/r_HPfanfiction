Earliest reference to wards as a type of protective spell that I recall is the Advanced D&D spells 'Guards and Wards' and 'Glyph of Warding' (published c.1978).

Where the designers drew their inspiration may have come from classic fantasy fiction of one sort or another (Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser; Elric of Melnibone; Chronicles of Amber), but the term comes from normal English- 'you stoke the fire to ward off a chill'. It's also the root word for Warden, an official who keeps the borders intact.
