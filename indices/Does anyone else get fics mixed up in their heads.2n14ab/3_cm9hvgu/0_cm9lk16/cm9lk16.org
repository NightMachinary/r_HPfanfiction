Confusing fanfiction for canon? That's not a mix up, that's an /advanced/ mix up. Small details like terminology (wards for example) that some might claim are not canon (and they can go fuck their technically correct--in that the word itself doesn't appear but magic that in any other fantasy would be called wards does--selves) are fine but mixing up whole major plot elements like the entire economy (and again, those who claim that's not canon either can piss up a rope because those who control the gold control the economy, period) literally collapsing into the ground is not something so easily mixed up. Maybe thinking that some background character headcanon is canon would be alright in that it isn't explicitly said not to be true, but all of gringotts sinking into the ground? What?

Have you had any other equally hilarious mix ups?
