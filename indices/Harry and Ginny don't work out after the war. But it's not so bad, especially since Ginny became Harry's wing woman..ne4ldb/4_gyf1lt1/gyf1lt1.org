That's a good idea. There's also the common twist in fan fic where Harry is gay and goes after Blaise, Draco, some random Gryffindor, etc...but it could be a twist where Ginny's a lesbian and not only is she's Harry's wing woman they playfully fight over women (like they place bets on if they thinks someone's bi or straight).
