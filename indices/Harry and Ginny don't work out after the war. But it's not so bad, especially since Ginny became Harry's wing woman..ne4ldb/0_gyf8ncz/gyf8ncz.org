I don't really like Harry/Ginny but I have to admit, I'm a sucker for a platonic besties relationship between them. There's so much potential in Ginny's outgoing, boisterous, and fun personality that just doesn't fit in when you're trying to balance a romantic relationship with them, but you can do so much with as friends.
