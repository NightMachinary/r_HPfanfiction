Interesting concept. Sirius' death could be traumatic enough to ignite a planeswalker spark in Harry, though by description it would probably happen in the moment, not while asleep. Ignitions usually happen in painful, emotional, powerful moments that are, in general, shitty enough for a person to literally RIP themselves out of their plane and fling themselves into the multiverse. Not so much of a in your sleep occurence.

Harry attempting to deal with Sirius' death and not being on his home plane anymore/unintentionally abandoning his friends while adapting to a new plane could make for a very fun read. Could play well as a two part story. One of an adventure on another plane and then part two being a fully realized planeswalker Harry returning to Earth with allies to lay the smack down on Voldemort.

Also, Fifth year Harry, dealing with Dumbledore all year, the dreams, the occlumency lessons with Snape, and then Sirius' death would almost certainly be a red or red white planeswalker. This is the Harry that not 15 minutes later would attempt to curcio Bellatrix
