It's typical human history that every group has tried to oppress every other group whenever they had the chance...

Why should relations between groups that are actually different species be any better? The HP world is full of bigotry (hem hem... Umbridge) it's quite likely that there are a lot of wizards that don't exactly like goblins, and a lot of goblins that hate wizards, it's practically a fanon joke that history of magic is 99% goblin rebellions that must've happened for reasons, I think if certain wizards found another excuse to limit the rights of goblins with international support they wouldn't hesitate.
