Yea, romance is hard as heck to write. I have hints of H/Susan in my fic, but it is like a paragraph in between chapters full of fighting.

I stand by my opinion of Not Only Redhead though. Harry is constantly SCREAMING AT EVERYONE, threatening people, acting as entitled as a girl from "My Super Sweet Sixteen", and (worst part) everyone applauds him for it because he's Harry Potter and he's /sooo/ grown up and assertive.
