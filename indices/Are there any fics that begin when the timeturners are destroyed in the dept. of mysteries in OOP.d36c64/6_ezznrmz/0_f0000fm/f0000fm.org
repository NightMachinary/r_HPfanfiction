Yeah. I actually started trying to write one myself a few years ago but I'm not a very good writer. The basic premise was that the backlash caused Neville's soul to be spread across the 4th dimension. Basically making him omniscient but not omnipotent. He can see see the shape of all history but can only impact it through prophecies. Essential idea is that Neville is the source of all prophecies.

Never really fleshed out all the rules or how I wanted to use the idea. But I still think it could be rather neat.
