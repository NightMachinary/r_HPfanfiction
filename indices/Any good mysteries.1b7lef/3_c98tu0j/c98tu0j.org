Dark Gods in the Blood "A wandering student comes home, a broken man pays his penance, and a gruesome murder is both more and less than it seems. Some paths to self-discovery have more twists and turns than others." Rated R, there are scenes of graphic violence. This is well written mystery, though if memory serves it does contain an element of Hermione (in her thirties)/Snape [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/hayseed/DGITB.html]]
