I've got no problem with him growing up. Its the whole 'I'm hurt so Jesus will come down snap his fingers and I'm healed' thing. Or how Carol can't be hurt because centuries old vampires destroy everyone until they run into a half way trained super soldier exponentially slower and weaker than her.

The writer is also running into the problem Marvel often has. There aren't many good villains available. He's made Magneto a follower, Loki a perfect citizen, and the "gods" all powerful unless you are against a teenage boy and his friends.

By all accounts Voldemort is a genius and craftier than even Harry, but he couldn't beat Dresden? Whose left to be a real antagonist to the main characters? Apparently every truly WMD of a super powered individual is blindly loyal to Harry.
