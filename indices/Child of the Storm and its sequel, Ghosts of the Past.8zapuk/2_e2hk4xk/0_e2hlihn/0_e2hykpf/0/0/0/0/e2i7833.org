          they are afraid of a Dark Phoenix, which isn't that hard to swallow.

That's true, but as the author pointed out it's only a shared of the Phoenix. So while that is powerful without a doubt, could dozens of entities on the cosmic scale not do anything about that?

Its part of why when I read the words: Godlike, Lord Potter-Black-Peverall-Emrys, helpful Goblins, magical inheritance, super rich, I stop reading. Any good story begins with a compelling plot, a great story begins with a desperate need. If there is no mountain or struggle why would I want to read. Superman stories might be the only ones that have gained an incredible following while being super OP.
