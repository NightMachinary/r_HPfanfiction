Honestly maybe not.

If I remember right, the skyfathers are around Multi-Galactic level, Phoenix force is well into Multi-Universal level. With such a massive difference in power, yea they shouldn't be able to do anything about it. If you're willing to debate about it shoot me a DM.

You can have good stories that deal with these, it is just extremely difficult to do right.
