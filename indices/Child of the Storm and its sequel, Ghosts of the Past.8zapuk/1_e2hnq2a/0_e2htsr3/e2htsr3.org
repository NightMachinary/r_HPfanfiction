Yeah, they're...long.

My personal opinion is that it suffers from a case of "let's include all the things because that'll be awesome" and the whole thing ends up being super long and somewhat hard to follow as a result. I admittedly don't read comic books, but even so I get the impression that it's more like a (super long) Marvel comic in pure text form that incorporates the HP universe than an HP fic that includes Marvel characters.
