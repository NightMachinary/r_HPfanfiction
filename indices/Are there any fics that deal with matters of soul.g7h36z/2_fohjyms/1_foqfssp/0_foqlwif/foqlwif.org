Its basically a 'Harry goes to another school to train' fic that gets a little out of control.

He finds a school which will teach him what he needs to know and trains in a whole bunch of magic that Hogwarts doesn't have, with a whole bunch of people/creatures that aren't in Hogwarts. Ie Vampires, fae, were-wolves, Demons, and a whole bunch more.

Its a pretty wide ranging story, but I really liked it.

If you read up until Harry gets to the school plus one or two chapters you will know by then whether you like it or not.
