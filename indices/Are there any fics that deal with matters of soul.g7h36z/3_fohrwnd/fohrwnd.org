This is one of mine that fits your brief - linkffn(11031294)

It's Harry Potter inspired by His Dark Materials where everyone has a daemon (an animal that is their soul). Tom Riddle appears as Harry's daemon.

Major spoilers below.

Dementors are people who have lost their own daemon and then devour another persons daemon. Harry ends up becoming half demented (ie he's monstrous/half decayed/wants to devour everyone souls) because Voldemort related plot. Also more soul interactions/effects along the way because of damage to ones soul.

Hope you enjoy.
