#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore arrives on Harry's parents' doorstep on the evening of his seventeenth birthday and reveals to him that Voldemort is not really dead. There is a Prophecy, and he believes Harry is the subject. But there is more to the Prophecy than even Dumbledore knows, and the Girl Who Lived, Iana Malfoy, will prove to be central to everything.
