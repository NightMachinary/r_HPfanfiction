I think you're talking about Descent into Darkness by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2328854/Athey][Athey]]. It was deleted from ffnet a while back but it seems she copied it to adult-fanfiction [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600095391][here]].

I recall being rather ambivalent about that story. It built up really well but the scene where Harry tortures and kills Rita Skeeter never sat right with me and then it does a 90 degree turn and starts saying how all Voldemort's actions are designed to benefit muggles. Maybe I'll read it again to see if it works better second time.
