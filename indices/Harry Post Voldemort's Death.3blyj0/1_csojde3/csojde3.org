I'm not sure if this fits, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8966727/1/Vengeance-from-the-grave][Vengeance from the grave]] deals with how Harry copes without Voldi to fight against, in its later chapters.

The story is pretty good overall, so maybe check it out, even if it doesn't hit your criteria spot on.
