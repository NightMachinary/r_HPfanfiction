  When the war ended all was well, at least for a little while. For Harry Potter life without his crimson eyed madman was even worse than with him. A drunken trip to Diagon reveals why Harry feels like he's slowly dying inside and the manipulating hooks that had been pierced into him, controlling him like a marionette. Is there a second chance? /MPREG/ used to be Ultimate Betrayal
