Not sure how to post a link but Where In the World is Harry Potter by nonjon (author of the much beloved A Black Comedy) might be up your alley.

It's a comedy crack fic that takes place after Voldemort has been defeated and Harry, who covertly learned a massive amount of magic - putting him at a Dumbledore level - basically decides to use his massive power to screw around and play a long series of pranks on the magical world while Hermione and Tonks try to track him down.

It's a pretty long story with two sequels and also happens to have my all time favorite usage of Nicholas Flamel
