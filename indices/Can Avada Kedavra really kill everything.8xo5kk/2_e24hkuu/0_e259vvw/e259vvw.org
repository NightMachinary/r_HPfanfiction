I think Nundus need 100 wizards to subdue it safely. As in for capture, not killing. But even if it was about killing the Nundu, i'd recon the difficulty is landing a hit on a fast moving agile creature thats spewing the plague everywhere. Also wands aren't snipers so getting close is an issue.

We don't know if things like bubblehead charm are sufficient against Nundu poison breath. Could be a contact poison for example. Or magical eats thru everything and gives you magic ebola in addition.

I think bringing down a nundu is more along the lines of 100 wizards surrounding a large area of thick jungle where the nundu is located and then creating some sort of a box/dome that they start to make smaller as they close in.
