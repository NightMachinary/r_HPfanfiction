What we know about the Killing Curse from canon is pretty much what you said. It kills "anything" (we only really see it used on humans and smaller animals). It induces death without any visible damage and without damage detectable by 1940s muggles. It deals explosive physical damage to non-living matter. Magical shields don't stop it, except for Sacrificial Protection. Spells colliding with it will stop it, although I think we only see Harry's brother wand and the Elder Wand do that in the books.

The problem with AK is that it's too powerful not only for crossovers, but for other parts of JKR's world. You need 100 wizards to take down a Nundu? Nope, just keep a couple of specialists who are trained to cast AK and authorized to use it on Class XXXXX creatures.

My headcanon is that AK kills by destroying the nervous system at the synaptic level, so that you would need an electron microscope to see what was wrong. This means that it would not work on plants. (I don't remember if we see any stray curses hit grass or trees in canon.) Also, hair, feathers, and possibly scales are made of dead cells, so they count as non-living matter. If a creature's natural armor is thick enough that AK's explosive effect can't punch through to the nervous system, it will block the curse. (This is what I did with the Nundu in /The Accidental Animagus/.)

I think wearing armor could block AK in theory, but it would have to be thick enough to withstand the explosive effect. If you tried to do that with steel, it would be too heavy to wear, but if it's an exotic material like Vibranium or carbon nanotubes, it could work. (Which I did with Hermione's buckler in /Lady Archimedes/.)

For crossover purposes, I would add the rule that because it acts on the nervous system, AK requires power proportional to the size of the animal. So if you cast it on, say, Godzilla, even if you could punch through his armor, you wouldn't be able to put enough power behind it to kill him, just because it would be ridiculous for any trained wizard to be able to one-shot Godzilla.
