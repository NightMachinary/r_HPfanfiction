  Therefore, could it be blocked by armour that is thick enough?

I think that question has been pondered a lot. I think you just have to assume that there's some kind of inherent spiritual/conceptual difference recognized by Magic between clothing and some other object that might block the path. Still doesn't explain why Aurors don't wear shields (and have a Mokeskin pouch full of shrunken replacements) or employ magical bombs they can throw which expel an expanding cloud of debris that would block any Killing Curse coming their way. Hermione or the twins could probably jerry-rig them something that listens for the words "Avada Kedavra" and auto-deploys.
