Armor is not enough to stop the AK. As to crossovers, well that is entirely up to the fanfic author since Rowling definitely didn't write with those in mind.

As to the point blank galactic system annihilation, well the AK may indeed kill that being. Unless it has equal resistance to magic. You see Harry Potter magic affects things on a conceptual level. According to Rowling magic always takes precedence over natural physics. So a spell that kills things could kill something that's described to survive everything non-magical. Also the killing curse isn't necessarily weaker than some sort of spell that makes a large bang. It just does a different thing.

Of course when you are writing about things that are stronger than the strongest beings in HP, you could plausibly make them above such things.

Also if the being is somehow immortal, the killing curse wouldn't stick.

AS to vibranium armor, if the armor is magically superior to anything in hp verse (and hp doesn't have much in that regard) then it's authors choice really.
