What if someone was able to create an armour that hovered a dozen centimeters away from the body, not connected physically in anyway to the person's body, but still covering it entirely while also having a secondary body armour to protect against any splinters or shards from the outer armor, if it gets damaged by spell fire ? (I'm talking HPverse, not xovers)

Using Naruto as an example of what I mean by this, IIRC, Gaara has a carapace of sand over his entire body to protect him from physical blows, while also having a 360ยบ shield of sand that protects him instinctly, kinda like Ryuseei Seikuken, from Kenichi, but made of sand, and not just awareness.
