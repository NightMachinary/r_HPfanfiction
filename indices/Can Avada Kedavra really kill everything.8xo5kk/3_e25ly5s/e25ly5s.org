I'm still working on how the Unforgivables fit into my AU magical theory, but I do think that magically resistant creatures will stand a chance of surviving. I refuse to believe that dragons, basilisks, nundus, etc can be brought down with a single spell by a mediocre wizard or witch. I like the comment by [[/u/Wu_Gang][u/Wu_Gang]] below saying that it could be designed to work on humans, and so there isn't a guarantee that it will work on other creatures. It often does (like the spiders in Goblet of Fire), but it isn't a certainty; especially with powerful creatures or ones not understood well by humans.

I also think that armour /would/ work to block the Killing Curse, if it were thick enough. However it'd get pretty messed up from a direct hit, and shrapnel is never fun. I haven't worked out when each Unforgivable was invented in my AU timeline, but if it is before medieval times then I think it could be a good additional reason for why knights wore metal armour.
