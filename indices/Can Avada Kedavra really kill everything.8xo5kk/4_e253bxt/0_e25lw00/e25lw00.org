We've seen it kill spiders and foxes, so it's not just humans.

On the one hand, it does feel a little unbalanced to have the Killing Curse able to one-shot a dragon or a giant. But on the other hand, being unbalanced is the whole point of the Killing Curse. It's equally unbalanced that a wizard like Goyle could one-shot a wizard like Dumbledore with the Killing Curse. It's the ultimate equaliser: though there are some measures a skilled wizard can take to try to survive, it still has to be taken seriously regardless of the difference in magical ability between the two people duelling.
