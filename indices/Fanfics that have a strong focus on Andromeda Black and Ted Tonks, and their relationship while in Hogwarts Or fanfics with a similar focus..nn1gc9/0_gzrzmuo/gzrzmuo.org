My favorite that is solely about Ted and Andromeda is a one shot, The Blacker the Berry by Appello: linkffn(11843531)

surrogate by 17734 is primarily Bellatrix/Voldemort but there is a heavy focus on Andromeda & Bellatrix as well, and consequently many scenes of Andromeda and Ted in their school days: linkao3(11682174)
