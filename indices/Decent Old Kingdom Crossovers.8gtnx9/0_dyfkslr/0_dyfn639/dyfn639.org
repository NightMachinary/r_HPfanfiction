If I wasn't working on another fic, I'd be looking into this. I'm having enough trouble with the one, though, so I'm not sure I should start on a second. I did consider it for a bit but wasn't sure how to meld the two worlds together (I'm not sure I'd want to just throw Harry into the Old Kingdom unless there was a plot device that actually made good sense).
