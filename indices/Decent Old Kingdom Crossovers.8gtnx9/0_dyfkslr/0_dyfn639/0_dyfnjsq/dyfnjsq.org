Plot devices are difficult, however, we have the Great Rift at the north of the Old Kingdom which is implied to open onto other worlds. If combined with His Dark Materials like experiments in the Harry Potter world it might offer a reason of sorts for someone to come through. I personally favour youngish Dumbledore because of the obvious comparisons between Ancelstierre and 1920s England, and the fact that a young Dumbledore could easily be regarded as a dedicated researcher: the sort of person who /would/ go through such a breach just to find out more.
