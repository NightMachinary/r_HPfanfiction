The mention of His Dark Materials made me think of the witches and Dumbledore talking about the sanctity of the soul and... Fawkes is a daemon, right? :p

But yes I was having trouble reconciling the time periods of each setting, and that works out really well. I was vaguely thinking about the viability of a fusion setting where The Old Kingdom is Scotland, and magic escaped into the world after the Wall was breached... but that raises the problems with tech levels even more.
