Current fave is Dobby's Deceit by morraine on AO3. It's got house elf awesomeness, too. The parseltongue, magical law, and ritual magic explorations are great....it has the Heir of Potter/Black/Slytherin stuff but it doesn't give Harry any extra powers. Plenty of bashing but the only one I don't fully care for is Snape as its a bit too creeptastic.
