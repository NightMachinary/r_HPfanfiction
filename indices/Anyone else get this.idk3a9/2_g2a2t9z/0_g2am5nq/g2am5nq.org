Go to AO3 and do a search for the Powerful!Harry tag or maybe Dark! or Gray!Harry. (Honestly I have no idea what the exclamation points mean or if they're necessary but they're usually there in the tag.)

Anyway, a lot of fics tagged that way will go that route with the multiple Lordship titles and super-powered Harry.
