The Exclamation points come from a thing called Bang Path Notation.

Bang Path Notation used to be used for email systems back when the internet was very young (and not actually called the internet), where the majority of civilian computing existed in places like Universities.

The Bang Path represented the route that an email must take to get to that user. So if you're in the same site say, you may only need one Bang notation (say Physics!Name, is a different person than English!Name), while if you wanted to Email someone in another country you'd need a Bang notation for every machine that it'd need to go through to get to that person.

So Powerful!Harry or Dark!Harry are both Harry's they're just different Harry's
