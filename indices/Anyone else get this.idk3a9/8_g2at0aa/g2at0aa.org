Fun Fact.

The first ever fanfic I read was a Naruto harem fanfiction where he comes back from his training mission with Jiraiya transformed into a partial kitsune that gives him special powers, and the rest of the fic is just him banging every other female in the Elemental Countries.

*All of them.*

The lemons were so explicit, and 10 yr old me somehow loved the story...
