don't get me started on this. I found a great one where Harry and Hermione time travel and assassinate DE's. Only Harry realized he was out of control and playing God whereas Hermione refused to admit she might be wrong. He went to Dumbledore and it was getting so good then no more chapters. The readers/edgelords started complaining about the plot twist and Hermione being wrong.
