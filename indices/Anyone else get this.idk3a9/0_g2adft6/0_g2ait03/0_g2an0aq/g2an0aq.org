I know there's at least one where the Weasley twins invent a magical version of TV screens, so Harry and his friends watch what's going on from inside the trunk (usually some sort of prank that they pulled).

There's also at least one where Harry gets the Vanishing Cabinets and puts one in the trunk, so he can teleport in and out of it.
