There's one of these that I've been looking for for /forever/, I've read it before and can't find it anymore, but if my memory holds up it was actually pretty well-written. It had harem, heirs, the founders and Merlin were there for at least a chapter, it had Dumbledore and Ron(at least) bashing but no Hermione bashing, and lord stuff. And I actually liked it.
