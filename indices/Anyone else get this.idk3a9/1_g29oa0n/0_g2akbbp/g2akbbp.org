I don't get what you mean. Do you mean you have an aversion to The Wizard of Oz or Hostess cakes? Do you mean you hate when smut scenes use ridiculous terminology as if the author was trying to euphemize everything for the kids? Is it the smut scenes in general you dislike? (If so, no objection here.) Or is there some other meaning I'm too sleepy to think of?

...Ahem.

But yeah, Lord Potter-Black usually only really irritates me if I read too many in a row. Vicarious power trips are /fun/, lol.

Agreed on the harems, too. They /can/ be done well, it's just...I can count on one hand how many times I've seen that in nearly 20 years of fanfic reading.
