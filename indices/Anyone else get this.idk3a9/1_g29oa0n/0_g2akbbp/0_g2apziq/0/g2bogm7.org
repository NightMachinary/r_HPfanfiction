Oh, ew, I know what you mean--putting things in quotations that don't belong in them is super-annoying. I see that onomatopoeia thing sometimes, and I try to turn it into a source of amusement by imagining the object as actually saying it, but it's still irritating. And I've seen stories where I couldn't tell if half the dialogue was actual dialogue or the character's private thoughts because they put it all in the same type of quotation marks.

...I can't believe I totally forgot about the existence of doorbells when I was coming up with silly ideas, lol.
