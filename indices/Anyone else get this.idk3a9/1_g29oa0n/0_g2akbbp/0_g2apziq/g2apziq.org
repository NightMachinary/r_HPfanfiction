Not the euphemism! Get those dirty thought out of your head! Lol. XD

I meant when like whoever went to the Dursleys' house and they rang the doorbell, the author literally put the words ding dong in quotations. "Ding Dong". That's literally what they did. They didn't even have a period at the end! It's the same with knock knock. Like, honestly. They're onomatopoeia! Unless you are actually /saying/ the words don't put them in quotation marks!
