Lol. I love Lord Potter-Black fics where he's independent. I don't care if it's full of plot holes or anything. The only thing I care about is if it has proper grammar and punctuation and they don't say "Ding Dong" in quotations or at all, really. The moment I saw someone say that I just noped right out of that fic.

Harems are horrible, though.
