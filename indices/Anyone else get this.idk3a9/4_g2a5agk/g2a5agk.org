Alright here goes...

Linkffn(Legends of Potter)

First fic I ever read and remember how much I loved it back then. Ends on a cliffhanger but has a completed sequel that wraps up the story. It doesn't hold up as well as I remember but if I'm in the exact mood you're describing it's pretty good. Has everything but the harem.
