I imagine so- I have some odd google searches from researching this, but apparently hair growth is connected to the blood vessels at the base of every hair follicle.

  These blood vessels feed the hair roots to keep them growing and break through the skin. By the time the hair reaches the epidermis i.e., the outer surface of the skin, the cells within that hair are no longer alive.

So if hair is technically dead, but can still be used for Polyjuice, it would seem logical to assume that whatever you're using doesn't need to technically be alive in order to use for the potion.

Hair also takes a lot longer to decompose than the rest of the body.

So here's my other guess: the state of the material used has an effect on the potion. So if you used decaying teeth or decomposing hair, the results you get from the potion might be less than ideal. To that end, I imagine using a rotting tooth from an alive person would also give you unsavory results.

So while you could go and pluck the hairs off a mummy and use them in a potion, you run the risk of being transformed into something gruesome based on how damaged the hair is from elemental decay, microbial decay, etc.

You could probably kill someone and use their hair and such to assume their form for a while but eventually you run the risk of the body parts going bad.

Counterpoint to my own argument: When Mrs. Crouch used Barty Jr's hair to change, she transformed into a sick person. If the potion can detect the well being of a person based on the ingredients, can't it tell when you're pulling ingredients from a corpse as well?

Maybe different parts have different levels of potency?

To conclude, I don't think there's enough information in the source material to be totally sure. But overall great topic, OP! It was really interesting to ponder.

Tl;dr- My guess is yes, you can- but depending on the state of decay, the results might be less than desirable.
