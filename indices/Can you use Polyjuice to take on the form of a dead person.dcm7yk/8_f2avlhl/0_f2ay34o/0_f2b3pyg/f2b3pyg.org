  Mrs Crouch was already sick and dying before she ever imbibed any Polyjuice Potion...

You're right, I'd forgotten about the “One dying person in, one dying person out” line. Jr. would probably feel the effects of her illness in her form. I'd say the physical ones at least.

What you mentioned is something along the lines of what I'm imagining too - using a dead persons essence would give the transformed body corpse-y qualities. I like to think that the longer someone has been dead, the more gruesome the final form will be. And after a certain point prove fatal to the consumer of the potion.

Of course, that particular head cannon probably wouldn't work with your story. And speaking of, the concept of your story sounds pretty cool. Are you planning on the use of Lily's hair having any long term health effects on your protagonist?
