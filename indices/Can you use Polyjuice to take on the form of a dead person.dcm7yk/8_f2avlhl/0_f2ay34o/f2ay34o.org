  When Mrs. Crouch used Barty Jr's hair to change, she transformed into a sick person.

Slight problem with this line: Mrs Crouch was already sick and dying before she ever imbibed any Polyjuice Potion, and it was in fact her dying wish to get her son out of Azkaban. So the real question would be what effect on Jr drinking the potion with something from his dying mother would have on him.

As for the rest of your post, I'm personally leaning towards it having some kind of negative side-effect to the person using a batch of Polyjuice laced with the essence of someone deceased.

In fact, that's essentially what I'll be doing in my Me-as-Daphne fic, where I (somehow) get some of Lily Potter's hairs, and end up looking like her, but with a greying complexion, and taut cracked skin; kind of like how some older depictions of vampires were described as looking.
