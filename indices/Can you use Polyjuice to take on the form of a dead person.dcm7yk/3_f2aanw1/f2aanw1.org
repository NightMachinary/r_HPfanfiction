I always figured the Polyjuice gives you the state of the person at the point where you got hold of the person's hair. Meaning that as long as you took the resources while the person was alive, Polyjuice should still function.

I have no idea what would happen if you try to Polyjuice using a dead person's hair. I don't think it'd simply render the potion inert, but I don't think anything good would happen.
