I'm completely uneducated on the subject and maybe all wrong here.. but based purely on the fact Barty Crouch Jr. kept Moody alive so he could continue taking his hairs and didn't just kill him and shave his head, I'd say the potion needs some kind of connection to a living being to work.

I think Invasion of the Body Snatchers had a similar concept, where the host has to remain alive for a shapeshifter to take their form. The original bodies were sealed in cocoons while the replicant walked around pretending to be them.. not unlike Moody in the trunk then, actually. Maybe JK found some inspiration there? That's all just my guess anyway.
