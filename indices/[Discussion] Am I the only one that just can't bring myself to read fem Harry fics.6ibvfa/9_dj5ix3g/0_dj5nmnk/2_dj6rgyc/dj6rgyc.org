I think it has much to do with Naruto's personality, he is brash, dumb, impulsive but inside he suffers from insecurity. this translates to a girl who is loud and annoying but has a vulnerable side you want to protect, in one word it's Gap Moe. then the writers usually pair her with stoic characters like Sasuke, Shikamaru, Itachi or even Kakashi this creates a good contrast and a dynamic that allows a lot of fluff and comedy.

Check out Hokage's Bride, Protective Instincts, All Started with a Smell, My boyfriend is a trap, Teacup Tempest, Threads of Fate.

on the other hand Harry is a bit more serious than Naruto, and he tends to brood and he really doesn't have someone good to pair him with, from the top of my head the classics would be Draco, Cedric, The Twins, Neviile, Ron. really i can not think of any character that would have good chemestry with Harry without to resorting to OOC.
