I think the key difference is that the other series actually has the female ninja treated a little bit differently so the authors have something, one thing that they can see in the story and don't have to come up with on their own, that they can use to show that now something is different without concentrating on the usual thing. The fact that the world of that story has a fairly well-known technique that anyone or almost anyone can use that at the very least can give someone the appearance of someone of the opposite sex probably does help it a bit as well, what with the fact that it's used for comedic purposes in the series rather than anything pairing-related.

That said, most of their stories of that kind are probably junk too.
