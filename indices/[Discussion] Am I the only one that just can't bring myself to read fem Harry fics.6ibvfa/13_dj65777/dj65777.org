Fem!Harry doesn't really bring anything significant to the table that regular Harry doesn't in my opinion. The most gendered thing about Harry is his friendship with Ron. They wouldn't become fast friends otherwise. Ron is usually ignored or bashed though so that isn't usually explored.

In theory, Snape reactions to a Harry that looks like Lilly could be interesting, but fics usually take it to a creepy place. Even that could be okay if the story portrays and acknowledges that its creepy.
