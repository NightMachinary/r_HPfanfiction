The thing is, Harry is never overtly male. He's said to be a male, but we never get a real glimpse into that. He doesn't automatically start noticing girls as a normal guy would, his gaze doesn't lower when faced with a pair of large breasts. Not to mention Hermione herself being a sort of lead character and an important part of the story. While I find her annoying, personally, I know many people that think Hermione is "WOMANEMPOWERMENTâ„¢".
