I see this as one of the most common arguments against genderswapping and I think that while it sometimes has a point, it also misses another. Slash and femslash are written to fill a lack that canon has. The same goes for genderswaps: a lot of fic writers are female and a lot of lead characters are male, so of course there will be stories where people go, "Hey, what if this was a girl's story instead?"
