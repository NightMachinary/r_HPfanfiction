Nah, I'm not a fan of them either; be it HP or elsewhere. Mostly because most of the ones I (tried to) read were clearly trying to make a ship work, but they were anti-slash so they swapped a character. There are others that clearly didn't do it for that, but I still have no inclination to read them.\\
except for The Red Knight, maybe. It's not Harry-centric, but he's fem, and it's not that irritating. And also a parallel universe, which might have something to do with it.
