I have a soft spot for Fem!Harry myself (I'm in the process of plotting out a Fem!Harry fic that'll be very heavily AU and feature Fem!versions of a lot of other characters)...

...but I'd say that for the MOST part you're not missing much by skipping the Fem!Harry fics. Most of them seem to be pretty uninspited canon rehashes where Harry's either the exact same just with some swapped pronouns and a different love interest, or a super-special-amazing-beautiful witch who's just so much better than canon Harry but somehow manages to have pretty much all the same experiences as him.

I think what I like the most about the idea of Fem!Harry is the concept of exploring how things would be different for a GIRL Who Lived. Just how would the wizarding world treat "Harriet Potter"? So few fanfics actually bother to explore this, and so many just write Fem!Harry so that they can pair Harry up with a male character without having to write slash.

Actually, the only fic I can think of that bothers to explore the difference is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6343543/1/Harry-the-Mysterious-Curse-of-the-GirlWhoLived][Harry And The Mysterious Case Of The Girl Who Lived,]] which is... kind of a Fem!Harry story and kind of not. Harry's a boy in the story, but he's under some weird curse that makes everyone magical think he's a girl.
