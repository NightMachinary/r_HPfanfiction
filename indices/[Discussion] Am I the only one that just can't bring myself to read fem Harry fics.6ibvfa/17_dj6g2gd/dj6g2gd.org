I don't hate them by default, as it is easier for me to identify with a female character and we all (or close to it) want to identify with the protagonist.

That said, I won't consider something good just because it has the main character changed to a girl if it's a piece of junk, and is it wont to be with any kind of story the majority is junk. Also, forced pairings can go die in a fire. Ugh.
