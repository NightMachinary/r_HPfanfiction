I can only read them when they're kind of troll-ish. Usually, when they come off as a serious fic, the plot and character interactions usually come off as very forced. Obviously, that's because the author is doing the gender swap for a reason, and that reason is usually quite arbitrary but the entirety of the fic will be steered in that direction. Usually that's for a pairing that I have 0 interest in.
