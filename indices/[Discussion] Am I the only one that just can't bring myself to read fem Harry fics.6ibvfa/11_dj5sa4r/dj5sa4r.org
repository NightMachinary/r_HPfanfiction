You're definitely not alone. I can't read them either; I feel like being a boy/man is so much of Harry's character. I dunno. Nature and nurture plays a part, and too much would be different. I've read a few trans Harry fics, but genderswap fics don't really do it for me.

*Edit: should add that I only read slash and it usually feels like a cheap way to make a normally slash pairing "straight."
