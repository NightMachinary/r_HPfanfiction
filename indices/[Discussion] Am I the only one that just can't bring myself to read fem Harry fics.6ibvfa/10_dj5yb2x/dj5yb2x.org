I've attempted reading fem-Harry a couple of times, never made it very far. It always comes across as weirdly sexist to me. Like it has to make big changes out of the different gender to make an actual story and it often feels forced. Also it's like reading a slash pairing under the pretense it's not slash, reading fixes purely for the romance isn't really me.
