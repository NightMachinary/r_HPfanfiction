It depends: I can enjoy a genderbend Harry story or one where he suddenly discvoers he's a metamorphagus, because it's still the same old Harry I know and understand. It's potentially interesting how he reacts to suddenly having a female body - at least as long as the author doesn't magically turn him into a girl (personality-wise).

Fem!Harry stories though, where she was born as a girl and always has been a girl are often really weird. Maybe I'm sexist too, but I do not know this person. Growing up as a girl (especially with the Dursleys) must be so very different than as a boy and when the author often expects me to accept that everything is just the same (being friends with Ron and Hermione, the troll incident, etc etc) it's really weird.
