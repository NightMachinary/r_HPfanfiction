The best advice I heard about writing female characters as a male author was "Don't write women, write /people./" My problem with the genre is that, aside from how external characters view fem!Harry, not terribly much /should/ change. And yet some people treat the genre as if chopping off Harry's dick "magically" makes him/her a better character.

No! Harry shouldn't be awesome for being a girl, Harry should be awesome for being /Harry,/ regardless if Harry is a he or a she. Gender /shouldn't/ matter; characters should just be awesome.

And yet so many fem!Harry authors loose sight of that. It drives me crazy.
