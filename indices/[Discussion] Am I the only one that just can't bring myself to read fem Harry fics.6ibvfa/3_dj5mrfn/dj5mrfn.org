I really, really like fem Harry because I like reading about awesome female characters doing awesome things. That being said, pretty much all of the fics out there suck, so I see where you're coming from.

I hate fics that are only made to achieve a specific pairing or that don't have any original or interesting plot elements, and unfortunately that's about all there is to choose from.
