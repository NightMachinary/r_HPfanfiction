I really liked linkffn(The never-ending road) for this reason. It has been a while since I have read it so I don't remember too many details, but her character was just so good. She was definitely Harry like in personality with his headstrong desire to do what is right, the sassy attitude to deal with things and yet a lot softer, less confrontational, with feminine qualities and more subdued. I actually found myself relating to her which I don't usually find is the case for me when I read Hermione or another female or even another fem!Harry as a main character. Also it wasn't a canon rehash which is always nice to read. The supposed future pairing of this fic still creeps me out but thankfully for all that is written of it right now there is no pairing at all at this point and everyone is more or less acting in character.
