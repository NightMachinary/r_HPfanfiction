I still recommend that you read it because The Never-ending Road is fully complete and there hasn't been any romance. It's very possible to read it as gen if you forget the future pairing. And if you want to skip any hints, you could still read up to the Prisoner of Azkaban part. Harriet is characterized extremely well in this story. I haven't found another fem!harry that actually feels like Harry.
