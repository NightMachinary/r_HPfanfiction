  And yet, most fem!Harry fics are nothing but slavish Canon rehashes

It's the thoughtlessness of the worldbuilding and characterization that irritates me. fem!Harry would be similar but not the same.

There are so many changes that might occur: Maybe Petunia would see it as a second chance to convince a "little sister" that the ways of wizards is /Unnatural/. Maybe she would hate Harry's guts for looking too much like Lily. Maybe people would notice a skinny girl with secondhand clothes and family who doesn't like her more readily than they would a boy. Maybe Sirius wouldn't go after Peter because the subconscious reaction towards a goddaughter might be different than that towards a godson. Maybe her upbringing would make her solve conflicts in subtler, softer ways as girls and women must do. Or instead, she might grow up harder, meaner, to hold her own, to prove that she was strong. Or she might turn to comedy to shelter herself, I don't know.

I don't hate AUs or genderswaps or OCs or slash or anything really -- I just want to see some /effort/ put into it.
