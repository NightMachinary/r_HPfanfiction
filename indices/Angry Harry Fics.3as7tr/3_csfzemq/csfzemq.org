I love angry!Harry stories, but most of the ones I know of are closer to one-shots, or perhaps two or three chapters. Even [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9750991/1/Angry-Harry-and-the-Seven][Angry Harry and the Seven]] (non-mobile link) posted earlier only has three or four really good "Harry losing his shit" moments, but they are fantastic scenes, especially when [[/spoiler][Harry, after being told that his attendance at the Halloween Feast is mandatory, shows up in the Great Hall to remind everyone that they're basically celebrating the murder of his parents. Loudly.]]

The others I know of:

linkffn(Rage by Wanda Ginny Greenleaf)

linkffn(One Wizard Too Many)

linkffn(The British Reformation)
