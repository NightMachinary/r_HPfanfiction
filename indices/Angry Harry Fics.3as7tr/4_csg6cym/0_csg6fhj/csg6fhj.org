  AU. Don't-give-an-eff!Fem!Harry. Starts during OOTP. Marie's been having a frustrating summer, a frustration that she tries to relieve in perhaps not the most sensible way. But she doesn't care. She's tired of caring. Screw being the hero for those fickle people, Marie was going to take care of number one.
