Ultimately this depends on how you treat the statute of secrecy.

Option 1: The statute merely made official what had been de facto the case already: that wizards did not typically involve themselves in Muggle affairs. When the statute was passed, little had to be done to create secrecy, because it was already the case that most Muggles did not interact with wizards.

Option 2: Prior to the statute, wizard and Muggle society was fully integrated with wizards involving themselves in society. When the statute was passed, wizards actively removed these elements from Muggle history and awareness.

If you choose option 1, then your history should be relatively accurate, because real history still largely holds. If option 2, then what we Muggles consider history is a highly edited version of events, with the wizards knowing the true history of the world. In this case, you have a lot more freedom to create your own version of history in your fanfic.
