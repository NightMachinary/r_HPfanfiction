No matter who you look at the Statute of Secracy, you should aim for as close to historical accuracy as you can manage unless you are explicitly changing something for the story, and even then, the changes you make should have some sensible historical basis.

In this scenario, there is a not-so-fine line between laziness and worldbuilding. I understand it's not possible to know absolutely everything about a prior era, but just because you're working in a quasi-fictional historical world doesn't mean you can substitute a a fictional history for period research.

The correct approach is to research the historical era, people, places and events surrounding the set and setting for your story, use it as a basis for the fictional world, and then implement specific and targeted changes to that history based on the fictional world you want to create.

  I got a few feedbacks saying that some of the vocabulary doesn't mean what I make it out to mean. Well, obviously, or not? Muggle historians after the Statute was in place would not be able to write the actual history of it all down. My use of "seidr" being effectively the witches of the Norse was frowned upon, for example.

This explanation sounds like it could have come about one of two ways.

1. You researched the historical terminology from the time period for the various cultures in the region (presumably Norse and Danes in Britain sometime around the 1000s CE) and made the intentional decision to change some of the vocabulary to fit the story better. Your critics, while potentially correct in their protestations, are making irrelevant points, as you've already made the conscious decision to change some things around.

2. You looked up a few Norse terms and decided to use those as they were the first ones you found and it sounded cool, and would be easiest to just go with it. People criticized your obvious ignorance about vocabulary and language about the time period (either correctly or incorrectly). You then justified your ignorance by rationalizing that everything pre-statute is fictional anyway, so who cares if you got some minor details wrong.

I'm not going to attempt to discern which of the above is closest to the truth, but I think I've made my point. You want to be closer to the first possibility than the second.
