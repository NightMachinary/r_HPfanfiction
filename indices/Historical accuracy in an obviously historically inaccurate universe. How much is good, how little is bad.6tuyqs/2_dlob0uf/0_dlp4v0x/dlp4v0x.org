For my personal work I looked at the stuff on wikipedia, in the books I bought, or the documentaries I saw and filed them as "this is the stuff the muggles saw and documented". Its the outside perspective on magic, heavily influenced by myth and legend, and of course, doctrine.

For example, most of what we know of Vikings is what catholic monks wrote down. So you have the perspective of the victims of severe and unbelievably brutal raids (the blood-eagle is just one testament to that), and you already have to interpret this information with a bit of distance. What is factual, what is hyperbole?

Same with magic within the internal logic of the universe. What is simply hyperbole and muggle superstition and what do their reports give me to form and describe the practice of magic of different traditions of magic? In the end it won't be the same as reported.
