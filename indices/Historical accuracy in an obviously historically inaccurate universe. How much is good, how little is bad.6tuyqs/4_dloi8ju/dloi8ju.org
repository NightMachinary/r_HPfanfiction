My process:

- Decide on what magic can do for what cost/effort (i.e. figure out the laws of magic in your universe, at least vaguely)
- Extrapolate from that how new magic might be invented or found in nature.
- Look at the societies you are writing about, and their precursors and peoples they interacted with as far back as history goes, including of course their religion and myths.
- From that, figure out how the magics in those myths and legends fit into your universe's magic system.
- Extrapolate what magics might have been misunderstood, made taboo, had interesting sociopolitical effects, or been subject to rules of thumb that worked in most cases but would fail spectacularly in the right cases (which is a very convenient plot device, and fun for the reader if you only leave hints as to what went wrong).
- Then iterate back and forth between that step and the history-step, building up a narrative of how the magic shaped the actual history and vice versa.

But it's kind of intense and wall-of-text-notes-y, and that's coming from a person who will sit for an hour to type a wall of text. (this one only took five minutes or so).
