Hey you should read this too:

[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-malfoy-family]]

"The Malfoy name comes from old French and translates as 'bad faith'. Like many other progenitors of noble English families, the wizard Armand Malfoy arrived in Britain with William the Conqueror as part of the invading Norman army. Having rendered unknown, shady (and almost certainly magical) services to King William I, Malfoy was given a prime piece of land in Wiltshire, seized from local landowners, upon which his descendants have lived for ten consecutive centuries."

Edit: Wow, I didn't realize she'd added a bunch of details on the major wizarding schools since I last looked. Awesome! The African one sounds pretty badass.
