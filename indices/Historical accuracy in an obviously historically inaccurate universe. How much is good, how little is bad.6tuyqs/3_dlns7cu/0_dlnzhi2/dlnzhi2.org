Realism (or, rather, Consistency) is not just about making it easier for the reader to accept the fantastical, but also about letting your reader understand the world and made predictions about it.

The reason (in my opinion) why the Sword of Truth books were unsatisfying was because 90% of the book didn't matter. The main character just pulled a new magical ability out of his ass to solve the book's problem in the last five minutes. Even worse, some of the solutions were contrary to the world! At no point does the reader get to feel clever because they figured it out. No, the reader just feels blindsided because the solution was "fuck it, magic, I guess?"

Contrast that with the Mistborn series where the capabilities and limitations of magic are fairly well known and the protagonist must use the pre-existing world to prevail, rather than just saying "I win" and then winning.
