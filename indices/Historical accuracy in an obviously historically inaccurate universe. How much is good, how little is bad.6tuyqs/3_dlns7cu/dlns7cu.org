I can't remember who, but a successful fantasy author once said that making the world as realistic as possible was important for fantasy because it helped the reader believe in the world more. That it was easier for a reader to accept the fantastical when basic details of everyday life were believable.

I am no historian, but reading a Founders fic where basic things are off annoys me. Like there not being a language barrier. It's so easy to fix this issue with a few lines about a character casting a translation spell. Because it'd be a big problem if a person were to really go back a thousand years. Similarly, making gender dynamics the exact same as they are nowadays just makes the story feel inauthentic, even though I don't know exactly how men and women would have interacted back then. Bonus points go to stories that point out the lack of eating utensils back in the day, etc. I suppose it's mostly a personal thing, because stories I read that have the food and eating habits be the same as now don't bother me as much. So stories that read counter to what I'd expect to find back then annoy me, whereas someone with different expectations would be annoyed by different inaccuracies.
