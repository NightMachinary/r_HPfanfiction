I've often wondered the same thing, in regards to my story "Seasons of the Witch". On one hand, I wanted it to be as accurate as possible, yet on the other, I still wanted it to feel like an HP story.

The issue was, that I simply wasn't a historical expert. I could do research, sure, but wikipedia and google searches would only get you so far, and you'd get called out all day long by people who are actually from those countries, and know the language and history.

So, I decided to eschew the historical accuracy in favor of better storytelling.

There was a thread previously, with a similar topic, also with a story posted (it focused on Salazar and Godric, iirc). I see it done a lot in historical fiction, where the story is written in English, but the author always uses foreign words for nouns, usually in italics. Seidr is a good example, and its one I came across in my research as well, and I ultimately decided against using it myself.

The problem is, it's just jarring. It kind of breaks the immersion. What if the context for the word isn't good enough, and the reader can't figure out what the word is supposed to mean? It's not crucial for historical accuracy either, as I've found that whole practice to be kind of arbitrary, like just marking off a checkbox. The whole point of writing in English is to have a common medium to tell a story, so when you're using another culture's word for city, or witch, or army, or noble, it doesn't always come off smoothly. For the sake of storytelling, it's probably best to just keep it simple.
