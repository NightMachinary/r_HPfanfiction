How would you go about the vocabulary used when there is a definite difference between the witches (and wizards) of the world? In my fic I work with different traditions behind every magical culture. There are Seidr and VÃ¶lva, who are in the process of merging two viking traditions of magic, with "runemasters" and sorcerers on the other side who slowly but steadily exchange "feminine" magic and "masculine" magic. There are the celtic wicca and druids, the danish heks, we'll see germanic hexen and even some greek, persian and berber.

I took the path of using these names and translation of "witch" to emphasize the difference between their magical traditions. I'm not sure though. Would you exchange it all for "witch" and "wizard"?
