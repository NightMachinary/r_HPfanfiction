PoS and WDW definitely don't share the same storyline, but maybe the claims of plagiarism come from the tense relationship between Harry and James while maintaining an ok relationship between Harry and his brother. There is definitely a lot of similarity between PoS James Potter and WDW James Potter in behavior; but it's what I expect of the WBWL trope at this point.
