Well, similar is somewhat relative (there aren't really any other immortal Salazar fics):

linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): possibly the best AU HP story, Voldemort won and rules like a boss

linkffn(Patron): the shorthand is muggleborns are far less common and this lead to far greater divergences culturally in wizarding society.

linkffn(The Firebird's Son: Book 1 of the Firebird Trilogy): ever heard of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y:_The_Last_Man][Y: the Last Man]]? Well this fic is sort of that without the end of the world (yet) and magic. It sounds like i'm exaggerating...but I'm not.

linkffn(The Skitterleap): this fic is probably the closest in setup to Reign of the Serpent, even if the style of story is radically different

linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent): ignore everything after GoF. This fic created a new world of HP from what was already existing in 2002, introducing characters and storylines that in many ways put shame to Rowling's own plot threads (the dude even predicted the concept of horcruxes).
