That's usually how fascism works, yeah. A constant tightening of what it means to be "pure" - at first, the muggles would be enslaved, and "made useful". When that's done, simply being magical isn't enough anymore - now Muggleborns are murdered or "made useful". Once the muggleborns are all gone, Halfbloods are next, with ever-more scrutiny - eventually, even a single drop of muggle blood will be enough for even a pureblood to be exterminated. If the resistance doesn't overthrow the government at this point, humanity is gone for good.

Fascism /always/ eats itself alive. And I have a huge problem with any fic that attempts to portray it as functional in any way.
