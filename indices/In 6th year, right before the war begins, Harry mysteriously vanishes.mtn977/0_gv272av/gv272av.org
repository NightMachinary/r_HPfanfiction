Firstly, You have to give something to Harry. Otherwise it looks like 30 years of gain to Voldemort and co, and nothing on Harry's side. In this world, he is dead even before a single movements happens.

Secondly, is it only Britain based? I highly doubt outside England, anyone is going to align with Voldemort. And Voldemort is not going to leave the entire world to Victorian era. It's way too big for that. The simple reason - the knowledge is there. I highly doubt Voldemort would have the ability to censor science from Europe to Africa, to USA, to Brazil, to India, to Australia. In a large scale of thinking, I doubt wizards can control the entire muggle world because it's too big in quantity. It's not as if anywhere canon says Voldemort was a threat to someone outside England.

I like your idea but I don't think it works in a realistically.
