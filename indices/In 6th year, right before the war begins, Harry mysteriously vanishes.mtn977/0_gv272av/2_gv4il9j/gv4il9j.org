In the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/10461539/BolshevikMuppet99][Downward Spiral series]], Voldemort eventually wins the war and eliminates the entire muggle race. I don't know if it's plausible for Voldemort to enslave them all, but it certainly seems more likely than killing every single one of them.

In my fic's world, I would probably go with using ley lines to interrupt muggle technology and enslave the world. They would have to be activated manually (at the same time) via blood sacrifice by a wizard, meaning it would require (insert occult numerical value) of wizards to work and would engulf the entire Earth. This would still leave a large muggle population, and Voldemort would need to use population control to make sure there are only enough muggles to use as slaves.

His long term plan would be to breed wizards to eventually be more common than muggles. He would also breed house elves and when the time was right, eliminate muggles altogether because they wouldn't be needed anymore. I don't think his cruelty is stronger than his pragmatism.

I agree with your point on Harry's power level. His 'power the dark lord knows not' would have to be something that lets him get by in a world that would be hostile to his very existence. I'd have to brainstorm to come up with something that would make his journey a little easier. I'm always wary when considering powers for characters because the line between powerful and OP is often murky.

Something which I think may work is that anytime Harry dies, he is instantly sent back to the passage so he can restart his journey (and keep memories). This idea is from a [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/874260/The_Forgotten_City/][game]] which is coming out soon. I think it would work, and any choice Harry made would be devastating since he'd have to start over again if he made a wrong one.
