It would really not be that hard to topple muggle society and technology. All that really needs to be done is prevent overseas trade as most places kinda rely on imports from other nations. While most nations are having food shortages, then he merely needs to take care of power plants then most of our technology would be useless. Sure there would be other ways for muggles to generate energy, but without large scale energy production large parts of the world will be without power.

Doubtful that wizards can control most of the world. But they don't need to. As long as there is no communication between muggles and no place where muggle power can centralise, muggles would play no real threat.
