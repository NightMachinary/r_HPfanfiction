I don't really agree. This is coming from someone who hates muggle wanks, and believes wizards in HP world are superior to muggles.

Suppose Voldemort conquered England. As soon as muggle England fails. The whole other world knows wizards exists. And there will be other wizards from other countries who wouldn't support Voldemort. They can and will come against him. (Think how USA, Russia, England, and France cone together against Hitler.) It will be way too chaos for Voldemort and co to remotely be able to do anything. Voldemort has more to lose by attacking muggles. If Voldemort rejects peace treaty with muggles, suppose Russia/USA/China decided to nuke England. Even if wizards can protect themselves against nuke (and I believe they can), England will be too toxic to live anymore. I also think they will have an arrogance that Muggles couldn't do anything against them which is simply wrong.

Secondly, muggles will always be able to communicate each other. The radio technology isn't going anywhere. Wizards are too ignorant to cut muggle power supplies and that type of stuff. Voldemort has way too less man power to do anything. A mere 2-3 thousands of death eaters are walking deads in muggle world if muggles know these guys are death eaters simply because they don't know how muggle world works. Suppose death eater A is in charge of cutting power supply in Singapore, I doubt an arrogant death eater as depicted in canon, would be able to do it. It's entirely possible that they would rather kill themselves accidentally in hilarious ways.
