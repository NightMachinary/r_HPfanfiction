This is so unrealistic that to make it work it has to be a dream.

A test or a challenge set by the labyrinth to test Harry's character, he must overcomes despair in the face of a true nightmare from which (it feels like) there is no escape.

It is a remnant of a failed experiment by Godrick Gryffindor to create a room for training and strengthening courage and will.

Time does not pass much outside thebroom but he comes out half an hour later with 30 years of experience in guerilla warfare, distorted values and serious PTSD.

Once this is over Harry gets to read (pretty useless) journal by Gryffindor which only rubs sault over the wound of this whole situation.

Once he is out, he feels spaced out, unbelieving that he is back, that decades of freaking hell on Earth was some sick fantasy conjured up by broken experiment of half-witted Gryffindor.

Bitterness against magic and people who did not have to experience what he had, becomes a prominent feature of his character.

The fic is dealing with how he is an irritable and paranoid asshole to everyone. Luna ship, with her dragging him out of depression kicking and screaming so to speak, lots of fluff after 10 chapters of agonising torture porn.

Here is what I think this prompt should result in :).
