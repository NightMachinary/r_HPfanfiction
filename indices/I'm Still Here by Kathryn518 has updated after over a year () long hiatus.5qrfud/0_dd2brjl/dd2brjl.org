My biggest issue with this story is the writing. For some reason, the author (authors?) have a "why use 10 words when you can use 500?" philosophy.

"Heavy-handed" isn't even in it. Frequently you'll see scenes immediately rehashed from another PoV, just to make sure the reader really, really, really understood what was happening.

The writing just kills any kind of nuance or imagination on the part of the reader.

Reading this thing feels like reading this paragraph over and over and over:

  Harry paused, his left foot falling just short of the door as a surprised smile slowly crept onto his face. He'd just seen a naked house elf, and it was surprising, which is what made him stop moving, and also what made him smile in a surprised sort of way. "Oh, my, a naked house elf," said Harry, smilingly surprisingly, "that's surprising."
