Just finished the chapter and it was pretty awesome. It's still power wank and the pacing is still reeeeally slow but it was a good chapter overall. Harry is appropriately epic and disturbingly depressed, he does a decent job at hiding the latter to the general public but we get some nice insights into his psyche and i especially liked how the Horcrux gets handled. No silly goblin healing rituals or a simple potion to fix a serious problem.

It's consistent with the rest with the rest of the story (although we're luckily moving away from the overly evil and rape inclined Slytherins) so anyone who liked the story before will probably love this chapter.

I do wish that it had been a little shorter though. Maybe dividing it in two or three separate parts might have been better.
