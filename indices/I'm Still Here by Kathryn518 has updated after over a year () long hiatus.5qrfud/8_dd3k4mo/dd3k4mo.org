The typical female writer creates male perspective multi fic. None of the writing is believable, and Fleur's accent is so unnecessary. Literally, all you have to do: "Fleur said in a thick french accent". I also enjoy how sometimes that author warps the words to the point where I can't read them, loads of fun.
