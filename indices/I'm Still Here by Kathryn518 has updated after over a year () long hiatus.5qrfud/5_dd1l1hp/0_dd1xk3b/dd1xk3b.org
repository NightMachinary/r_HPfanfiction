Her SW crossover started great.

And then it devolved to pointless Jedi bashing, rants that take 10k words to finish, needless exposition and horrible flirting.

I still read it, but damn it gets old really quick. I don't think I'd be able to actually keep reading it if she updated frequently since then I don't have the 'cooldown period' that I need to progress all the pointless shit she managed to put in each chapter.
