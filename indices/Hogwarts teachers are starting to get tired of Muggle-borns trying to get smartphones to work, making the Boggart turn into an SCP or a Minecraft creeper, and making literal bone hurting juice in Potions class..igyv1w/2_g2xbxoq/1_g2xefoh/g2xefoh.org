Off-topic, but why are Weeping Angels perceived as so scary? I mean the episode has an eerie/horror vibe to it, but I think Dementors are way scarier. A weeping angel will send you in the past and if you're lucky enough you might even live a decent rest of your life. Being stuck in Azkaban with wraiths constantly sucking every little oz of happiness and hope out of you and if you cross them they'll eat your soul so you won't even be able to move on to the afterlife... now that seems like hell.
