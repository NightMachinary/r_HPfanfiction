  A weeping angel will send you in the past and if you're lucky enough you might even live a decent rest of your life.

First of all, they're feeding on your life force while you're in the past. They /eat/ all the years you would have lived. Second, they only send you to the past if they're hungry. If they're not, they snap your neck and/or torture you. And pictures or even /visual memories/ of them become actual Angels.

Also, they're known to trap victims in cells and send them back in time... to the same cell.
