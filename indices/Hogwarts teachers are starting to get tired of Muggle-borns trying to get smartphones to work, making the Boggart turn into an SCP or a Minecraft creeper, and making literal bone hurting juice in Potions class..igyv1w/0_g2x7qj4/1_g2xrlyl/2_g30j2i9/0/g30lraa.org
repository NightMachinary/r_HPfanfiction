SCP 173 just snaps your neck. If your moderately lucky a Weeping Angel just snaps your neck. If you are unlucky, the Weeping Angel traps you in a prison cell in the past and torments you by looping you back over your own past so you meet your elderly self that spent their whole life trapped by the Angels. If you are very lucky you escape and live out a life in the past.
