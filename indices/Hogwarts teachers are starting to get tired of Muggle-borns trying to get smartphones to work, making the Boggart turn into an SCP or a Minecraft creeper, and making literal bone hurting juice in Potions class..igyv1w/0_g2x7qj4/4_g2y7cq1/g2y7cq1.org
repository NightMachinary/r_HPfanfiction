Only if it can duplicate their effects to a significant degree. For instance, I don't see a Boggart turning into a functional Nuke. It would assume its image, and I presume very likely attempt to duplicate its effect with magic, but as seen with the Boggart-Dementor, it struggles with strong magical effects.

It probably depends on if cognitohazards work in this universe, or if it basically has to "cheat" to create the effect. If they do exist, then you're fucked.
