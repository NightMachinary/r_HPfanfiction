Well, I literally just posted this same request without knowing, for "In another place".

What a coincidence. That's slightly disturbing.

However, you have just given me another to read then! Who knows, maybe the two posts will get more requests eventually?

Edit: Many thanks for the 200k words I now have to read, in your debt
