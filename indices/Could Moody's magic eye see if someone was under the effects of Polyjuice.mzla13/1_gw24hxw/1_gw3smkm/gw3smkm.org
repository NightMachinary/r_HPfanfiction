Well yes but it is feasible that the potion includes mustle memory and changes neuron pathways by literally rewiring your body, to the way the other person has it, your brain already has to change in size when shifting between genders or people of the same gender with a bug difference in height, so no reason to assume you retain anything other than your long and short term memory.

This would also fit with the common Tonks headcanon since she lacks the muscle memory as a whole from shifting too often.
