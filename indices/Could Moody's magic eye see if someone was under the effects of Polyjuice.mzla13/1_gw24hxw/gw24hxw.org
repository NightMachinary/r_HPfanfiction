I agree with [[/u/Key-Leopard-3618][u/Key-Leopard-3618]] that polyjuice changes the actual body, and thus there is nothing to see through. Moody's eye, it appears to me, sees through PHYSICAL barriers (even an enchanted cloak is, after all, a physical cloak). It's more likely that his skills as a paranoid auror would help him spot it.

One thing canon doesn't go into but should, is that morphing into a completely different body should require a period of adjustment to be able to "drive" that body. If you're used to shorter arms, for example, you're going to knock over a lot of glasses just trying to take a drink. Of if you're used to longer legs you might try to take stairs two at a time, but your new shorter legs can't reach so you trip. Harry will probably have a habit of pushing his glasses up, that will seem strange in a body that doesn't wear glasses. Or somebody with long hair who has a habit of tossing their head might retain that habit even with shorter hair.

Spotting habits (like Barty's tongue thing) would require a knowledge of the person in question. If the person is going in and out of polyjuice, and interacting with Moody in both forms, perhaps he would note a physical habit like drumming fingers. (Or maybe as an Easter egg, you can have somebody polyjuiced into Harry have Daniel Radcliffe's habit of tapping the wand against his leg.)
