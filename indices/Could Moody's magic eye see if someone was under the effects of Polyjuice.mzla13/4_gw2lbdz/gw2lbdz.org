It's not said if the eye can see beyond anything but spells, charms, physical objects.. Potions are not mentioned, but I think you can invent something. I think that this eye (vision) has counterparts for each sense. With that said, maybe some potions and potions' remains can be identified by sight sometimes, due to some effect, idk, glowing, blur, sepia effect etc. But some can't, instead it's through smell or hearing. Or so, a special nose may give someone the ability to tell if someone is an animagus or werewolf... Now I'm conjecturing....
