Well, I don't think I've read a single "quality" story with any of those pairings involved in it, but the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/][DLP 5-Starred and Featured Authors C2]] takes the most highly rated stories (and sometimes other stories from authors with a known habit for producing quality) from a very discerning community and lumps them all together in one location.

Once you've gotten through all of the stories in the C2 and if you find your tastes to be similar to what's in there, check out the Dark Lord Potter forums for all of the stories that didn't quite make a 5 star rating but ended up in the library. Some of them are still excellent.

Once you finish with THAT, the typical progression seems to be writing your own story, or moving on to the Naruto and Dresden Files fandoms - but fair warning, you can devour those in their entirety within a good couple of months. Once again, the Dark Lord Potter forums has links to the best of the best in those fandoms.
