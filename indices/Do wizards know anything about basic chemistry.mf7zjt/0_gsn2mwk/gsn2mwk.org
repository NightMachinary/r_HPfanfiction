Outside of some "odd ones" (a Muggleborn who kept studying the subject, or a passionate Pure Blood similar to Arthur Weasley), it is same to assume that the vast majority of the Wizards don't know anything about basic chemistry, mainly because they have absolutely no need for it.

In Canon, "Magic" is mainly conceptual and completely ignore "Muggle Science". So why bother learning about the Periodic Table when you can transfigure an item into anything you could want. Why bother transfiguring the air around your target into something flamable, when you have spell able to ignite absolutely everything (including your target). Why bother trying to conjure "mustard gas" when there is probably a "poisonous gas" spell around which is times easier to learn for similar effects.

In the end, Wizards probably already have spell able to reach a similar effect to any chemical reaction you could think of. Which make Science pretty much useless in the Magical world outside of some very specific scenario.

There is also the problem of "Magic" following a different set of rules compared to science. As an example, a simple "Shield Charm" can block a thrown rock just as easily as it can stop a bullet. A fire started with Transfigured Hydrogen would still be a "Muggle Fire" without any magic behind it, which means that it can be easily controled with an appropriate spell, contrary to something like "Fiendfyre" which is basically instoppable.
