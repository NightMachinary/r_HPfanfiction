It's a gender neutral term for magical humans that I've seen occasionally here.

When I talk about magicals I tend to prefer to just use that term, 'magicals', to refer to any being capable of magic. But sometimes, as is the case here, I was specifically referring to magical humans; and while I could use that term instead of wix, using it feels more cumbersome. If nothing else it is far less cumbersome than using 'Witch/Wizard' (or the inverse).
