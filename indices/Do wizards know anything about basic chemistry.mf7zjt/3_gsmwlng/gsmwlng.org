Based on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_chemistry]] if we assume that the wizarding world as a whole largely ignores the non-magical sciences; then it's likely that most wix would have less than primary school (that being, under 11 years old) knowledge of chemistry.

The only exceptions to that likely being Potioneers and Alchemists.

Of course that wouldn't stop any particular magical from learning this stuff, and it'd make sense that at least some will have used this in ways you and others have mentioned. But as a whole, no, most wix (particularly magically raised ones) will likely not think to exploit basic physics and chemistry to their advantage.
