[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15760_Albion][15760 Albion]] (!) is a 1992 discovery. IAU made their resolution in 2006, but the journey there picks up much earlier.

Between that, and the facts about Pluto itself, which don't depend on what anyone calls it, it's workable.

Pluto's wikipedia page captures much of the history, so a dedicated writer could take care to use 1990s approximations, e.g. for Pluto's radius and mass.
