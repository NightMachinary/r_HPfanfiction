I /could/ seee Hermione keeping up with Muggle sciences and also argue that "Pluto cannot be a planet. Or, if if was, there at least should be other objects in our solar system that right now are not called planets but should be defined as planets too. Otherwise we are inconsistent with definitions and how they are used."

I wonder, was Pluto ever used in divination in canon? The centaurs seem to use stars and planets that are visible with the naked eye to make their divinations, and Trelawney seems to be more into things like tea leaves and dreams.
