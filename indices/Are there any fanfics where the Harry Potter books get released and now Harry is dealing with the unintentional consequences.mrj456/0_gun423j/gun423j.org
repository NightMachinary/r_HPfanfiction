The closest fics I'm aware of are linkffn(The Girl of Steel and the Silver Speedster by mysteryman10000) and linkffn(The Lightning-Struck Soldier by TheUnHolySmirk). They're both Supergirl crossovers where Harry ends up in the Supergirl universe, where the Harry Potter books exist because Rowling can subconsciously see into his universe (it's an idea that exists in Supergirl canon, as far as I can tell).

In both stories, Harry does have to deal with people who know a lot about his life, but the details aren't exactly always accurate. And the people who find out that their favorite fictional character is real tend to make a bigger deal out of it than he does.

They're also both pretty safe to read fandom-blind. I have a decent general knowledge of DC comics, but I knew nothing about the Supergirl series before reading them, and I was still able to enjoy them.
