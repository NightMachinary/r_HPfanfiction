  Or: if all the seven books happened in Harry's first year.

That will cause some scenes to become even more dubious. I mean, you can probably shoehorn the first 4 books into one (mysterious corridor, Slytherin's monster, Sirius escaped, TWT), but the later ones get very questionable. For example, whoever ends up giving Harry potioned candy is a child molester and not just a wannabe rapist.

The romances stop working since all you can realistically sell is puppy love. And the Hunt would destroy everyone's suspension of disbelief.
