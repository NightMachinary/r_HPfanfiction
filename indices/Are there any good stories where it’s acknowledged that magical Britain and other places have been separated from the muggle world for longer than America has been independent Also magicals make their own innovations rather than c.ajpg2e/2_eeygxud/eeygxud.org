I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/Victoria-Potter][Victoria Potter by Taure]] has some of the best arts and music innovations I've read in fanfiction. There's a scene where Victoria attends a play of Lockhart's Break with a Banshee that's pretty amazing and really highlights the differences between Muggle and Magical entertainment. Usually fanfiction regards movies as an amazing example of the superiority of Muggle entertainment so it's nice to see the reverse. linkffn(12713828)
