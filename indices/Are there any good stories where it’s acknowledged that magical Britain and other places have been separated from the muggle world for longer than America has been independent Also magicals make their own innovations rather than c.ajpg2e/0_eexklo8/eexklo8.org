As far as I know all of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5's]] Fics have the first part in the worldbuilding, with the wizarding side of the Americas being a lawless place constantly at war with itself, the idea being most magical countries are offshoots of whatever muggle country was there when the Statute of Secrecy went into effect. The Americas didn't have a european style government when the SoS went into effect so is constantly being fought for by various enclaves of wizards.

 

The second part is hard, because to have a world where inventions are different the author has to basically invent them in their mind and most authors don't have the ability to do that. The best I can do is Starfox5's depiction of wizarding fashion in Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron]]). I thought that it /felt/ like how fashion would be if you didn't have to worry about pesky things like: "structural integrity", "keeping warm", or those /"laws of physics"/.
