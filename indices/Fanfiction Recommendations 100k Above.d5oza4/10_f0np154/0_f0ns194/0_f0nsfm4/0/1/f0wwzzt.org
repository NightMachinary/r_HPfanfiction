as for stargate, one series i'm rather fond of is the XSG-Com series by Hotpoint. the best version (meaning, edited) is on Twisting the Hellmouth. it's a Stargate/X-Com crossover. where the Asgard Loki is one behind the Sectoids and other aliens attacking earth. there's three stories in the series, iirc, with the latest one being set in the Pegasus Galaxy and they just woke up an ancient enemy of the Alterans, the Aquatoids. damn good read, though he hasn't updated much in years now.

personally, my favorites from him are New California Dreaming (a Fallout story set in the capital wasteland with an OC NCR Ranger related to the Chosen One being sent to do recon on what the hell the Brotherhood is doing out east, set a few months before the Lone Wanderer leaves the vault) and the Compelled series, a Buffy the Vampire Slayer/Angel The Series story that heavily focuses on Illyria.
