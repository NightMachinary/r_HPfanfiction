i'll probably give the last two a shot at some point, but i loathe SGU, so the first one is out. i think my first introduction was a HP/SG-1 crossover where Harry winds up being possessed by Klorel before eventually gaining his freedom. it was written by Shezza. managed to hunt down a copy of it a couple of years ago (found it on a yahoo group since he deleted it from his profile). it...didn't live up to my memories of it, or my expectations of his work.

speaking of which, i highly recommend Shezza's Denarian series. it's a HP/Dresden Files crossover.
