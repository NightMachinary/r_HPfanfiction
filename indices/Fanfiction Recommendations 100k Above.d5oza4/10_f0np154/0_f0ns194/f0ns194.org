I read quite a bit of that. The premise is definitely an interesting one, especially with all the crossovers, and the starting point, Nightmares of Futures Past, is one of my favorites (which is how I found the Lone Traveler).

I eventually stopped because the story was becoming repetitive. Note that dunuelos is a fan of robst, so expect very competent goblins and eventual god-mode Harry.
