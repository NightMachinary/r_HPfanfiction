Yea, the dating did bug me, a bit, but not enough not to read it. It's not my all time favorite fic on anything, but it's well written and unique. You think â€˜goblin raised Harry' and only really that one comes to mind, for me.

But I can see why people wouldn't like it. That's also why I didn't directly link it, but just mentioned it. The same, I feel, is true for the Firebird series. It's a much more alien magical world. And I considered not linking The Queen Who Fell To Earth because of its slash, polygamy vibes, but idk, I did anyways, I guess.

Again and Again was linked by OP, so clearly slash doesn't matter for this list.
