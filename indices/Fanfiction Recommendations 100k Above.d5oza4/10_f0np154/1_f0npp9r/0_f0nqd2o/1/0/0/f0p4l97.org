Personally my problems with it is it's a feel good fic ie nothing bad happens to the maincharacters, goblins can't have wands so they make a knife that's basically a wand, better transfiguration, â€œgoblins just want to be equals, Harry and co tend to god mode stuff, incompetent evil manipulative dumbledore, I don't remember exactly when but 11/12 year olds dating and essentially wanting to be married,
