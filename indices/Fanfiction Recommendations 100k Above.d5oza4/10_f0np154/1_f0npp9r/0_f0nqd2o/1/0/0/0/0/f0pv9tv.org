It's not well written. It's horribly written. The only thing it has going for it is it's length and uniqueness. It doesn't compare to good HP fanfics in plot or story telling. It's just a giant wish fulfillment power wank lol. The first few chapters had everyone acting like a dick and Harry being awesome because he's goblin raised and making people like Dumbledore and Snape look stupid and amatuerish. What a dumb fic.
