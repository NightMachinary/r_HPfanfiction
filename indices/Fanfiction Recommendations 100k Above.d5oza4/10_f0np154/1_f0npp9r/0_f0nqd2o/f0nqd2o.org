And I'm a personal fan of the Queen Who Fell To Earth trilogy as well.

And I could go on, but I guess that's enough for now. I've got a dozen or more between 100k-400k words, that I can link if you want, but some of them are suspicious in their absence here already. Where is Core Threads, A Discordant Note, Make A Wish, Harry Crow, the Firebird Trilogy? Heck, MoR?
