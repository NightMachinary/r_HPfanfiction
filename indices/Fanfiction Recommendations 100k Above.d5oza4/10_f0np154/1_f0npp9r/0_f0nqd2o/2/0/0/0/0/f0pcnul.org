RobSt, especially in his earlier works, has a number of problematic tendencies that rub a vocal portion of this subreddit wrong. He's a very /clumsy/ writer, with a tendency to tell rather than show; many of his characters are sock puppets spouting exposition rather than actual people. He has a number of personal axes to grind, especially against Dumbledore and the Weasleys, that also grate (although to be fair, there are also readers who love Weasley and Dumbledore bashing and can't get enough of it).

Personally, I find most of his stories readable and enjoyable, in a 'potato chip fic' fashion; quickly consumed, quickly disregarded. Some of them are borderline untouchable - Harry Crow fits that category for me. Knowledge is Power was also horribly clumsy, but he's currently reworking it as Proud Parents and I thought it was decent.

As with any fic, everyone's mileage varies. Read what you like, and to hell with the haters.
