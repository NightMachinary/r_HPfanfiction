Ah, I can see it. I agree with the â€˜potato chip fic' idea. I wouldn't want to go back and reread Harry Crow any time soon, but it was interesting while it lasted. Same with MoR, really. I like it for its uniqueness, in exploring a situation no other fics really did, but I can see what you mean with its weaknesses aswell.

Though I'm happy to agree to disagree on the details.
