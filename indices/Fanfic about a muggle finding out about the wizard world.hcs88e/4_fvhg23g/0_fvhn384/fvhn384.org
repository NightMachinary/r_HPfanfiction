There's something I read aaaaages ago where Harry was originally living on the streets after running away from the Dursleys and an older girl also living on the streets adopts him as a sort of little brother. Because she's so protective and everything, and is basically his family, she gets to know about the wizarding world when he gets his letter and they let her go to Hogwarts for her own safety where she learns basic potions, Arithmancy and Runes because they don't require a wand. There's a particularly lovely scene where she's got a portkey to the school, and she's just dropped Harry off for the train and wants to pass as a "real witch" so while activating the portkey she spins as if she's apparating.

Is that more the kind of thing?
