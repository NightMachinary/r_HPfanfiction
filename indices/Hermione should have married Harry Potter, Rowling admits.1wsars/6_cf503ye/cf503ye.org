I always suspected that she wanted to be Harry and Hermione at the begining. Because book 1 to 4 it seems that they would be a cuple. Come on, everyone thought this when the were flying on Buckbeak.

But suddenly in book 5 (or was the 6, not sure now) Harry is head over heels for Ginny.

And I always thought that she put Hermione with Ron because he would be alone. And I always sorry for her.

If only she could rewrite the books :/
