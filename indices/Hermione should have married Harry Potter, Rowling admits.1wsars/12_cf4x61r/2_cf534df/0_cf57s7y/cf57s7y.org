Yes, but a tad more extreme than that. Those three were basically family at that point. They've been together through thick and thin, and are brothers in arms. The way I see it, there are two trios in the war (Neville-Luna-Ginny being the second), and thankfully, at least two of those six didn't get married to one another... it just makes it seem like war forced those six together, and they're just stuck that way.

It feels more like the war decided their life with the pairings between those six, which is kind of sad.
