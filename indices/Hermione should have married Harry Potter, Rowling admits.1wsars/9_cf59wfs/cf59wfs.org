I feel so vindicated that I am afraid it is just a troll.

This seems too easy, like it might be a twitter publicity stunt to sell more issues. That JKR never said anything like this, though possibly Emma has given it thought and asked her about it.

edit: Yes, I have long admitted that having the PenName "ginnymylove" makes me being a Harmonian rather strange. But I defend it by wanting Harry to get both; plus I was barely into fanfic when I came up with the name, and now I'm kinda stuck with it unless I want to go back to being unknown.
