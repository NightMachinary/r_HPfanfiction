I prefer to take almost everything an author says with a pinch of salt, and with JKR it's usually a big pinch of salt because some thing's just don't fit with me, and I agree that this is a huge change. I don't really care, in all honestly, because I sit on the fence re: H/Hr vs. Hr/R, but I have to disagree that announcing Dumbledore is gay is a major change. What she's announced here changes the books in a big way if she'd actually written it, but AD being gay doesn't.
