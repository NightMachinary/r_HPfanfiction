Honestly, I don't really think that makes much sense either. Developing it or not, the characters were completely different. Opposites might attract for sex, but I can't imagine actually marrying someone who's basically my polar opposite.

The relationship never made much sense, beyond the fact that people really wanted it while reading the series.
