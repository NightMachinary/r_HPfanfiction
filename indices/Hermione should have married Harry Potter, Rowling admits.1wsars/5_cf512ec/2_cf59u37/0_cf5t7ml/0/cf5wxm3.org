Myself and a large number of people I know, believe she probably had a ghost writer for the last 3 books. That she gave them her notes and said "we must hit all of these plot points".

Explains a lot of the out-of-character stuff that happened after 5th year.

I also believe that Ginny was supposed to have put Harry on a love potion to "catch his attention" the same way that Molly did Arthur, but that someone pointed out to her that it was a bit rapey. Possible that it was moved to Merope/Tom Sr, or that it was supposed to be a mirror-life situation which made him realize what was happening.

Not that he would have broken it off with her once he did notice her, just for using a potion. I doubt it would have been Amortentia ... I prefer Harry/Hermione, but I still love a good Ginny in fanfiction and I hate when people feel they have to make her evil Potions!Ginny!Slut in order to justify putting him with someone else.
