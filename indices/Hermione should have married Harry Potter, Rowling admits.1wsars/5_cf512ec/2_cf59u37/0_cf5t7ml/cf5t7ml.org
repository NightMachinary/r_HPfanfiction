Thing is, after the fans grew up reading it, it wasn't really a children's story any longer. If you're writing a story that you know 16 and 17-year-olds (and older) will be reading, even if they were pre-teens when they read the first book in the series, then you can't pawn off bad romance and weak character development as "just a children's story." The last three books were clearly Young Adult fiction, at least as classified in the US public library system when I was growing up.

JKR let a lot of people down with some of her late series writing decisions, leading directly to HP fanfiction being the scariest, largest fanfic community in the world. I'm glad she realized some of this and is finally admitting it after years of denial.

Personally, I think she panicked in GoF (when a publicly admitted delay and rewrite happened) and at that point she changed several things, including the inevitably cheesy budding romance plotline, which was clearly developing between Harry and Hermione. But there is no way she'll admit to that, I'm sure.
