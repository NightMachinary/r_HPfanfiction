There's a great wealth of Remus/Sirius, and also some Remus/Hermione here and there (mostly time-travel).

Some people think Tonks, with her clumsiness and "pop" attitude, is just annoying, and a poor match for Remus as a great wizard (he /did/ cocreate the /Marauder's Map/ and all Marauders were considered bright students), the Best Defence Professor^{TM} , and a Tortured Romantic Soul^{TM} .
