I have this personal headfanon that 'magical core theory' is the pureblood supremacists' version of lysenkoism, or welteislehre, or supply-side economics. Every pernicious political ideology needs an /ex ano/ pseudo-intellectual theory-wank to its name, and 'magical cores' are what the anti-muggle racists picked for theirs.
