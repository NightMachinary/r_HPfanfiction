"Oh, Merlin, some idiot failed his exams at 256th mile from here, It's all my fault". The moment he says "it's all my fault" to every random thing, I just close the tab. I mean he comes a arrogant and whiny at the same time. Arrogant enough to think that he can solve everything, Like in many stories he says some thing like " I should have been in Hogwarts in 7th year, then none of this torture could have happened, it's all my fault". This statement disrespects the DA and rebellion, as if they aren't done anything. Also multiple Lordships in the first chapter itself, too nice goblins, everyone is here for his money, and he has 1,000000000000 galleons in his account, pairing with every female in his sight.
