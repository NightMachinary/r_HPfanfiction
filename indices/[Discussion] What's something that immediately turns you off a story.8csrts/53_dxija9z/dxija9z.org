I love good Hermione/Snape fanfictions, but I HATE when authors mention him realizing she is "all grown up" (this, and curves in the right places, womanly figure, not a girl but a woman, etc.). You can't just force a romantic intrigue between a young character and an older one by making the old one realize the young isn't that young looking anymore, it's just gross. My favorite Snape/Hermione fics usually take place years after Hogwarts for this reason, or with some kind of time turner magic involved. Same for any other Hermione/older guy fics actually.

Oh, and I really hate when I find a decently long fic and find out that the romance starts in chapter 3. I want them to be friends first, then maybe something will develop... They've talked twice and suddenly they're in bed withe each other ? Come on. It's chapter 3, there's 40 chapters left, couldn't they have taken a bit more time ? I usually close the fic when it happens, unless the plot seems very very good and there's a great adventure-action story in these 40 remaining chapters.
