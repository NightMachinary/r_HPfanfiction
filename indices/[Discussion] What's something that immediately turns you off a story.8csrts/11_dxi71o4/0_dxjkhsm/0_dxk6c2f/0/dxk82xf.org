I meant in the way that Harry makes friends, has fun, etc. etc. in the books. I think I read somewhere else that realistically, the Dursley's treatment of him would leave him either isolated and withdrawn or very, /very/ angry at the world.

Instead it seems to me, from what I remember from the books, that save for the whole Boy-Who-Lived thing, he has an emotionally normal childhood when he's at Hogwarts.
