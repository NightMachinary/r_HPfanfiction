  Also, Mrs Weasley seemed pretty strict on underage magic, and we did see here do non-verbal magic before the Quidditch World Championship.

Those are marvellous rationalisations, which I don't agree on at all (Ron has older brothers, who are adults and surely cast some spells when they came home after 6th/7th year)... but even if I accept such rationalisations Ron is still a huge idiot for casting a spell, that he doesn't even know he can cast, without testing it beforehand and without knowing that it is even a real spell in front of his would be friends in order to impress them. Compare that to Hermione, who cast a spell that she found in an actual book and actually tried to cast before. That's like basic common sense. If I were an observer to that scene in the compartment I'd have wondered if Ron is a special needs kid.

That's an amazing recipe to set yourself up for failure. Remember, this is the guy who can't even get Wingardium Leviosa right because he's too dumb to pronounce it correctly and gets mad when someone exposes his stupidity (which is also dumb, because then you will stay dumb because people won't tell you that you're wrong anymore).
