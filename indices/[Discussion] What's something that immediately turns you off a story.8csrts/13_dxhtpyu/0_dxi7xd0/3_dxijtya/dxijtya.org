There's a lot of different magic. For all we know there could be tons of spells that have such incantations. We have Lily's sacrifical magic, the classic Latin + wand movement, the thing Wormtail did to resurrect voldemort, etc.

Also, Mrs Weasley seemed pretty strict on underage magic, and we did see here do non-verbal magic before the Quidditch World Championship.
