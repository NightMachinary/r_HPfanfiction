  No , that isn't at all a charitable interpretation. This kid is jealous of his famous, rich, sports hero best friend but only shows it once every couple of years (here where his buddy gets into what they thought would be super awesome tournament) --- I think he shows a lot of restraint actually.

I don't really understand how that's any more charitable? How does believing that Harry would enter himself and - even more ridiculous - then lie about it not make Ron a giant idiot? It's completely out of character for Harry. Ron knows this.

In any case, I'd personally vastly prefer a stupid but genuine friend over someone who stabs me in the back even though he knows better. I'm extremely charitable to Ron by assuming he's an oaf.
