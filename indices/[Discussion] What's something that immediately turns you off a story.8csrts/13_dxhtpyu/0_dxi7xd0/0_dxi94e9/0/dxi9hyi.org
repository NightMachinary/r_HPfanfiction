  People think he was behind in classes because he complained, but he wasn't . All with the handicap of using a hand me down wand for the first two years.

I wonder how well he would have done without copying from Hermione all the time.

But you're right, the Twins are very clever, it just stretches belief that an 11 year old would fall for that. Or that he believes he would have to wrestle a troll. I'd expect your average 7-8 year old to find all of that a little dubious... in particular since the twins have a history of pulling pranks.

But I have a bit more in my sack of "Ron is really kind of dumb" examples. What about the Triwizard? How dumb do you have to be to genuinely believe Harry would have entered himself in the tournament and then lie about it to his best friends? That's the most charitable interpretation of Ron's character here. Because if he didn't actually believe that he's just a spiteful little fuck.
