The Twins are amateur spellcrafters, and we know spell incantations /can/ be in English (cf. /Point-Me/), so while on the bizarre side, I don't think that spell was quite as preposterous as it may seem. In the films, Seamus Finnegan's clumsy attempt at spellcrafting follows a similar structure of an overly-long English incantation, and while it doesn't /work/, it produces a magical backfire, implying it is a genuine magic spell, just a badly-designed one. The Resurrection Ritual's incantation was also in English and multi-line, for something more substantial, although admittedly some people make rituals to be something entirely different from spells.
