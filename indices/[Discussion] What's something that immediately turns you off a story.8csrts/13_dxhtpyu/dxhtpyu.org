Ron bashing. If you don't like him, give him a tiny role, don't make him a drooling moron.

Uber wise Luna. She was an oddball, not an oracle.

Beautiful , brilliant, flawless Hermione plus any barely-fleshed our boy. I get it, it's teen girls writing a fantasy , But it's not interesting for me to read.

House bashing of the uncool houses .
