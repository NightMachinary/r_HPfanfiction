I agree/disagree. A Dumbledore who has legitimate difficulty with a decision and ends up justifying it to himself by saying "for the greater good" isn't immidiately terrible.

I'll give it to you, most aren't worth looking twice at but my favorite Dumbledore is one struggling with his guilt and trying to choose the best option from a list of bad options.
