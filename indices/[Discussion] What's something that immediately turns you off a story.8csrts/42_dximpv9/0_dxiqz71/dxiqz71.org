You surprise me. Most people who have travelled before /dearly wish/ they had an infinite-size trunk to pack /all/ of their favorite stuff in, or even a portable house to avoid unfamiliar hotels and just be at home even when they're camping out in the jungles of Borneo.

My point is, the wish-fulfillment appeal that makes Dimensional Trunks so popular in fanfiction is evidence enough that, actually, a very large number of people /would/ love to own one.

What seems more reasonable to me if you want to avoid Dimensional Trunks --- and by all means do --- then make them what they are: incredibly expensive luxury items, of the sort that you either enchant yourself in your garage (which I think is what Moody did) or that you would have to spend half your Potter Fortune to get.
