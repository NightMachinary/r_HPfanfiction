Scamender /did/ get rich, but only later in life --- IIRC, he hadn't written the book yet during the events of the film. Note how everybody treats him like a nobody. Grindelwald would surely know him by reputation if he were already a millionaire writer, and thus not squander such a valuable life just to maintain his Percival Graves disguise. Not to mention the diplomatic issues involved if MACUSA summarily executed one of Magical Britain's foremost scholars.

So good thinking, but it probably doesn't work. Perhaps he had a family fortune instead?
