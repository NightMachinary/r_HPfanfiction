  I really hate emotional harry. He doesn't scream often in canon, yet some fanfic authors make screaming his #1 reaction to everything.

While I agree that a raging Harry is no fun, having him show some emotion isn't bad. To use an example from one of my stories, if Harry get's a family, then it's ok when there's a scene dealing with homesickness and probably Harry's confusion about the entire thing because he never had someplace besides Hogwarts to be homesick about. But at the same time, it should be used with caution, since having every other scene deal with a mopey Harry isn't good either. I feel like most authors are too quick in resorting to extremes. A little moderation would be good.

For example, Ron was an arse to Hermione around the Yule Ball. Having Hermione hold that against him (she can hold a grudge for a looooong time, just ask Crouch Sr) makes it a realistic portrayal of her character. Hell, it could end their friendship permanently. But having Ron join the Death Eaters because he wants to "put that Mudblood back in her place" is just pointless bashing.
