Too many damn things to name, really. I mean I won't read slash, mpreg, bashing, you have be able to write decently. Good detail, logical emotions.

I really hate authors dumbing characters down to make one character in particular appear smart. This happens a lot in Luna fics. Everyone around Luna is an idiot and their #1 response is "What?" and to stare blankly at her.

like if the topic of a conversation is which truck someone should buy and Luna comes along and says "Ford" - everyone around looks at her as if her response is so brilliant that is needs additional explaining.

I really hate emotional harry. He doesn't scream often in canon, yet some fanfic authors make screaming his #1 reaction to everything. !Evil characters which fall into the bashing category. Everyone wants to make Dumbledore the villain but they can't write a decent villain to save their lives.

99% of Gringotts scenes. I do not give a damn about anyone's will. Not anymore. I do not give a damn that Harry's "core" is "65% Blocked" (Like WTF?!) or that you want to give him every ability under the sun that he will NEVER USE. I'm sick and tired of helpful goblins, dumb adults, and fanfic authors thinking that everything that Harry does is "cunning" and have other characters stare at his god-like cunning in absolute amazement like "OMG! Such cunning,. Much Slytherin!".

Used to be into Harem fics, they're shit.

Draco/Hermione. Snape/Lily. Severitus. Muggle wank. Reverse discrimination/bigotry (People bashing purebloods and magical culture).

Yeah, probably more.

Just please give me a few more good Harry/Fleur fics. De-age her if required. Just...please.
