I have issues, if I start reading a fic, I feel compelled to finish it. That said, here are the things that make finishing exceptionally painful...

If you are going to write HPFF, please for the love of JKR know what the spells do. Did you really just have someone cast silencio so the characters aren't overheard? Cause that's not how this works... There aren't all that many spells in canon, use them (and spell them) properly. And if you are going to create a new spell, don't give me some long ass description in the author's notes about the etymology of the spell. You should have just shown me what the spell does, I don't need an additional explanation.

If your author's notes are as long as the chapter, I will think hateful things.

Muggle technology doesn't work at Hogwarts. And no, your Mary Sue didn't come up with a work around their first year.

Fleur is awesome and smart and brave af. Stop trying to make her a daft bimbo.
