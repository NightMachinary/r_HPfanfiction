1) Overpowered characters. If I read a fic where Harry/Hermione/Main Character is casting advanced charms on the first train ride to Hogwarts, I quit. If they already know it -- well, what's the point in going to school at all? And if magic's so easy -- why have school at all? If your system of magic is basically repeating a spell-phrase and, voila, magic happens, than any monkey can do it. Inevitably, these sorts of fics devolve into Harry/Hermione/Main Character eviscerating waves of swarming Death Eaters like firebats burning through zerglings, which creates absolutely zero tension and is not fun.

2) Mugglewank. Harry Potter is set in a /magical/ world. With /wizards/ and /witches/. It's supposed to be /magical/. So, please, get your microwaves, your coffeemakers, and your stupid flatscreen tv's that all purebloods suddenly fall for, away from here. Imagine something special! Something new and original! Make me love a /magical/ world, not confront the mundane stuff I see every day.
