  If I read a fic where Harry/Hermione/Main Character is casting advanced charms on the first train ride to Hogwarts, I quit. If they already know it -- well, what's the point in going to school at all?

Agreed. I made light fun of that trope in /Parselmouth/ by having an overconfident, well-read Hermione /try/ to use the Summoning Charm to find Trevor... and utterly fail to produce anything of value, as expected.
