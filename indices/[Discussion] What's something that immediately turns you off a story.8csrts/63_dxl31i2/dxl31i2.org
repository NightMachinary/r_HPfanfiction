For me, besides the usual spelling and grammar stuff.

1) Having Hermione or Ginny as a romantic partner for Harry. I have no clue why, but it just bothers me, even if by all rights, either would be a good partner for harry

2) Harem fics, both because they're generally not that well written, and because they usually have Ginny and/or Hermione in them.

3) Pretty much anything set during the Hogwarts years that turns Harry OP/Cynical, which is really weird because one of my favorite story types is OP/Cynical Harry doing stuff after his Hogwarts years.

4) Soul bond, full stop.

5) Full on Bashing. Not playing up character flaws more than they were in canon, or applying fridg logic to some of the things that happen in cannon, but full on this person is a strait up slimy fuck bashing.
