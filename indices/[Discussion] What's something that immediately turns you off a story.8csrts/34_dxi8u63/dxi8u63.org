Somehow changing multiple plot points, making people immensely OoC compared to canon, and turning Harry into the same shitty indy crap starting setup with the shopping spree and apparently inevitable point of all the goblins trying to shower him with a nice fawning tongue-bath, and then for some reason I still genuinely do not understand at all, they make the story conform to the exact same story line as canon. Insult Malfoy, fight a troll, kill a basilisk, time turning gibberish, and as always, inevitably get dragged through the Triwizard with varying degrees of competence to end up lashed and shrieking in a graveyard, which ironically is how just about all of these shitty stories also end up. Apparently new and exciting ideas and experiences are obviously far too scary to make it worth writing about, but this happens so much that these days I will only spend maybe a month or 2 on any fandom, find the cream that has risen to the top recently and revisit some old favourites, but if you just watch the top stuff being read consistently I burn out on the 90% idea-recycling-machine it seems to be.

Oh yeah, and mpreg is always shit.
