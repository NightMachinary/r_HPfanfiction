When they build the character to be a certain way like idk smart, and then they have a chapter where he's faced with something big like a fight or ,something and he does the dumbest fucking thing ever like the absolutely stupidest thing, and the only reason it happens is because the author needed this thing to happen and couldn't write it in a way that fit the character that they had so far built.

Also when they make Harry super powerful and give him a bunch of powers and he learns martial arts or some Shit and becomes a dragon animagus but then only uses one or basic spells. They could make these great battle scenes but nope it's one two simple spells and he wins doesn't use anything else that has been talked up the whole story. Also why is it always a damn katana that they pull out like come on. ( I actually like most of the powerful or godlike fics idk just something about a badass powerful Harry is cool as long as the author makes it work, by that I mean it's gotta keep me wondering about what's gonna happen next not just have me quit half way through because I know who he gets with and that he wins in depth imaginative battles help instead of just "Harry threw a couple stupifys dodged and repeated untill the enemy ran away" it's hard to find one like that though. )

There's more but I can't think of them right now I'm sure they will the next time I read a fanfic that causes them though hahaha.
