For me it's usually horrible writing style. I understand that like 99.99999% of fanfic authors aren't professional writers and I cant hold them to that standard. But if a fic reads like an 11 year old wrote it then I'm out.

Being stupidly over powered with no reason, if it's a time travel/soul going back in time fic and the character is over powered then sure it's probably reasonable, but if it's a normal fic and harry is throwing up wards and stunning people on his first train trip to Hogwarts then I'm out.

Rehashing the books. Making harry a girl but repeating the books word for word other than changing names and pronouns is not a fic, it's just stupid.

Strong OOC without a reason really gets me. It's a magical world, come up with a reason for Snape to suddenly be not an asshole, or for Tonks to fall in love with Harry. Damn love potion or a spell or something, you can do lots with a magical world at your fingertips so just throw in a few paragraphs to explain your weird OOC!

An over crowded plot really annoys me. Make a good plot with a few sub plots and it will keep everyone interested, but if you have 3 or 4 main plots going on with 30 subplots all at one time then it's just to much going on, it's not realistic!

Climbing up on a soapbox and preaching your ideas and views. I come to fanfic to escape my world for a while and relax, I don't need weird psudoscience or politics messing that up! I'm looking at you rational thought fic I can't remember the name of!
