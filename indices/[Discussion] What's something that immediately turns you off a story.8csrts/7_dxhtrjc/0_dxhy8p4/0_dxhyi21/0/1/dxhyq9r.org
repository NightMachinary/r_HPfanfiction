To be fair I had just moved to a new city with my fiance. We moved because she got a promotion, and I was in university. So I wasn't working, and wasn't in school until the next semester started, and we didn't have TV or internet for a week after we moved. So I didn't have much to do. We also moved to an apartment above a sweet pub so I was day drunk most of the time. That may have helped me get through it if I'm being honest.
