1. Bashing.
2. Characters being out of character.
3. Adding in fantastical, detailed rules of magical society that somehow never got brought up even once in the books but are somehow incredibly important to everyday life (I'm looking at you, 'I invoke my rights as heir of house potter to place house granger under my protection in an alliance that will be consummated with our marriage as wife number fourteen according to the laws of blood purity')
4. Abusing the loopholes (the many, many loopholes) in magical society left by Rowling to make a character seem more like a genius - especially when that character was never a genius in the books.
5. Bad grammar and spelling.
