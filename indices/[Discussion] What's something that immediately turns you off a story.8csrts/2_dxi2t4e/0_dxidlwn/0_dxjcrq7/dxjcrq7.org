I want to see a fic of Harry learning that his parents are /absolutely normal people,/ with /ordinary flaws/ and /ordinary lives,/ and that just makes him very happy. After all, he was the odd-one out at the Dursleys and at Hogwarts, so the idea that they were normal, simple, loving people would probably mean a lot to him.
