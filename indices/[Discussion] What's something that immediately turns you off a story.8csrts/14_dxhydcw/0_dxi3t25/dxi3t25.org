The "shopping trip" can actually be done really well. For example, in "Call Me", post-OotP Harry decides that he needs a break and goes on a blind date with Lisa Turpin. Some banter later, Lisa asks him if he doesn't want to get some decent clothes, they go to an army surplus store, there's even a mention of underwear, more teasing, and the entire thing is painlessly done in around 1000 words.
