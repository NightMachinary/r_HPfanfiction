Things that will make me leave a fic instantly

1.  Poor sentence/paragraph structure and/or text that is essentially all dialogue with no prose (as I am not a fan of screenplays).

2.  Bad magic. As in magic by physics or science, immature, poorly thought out.

3.  Bashing, for obvious reasons.

4.  Ultra-perfect-genius-goddess Hermione.

5.  Whiny bitch Harry.

6.  Shit Rons.

7.  Any fic that has a Harry yells at Dumbledore for wanting to sacrifice Harry and cast everything aside but also has any of the following: Harry being equally willing to cast morality aside, Dumbledore and the Order being unwilling to kill a bitch (recall /DH/), people behaving as if an eleven year old throwing a temper tantrum is a great example or moment that opens their eyes.

8.  "Prongslet." Because as we all know, the proper term for the child of a stag is calf.

9.  "Marauder names" that don't poke fun at the person it applies to.

10. More annoying than entertaining. This is One Metric to rule them all, One Metric to find them, One Metric to bring them all, and in the reading bind them. I will violate any of the above points if I am sufficiently entertained.
