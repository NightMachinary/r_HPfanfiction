No. Deer is basically a class of animal. For instance, there are red deer (sometimes called harts, though I have seen that as an alternate name for the males) have stags and hinds which have calves ([[http://www.thedeerinitiative.co.uk/uploads/guides/168.pdf][found source]]), mule deer and white-tail deer have bucks and does, moose have bulls and cows (which make calves) and so on and so forth.

Since James Potter's animagus form is called a stag, and red deer are the largest land animal in the UK and James-in-Prongs-form could manhandle a werewolf, I assume his animagus is a red deer. As such, Harry would be his calf.
