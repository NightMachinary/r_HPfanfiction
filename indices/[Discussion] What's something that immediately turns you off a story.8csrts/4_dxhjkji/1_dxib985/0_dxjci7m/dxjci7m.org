There was one fic where Hermione became a literal goddess (or an eldritch abomination, depending on who you asked) and then noped off to somewhere outside the universe while her brain was rebooting, leaving behind a house elf transfigured to look like her in order to keep people from missing her. It's exactly as weird as it sounds and even freaks out people in-universe.

linkffn(Of Wands and Kunai) I believe.

I know it's not what you're talking about with "ultra perfect goddess Hermione," but I couldn't help but think of it.
