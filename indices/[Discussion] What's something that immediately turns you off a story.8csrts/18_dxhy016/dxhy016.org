The biggest one for me is sexism. It suggests to me right off the bat that I'm not going to be interested in where the author's taking this story or characters because it's a base level disrespect to your setting and characters.

So any one of female characters being 1) weepy and useless, 2) self-sacrificing to the point of absurdity, diminishing themselves and their own skills, 3) happy to let super!Harry talk down to them (bad enough when it's say Hermione, /unforgivable/ when it's an older adult like McGonagall or Augusta Longbottom), 4) obviously there to be a pair of boobs with blink-and-you'll-miss-it characterization and a blonde/brunette/redhead/pink wig depending on whether she's Fleur, Hermione, Ginny or Tonks.

Beyond the dullness of it, it just breaks any sense of realism for me; in my several decades on this planet I've never met a girl or woman who would happily behave in those ways and let herself be treated like that, and who would legitimately have /no/ desires of her own whatsoever. Let alone one of the strong-minded female characters from the books behaving like that. The only character I could /just about/ see it from is the much-maligned Pansy Parkinson, who for some reason doesn't seem to be a popular character in fics.

EDIT: It says a lot about how the fanfiction community's changed in this last 10-15 years that this post has had fluctuating up and downvotes. I find that interesting, personally. I'll have to look and see if there are any studies into that kind of thing.
