Absolutely.

I would even say that's what makes it so egregious; attitudes coming from characters like Harry, Ron etc. who live in a society that is shown to be historically /more/ equitable between men and women (female high up politicians, school founders, inventors, sportswomen etc.) than muggle society of the time, written by authors who live in our modern society, just don't have any grounds to stand on to be acting like that, if it's not knowing and self-aware.
