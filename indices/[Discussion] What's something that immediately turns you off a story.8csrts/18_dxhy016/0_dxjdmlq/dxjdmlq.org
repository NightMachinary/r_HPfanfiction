A caveat to that: sexist behavior has been fading for the last hundred years, but if you rewind 20-30 years /and/ feature an isolationed, explicitly-outdated society, a bit of in-universe sexism is not out of place, even if it's frowned upon by the audience.

Sexism on a meta level (within the narration or the plot, and not explicitly associated with one sexist character) is, quite obviously, not acceptable. The distinction is the first is a character in a historical context being a bastard within universe (which doesn't reflect the author's opinion), while the other is the author himself being a bastard to his audience. The distinction is critical, for it makes the difference between a good story with vile characters and a vile story.

Regardless, it's best to not be sexist at all. Most fanfic authors don't have the skill to avoid being an asshole, so it's best that they just treate people like people, regardless of gender.
