- Getting proper names wrong: Hermoine, Flich, Fluer, Private Drive, Kinglsey, Slitheryn, Parsleymouth

- Anything else that exposes a "don't care" attitude about writing (for example lack of internal consistency and ridiculous plot contrivances).

- Consistently bad writing: This is fanfiction, I'm fine with the occasional error or head-hopping, but if you prove to me that you really don't understand what 3rd person limited is or how a story works in the most basic terms I'm out.

- Canon rehash: I can deal with repeating some of the stations of canon, but the story can't revolve around the same mysteries. I already know that it's a Basilisk, that Sirius is innocent and that Moody is an impostor. These things can all be in a fic, but if they are the main focus/drive it turns me off. All bets are off in an AU/divergence fic: give me reason to belief that maybe it's the real Moody and we're cool.

- Also Fics that aren't AU, but have decidedly OOC characters without reason or explanation. Most notably with Draco and Snape. "Draco is secretly a really nice guy" just won't work after 6th year, arguably even earlier. Especially if it includes "Draco returns to Hogwarts for his NEWTs after the fall of Voldemort" - that's actually insane.

- Next gen fics. All the canon pairings are bad and the epilogue sucks ass. I have zero interest in any story that mentions Albus Severus Potter unironically.

- Creature fics. Just no.

- Personal quirks: I *hate* Romione so I avoid stories with that pairing like the plague. If it isn't tagged and they appear as anything except a very background couple I'll drop the fic immediately. Reading about their UST and how perfectly they compliment each other literally churns my stomach.
