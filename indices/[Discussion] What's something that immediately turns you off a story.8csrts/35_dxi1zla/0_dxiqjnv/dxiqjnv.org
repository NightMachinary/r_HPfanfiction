  Especially if it includes "Draco returns to Hogwarts for his NEWTs after the fall of Voldemort" - that's actually insane.

You surprise me. The first part is indeed ludicrous, but it seems Adult Malfoy cleaned up his act somewhat, and, while never an admirable person, grew out of being a bullying jackass... Swallowing his pride and returning to school after the Battle of Hogwarts because he admits he's not a good enough wizard yet might be spun as the first act of his "adult" life. Not to mention, being /seen/ as doing it might help the population buys that he and his parents are "reformed" --- let's not forget that Malfoy /is/ a Slytherin, little though he acts like it usually.
