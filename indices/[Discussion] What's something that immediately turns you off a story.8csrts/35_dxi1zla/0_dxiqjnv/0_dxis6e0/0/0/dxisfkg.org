Ah, okay! I get you. Sure, if you want to have the pessimistic outlook that Wizarding Britain remains utter shit even after having a second Blood War (because they refused to clean up their society) that makes a bit of sense. I was always of the opinion that Kingsley, Harry, Hermione, etc would be smart enough to realize that Voldemort was a symptom and not repeating the same mistake that was made after the first War.

I still think the protectiveness of parents over children would prevail. Unless you're suggesting that Draco's crimes will not come to light publicly.
