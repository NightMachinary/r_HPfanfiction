No, I'm sorry I'm not going to budge on this. Sure I'm all for Draco cleaning up his act, but if he isn't going to prison (which he should... some kind of juvenile prison, not azkabhan, maybe a Muggle youth detention center would do him good), he would certainly never be allowed on school grounds again. In any kind of parole sentencing that should be the first on the list. He almost killed Ron and Katie and led a bunch of terrorists into the school, who have no compunctions about shooting lethal spells at children or torturing them...

Can you imagine allowing someone who shot up a high school (without fatalities) back on those school grounds ever again so that he can "clean up his act"? No, of course not! That's insane. No parent would stand for it.
