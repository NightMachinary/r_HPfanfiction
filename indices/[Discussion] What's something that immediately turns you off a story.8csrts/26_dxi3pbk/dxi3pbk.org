Power!Harry. stories I'm soooooooo SICK of them.

It's got to the part where I'm reluctant to even read a story where Harry's the main character because I REALLY don't want another story where training or a different childhood or going back in time or whatever turns him into this overpowered Harry Stu who breezes through everything easily and gets all self-righteous and ranty, and blames everyone else for everything that's ever happened to him, because of course HARRY never did ANYTHING wrong and was totally blameless for anything bad that ever happened, and if he ever had any flaws it was never his fault; it's all because Dumbledore or the Wealseys or the Dursleys oppressed him and made him totally less than the flawless and awesome badass he always "really" was and was supposed to be.... but now that he's independent and badass and totally cool, he's not going to take it and he's going to let everyone who isn't perfect like him know that he's through being used, and... UGH. By this time I've usually choked on the massive hypocricy.
