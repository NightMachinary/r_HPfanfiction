•Too many Americanisms. Even if a fic is average, I give it bonus points for sounding authentically British.

•Things that are patently wrong in terms of cannon that they could have checked in the HP lexicon. I'll give it a pass if its information from Pottermore- like James's parents, but if it's something like the age of a Weasley or a plot point it annoys me. For example, I just read a fic where Hermione brings Sirius back from the dead because he owes her a life debt. Life debts can in the logic of the story bring back people who have not been struck with the Killing Curse. It's been a while since I've read the books, but I ertinly remember Sirius was hit with a Killing Curse before falling through the Veil, so I couldn't even continue the story.

•Also, since I read a lot of Marauders fics, I like it when people keep them consistent to the period. I literally just read one where they talk about how ubiquitous /cell phones/ were in Muggle Studies class (never mind that those devices would have still been expensive in the time when the books were set!)
