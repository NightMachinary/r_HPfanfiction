Pedophilia and pedophiles and child prostitution being written in a normal, positive light.

I still can't believe Black Princess gets recommended. I think I somehow missed that Narcissa was a pedo, until further into the story. Then I just had to nope out.

Also, I recently tried out the Minister's Secret, but I just find Hermione too OOC. I cannot believe she goes to the past, and almost instantly starts fucking a future DE, then dates one who almost kills her in the future, then cheats on him with the first, then after the second assaults her, she stays with him. Oh yes, all this without a thought to the man she was with before going back in time, Ron.

So yeah, stories where characters go unbelievably out of character I can't deal with.
