How can you miss that? She recognizes fem!Harry because she went to the child brothel and +slept with her+ raped her. And then she's like: "Oh shit, I didn't realize she was a human being, I thought they were all muggles and they don't count!" ... and Sirius is like: "Cool, welcome to the House of Black, cousin!"
