Any fic that features Snape or Draco as main or sympathetic characters. I hate both to the point of being irrational tbh.

Lord/Lady pureblood bullshit. My eyes roll out of my head and fall into the garbage disposal. Not really, because I still have eyes, but I find the style of writing in these types of fics to be difficult to read. I think my problem with fics using this trope is the Victorian-esque vibe that the writers are trying to create and I'm not sure it translates well to the Harry Potter world. I can be convinced otherwise but I really dislike the fic Contractual Invalidation which reminds me of this trope, but I understand that it's considered a gold standard fic.

Fics that feature sociopathic main characters. This includes the Art of Self-Fashioning, which I also understand is a well written fic. I worked some years ago as a therapist in a correctional facility and I find most fiction (fan fiction or otherwise) that feature characters like this to be triggering.
