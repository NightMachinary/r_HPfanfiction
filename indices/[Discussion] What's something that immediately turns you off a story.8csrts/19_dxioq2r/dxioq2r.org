Too much canon rehashing

Mary Sues

Muggle references inside Hogwarts

As an H/Hr shipper I really hate 98% of that fanfiction, there is so much wrong with it. Someone else pointed this out by when they make Hermione more important to Harry than Ron is, or when Hermione doesn't seem to care about Ron.

They always make Hermione into some smart pretty girl, when in reality Hermione is a bossy, pushy, she is stubborn, she isn't sympathetic, etc.

They like to make Ginny into a whore, or Ron way too stupid. Ginny is not that, and Ron isn't stupid.

Weasley Bashing.

When they give Hermione a nickname.
