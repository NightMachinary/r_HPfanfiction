I dunno if this is the case for you, but one reason you might feel this way is that your tastes have evolved.

I started noticing awful cliches after awhile. I'm not too embarassed to say that I liked Robst fics at the beginning. It took time to realise I was reading unadulterated drivel. So while I may have tolerated My Own and other such silliness a the beginning, now it comes across as insanely sappy, and I can't stand it.
