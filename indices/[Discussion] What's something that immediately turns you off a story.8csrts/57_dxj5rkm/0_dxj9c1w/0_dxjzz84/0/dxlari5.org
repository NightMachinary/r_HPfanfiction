Maybe in part. I don't know, I can read (and sometimes even enjoy) some pretty bad fanfiction these days if the story line is good enough.\\
I did reread the story when I came back to fanfiction and the nick name still didn't bother me in that particular story. But if muddled memory serves, it wasn't just a randomly picked. There was an actual discussion between characters as to how it came about, the reasoning behind it, and it even played into the story line some. Maybe because with the reasoning behind using the nickname it didn't come across as OOC or trite where as normally it seems like the author just decids that a character is going to suddenly be sweet. Funny enough, I don't mind terms of endearment, though. But if I never run across Draco being called "Dray" and Hermione being called "Mya" again it'll still be 10 minutes to soon.
