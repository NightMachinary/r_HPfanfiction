Grammar is THE main offence of writers all over the internet. This is why my editor and I have a strict 5+ tier editing system where the document gets passed back and forth until it's ready, before a final spelling and grammar check and publishing. Of course, document fatigue is a thing, so sometimes things slip through the cracks, but I try to maintain a high standard.
