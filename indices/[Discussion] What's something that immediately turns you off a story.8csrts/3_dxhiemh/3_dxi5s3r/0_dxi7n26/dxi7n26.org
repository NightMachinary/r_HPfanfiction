A perfect and idealized character where even the flaws are somehow endearing. Indie!Harry fics have this quite often, in which Harry can do absolutely no wrong, becomes super athletic and muscular, wears cool Armani Suits and always ends up on the right side of history or any argument. Bonus points if he has to overcome some inner demons through his strong will and impeccable character ("character flaw").
