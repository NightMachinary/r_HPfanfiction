Wrong on both accounts. A Mary Sue/Gary Stu is an idealized wish-fulfillment character, but while they're /often/ OCs, they also often are OOC versions of canon character, especially Harry and Hermione. And there /is/ a difference between secondary original characters and stories where the OC is the main viewpoint character; the former are frequently alright.
