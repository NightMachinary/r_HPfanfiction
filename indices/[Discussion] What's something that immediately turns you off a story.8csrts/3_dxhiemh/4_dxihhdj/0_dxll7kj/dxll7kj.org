I read a fic one where the author had Dumbledore as being the most insidious diabolical evil mastermind ever and even though Harry and friends were epicly awesome in every way (time travel, harry absorbs Voldemort's memories, fey assistance, reality altering wish magic) Dumbledore is still winning even though he never figured out Harry was his opponent.

After reading this story that has evil Dumbledore done well, I can't read any other fics where he is evil without comparing the 2 and being sadly disappointed.

All that to say, if you are going to defame a character do a good job of it.

Also it is possible to make any character a villain if you do it well.
