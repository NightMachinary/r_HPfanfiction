Bashing provokes a physical sense of disgust from me these days, the singular exception being those out there crack fics. It is just such a lazy way to flesh out an antagonist, utterly predictable and boring and I just wish people would write new ideas, even if it doesn't get the traffic of the usual dull paths people have been retreading for the past 10 years.
