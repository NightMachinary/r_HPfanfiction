OoC without any character or storybuilding to make it believable. Ridiculous plots designed to make OoC behavior or ships work. Like, at least one part has to be believable, if the basis of the character change is a scenario which is itself something that needs a lot of backstory to make sense (and that backstory is absent) that isn't going to cut it for me.
