this is my main turnoff. i can handle a poorly thought out story, but this? fuck no. i read a lot of fanfiction that features Draco, and the first thing i do when opening a new fic is ctrl+F "the blond". used more than once per 50k words? GOODBYE!

i read a really good post about this on tumblr, and it basically said that using descriptors like this is only suitable before the reader and/or the POV character finds out who the descriptor is referring to. as soon as the reference character's name is discovered, use the name. otherwise it just feels artificial and stupid.
