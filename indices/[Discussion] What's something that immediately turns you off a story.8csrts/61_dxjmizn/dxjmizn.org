"I love you."

"I love you, too."

God damn it, give me a fic in which a character says: "I know."

I read way too many stories in which the characters kiss for a first time and then go straight to the I love you's. I think that's why I'm sick of "Oh I love you too."

A scene that ends before a character says it back, or expresses it in some other way (holding hands, hugging/cuddling, I can think of a few) is what I prefer.

It's also a personal thing because I feel awkward when I say "I love you." Even to my own father. To be fair he also has this, it's not that we can't expresses feelings for other people, it's the words that sound awkward. In my father's words: "It's like it's been used in movies and books to the point that it feels like it should stay in movies and books."
