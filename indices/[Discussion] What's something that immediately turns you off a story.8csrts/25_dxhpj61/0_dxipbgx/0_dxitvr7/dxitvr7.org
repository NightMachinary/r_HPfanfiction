It's extremely obnoxious trend I see on Tumblr, basically "imagine if... <cue some completely generic scenario: girl bumps into boy in a coffee shop and spills a frapp on him>"

Then you name all the people in the scenario after some character from HP (except possibly the main/POV character, who is a self/reader insert).

It's shake-and-bake fanfiction. Sadly it's seemingly popular.
