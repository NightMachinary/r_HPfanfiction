The fic has to be well-written technically for me to even bother trying. Aside from that:

1. I HATE cafe/highschool/college/generic modern life/some other popular series (Avengers?) AUs. It just screams "I have no imagination" and/or "I'm trying to write therapy in the form of fic, Harry = me".

2. By the same token I can't stomach "reader", "imagines", self-inserts or mary sues. Basically anywhere the author isn't trying to explore the characters but is just using them as a convenient screen for their own (usually extremely boring) issues.

3. Don't like fics where favourite character (often Harry) has special powers or heritage or is a veela or a half-mermaid or whatever (unless it's REALLY imaginative and well-explored). Or where the kids are on-par with the adults, or adults are treated as stupid.

4. Characters that are unrecognizable -- either bashing them so they're vile when in the books they are clearly decent people, or making them into a saint because they're the author's favourite even if they're a raging dick in the books.

5. Also seconding the hate for Severitis. I very rarely like Snape as the focus in fics because 75% of the time he's unrecognizable and so is everyone else, in order to make him the hero.
