Awful grammar or spelling, snape/hermione unless i like the plot and can just skip over the specific parts, snarry with very few exceptions, terrible formatting, extremely noticeable ooc without a clear reason, harry with a different name, most genderswaps, and just the rather usual for me â€˜I don't like it I can't explain why', and nearly any crossover- I don't think I've ever read more than a chapter of a crossover fic
