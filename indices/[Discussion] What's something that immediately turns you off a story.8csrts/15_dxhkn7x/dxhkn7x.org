Character-in-name-only: I'm searching for fics with that character so that I can get more of that character. Not an OC with the same name.

Ginny-bashing: Sometimes, she's not even in the fic. They just want an H/G breakup and so start off with Harry talking about how all Ginny wanted was his fame. Back button.

Hermione as Harry's closest friend: Like with Harmony fiction, a Harry who puts Hermione above all is usually not a Harry I like. This is a warning sign.

Extreme angst/abuse: No subtlety. Feels like they're trying to manipulate me into giving a damn.

...OP!Harry, kids that act like they're 30, adults being berated by 11/12/13 year old kids, genius Hermione, overblown marauders...
