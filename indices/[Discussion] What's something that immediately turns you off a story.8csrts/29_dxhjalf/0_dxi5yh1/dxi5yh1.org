  Magical cores

I don't even get why they use this trope. You'd think they would use it as a good way to limit the characters' abilities but it doesn't even matter that the main character has a magical core because they're overpowered as shit and only exhaust their core or whatever the fuck at the end of the story to create some semblance of tension only to completely ruin the whole thing by implementing some bullshit that makes the main character suddenly build up a metric fuckton of magical energy in their core(completely ignoring the fact that maybe storing so much energy in one place is probably not safe for anyone) and EXPLODE, CAUSING A SHOCKWAVE OF PURE MAGICAL ENERGY THAT INCINERATED EVERYTHING AROUND THEM. Honestly, if you're going to pull that shit, at least make it important for the characters.
