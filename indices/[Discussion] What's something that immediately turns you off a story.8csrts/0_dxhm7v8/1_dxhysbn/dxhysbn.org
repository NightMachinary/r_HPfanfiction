There was this one really cool story (Barefoot?) about how Harry had this power where he kind of absorbs the memories/history of any object he touches. It was very interesting, but I kind of lost interest once Harry became OP emo Harry, and then things started getting sexual. I didn't read that far, but I think he winds up getting a Harem and Hedwig turns into a human girl... and also becomes a part of the harem, I think. It was one of the most dramatic declines of my interest in a story I have ever experienced.

If you just read until it gets weird, though, it's still a pretty good story.
