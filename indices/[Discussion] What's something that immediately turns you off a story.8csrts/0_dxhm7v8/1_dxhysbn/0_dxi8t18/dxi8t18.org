That's what's so strange about it, though, because I actually /didn't/ have that reaction to Barefoot.

It's hard to think of an example because the fics I don't read are much less memorable than the ones I do, but I went through the recently-updated fics and found linkffn(11894165), which I'll use just because it's the highest-rated example of what I'm talking about. It got weird for me when Hermione and Draco wound up accidentally soul-bonded (if by another name), and I couldn't keep reading. And I know that sounds hypocritical because I just wrote an accidental soul bond (by another name) myself in /Lady Archmiedes/, but I just couldn't take it in this one.

To be fair, I was afraid the incident in /Lady Archimedes/ would be poorly received for precisely that reason, but that turned out not to be the case. I like to think that I set it up better, whereas in /The Eagle's Nest/, it came completely out of left field. Plus, while I sometimes read Dramione, I have a much lower tolerance for it than other pairings, which probably contributed.

I could apply this to other tropes, too. I think it's not the particular trope, but subtle differences in how it's used that make it work in one fic while another crashes and burns.
