I think your soul bonding in the The Arithmancer is the most unique way i have seen the trope implemented. Not only that, but having Hermione have a nervous breakdown for what she accidentally did, wow. Can't wait to read the rest, especially if that means you'll start updating the Accidental Animagus again.
