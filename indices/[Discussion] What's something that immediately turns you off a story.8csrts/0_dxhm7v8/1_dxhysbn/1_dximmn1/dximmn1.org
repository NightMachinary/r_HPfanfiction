I still follow /Barefoot/, and... I see why you'd think that way, but /Barefoot/ kinda skirts the line on both accounts. He never gets a true harem, though at one point he considers polyamory with the Human!Hedwig and Tonks. And things get "sexualish", but there never is any full-blown smut. Point is, yes, it got weird, but it didn't take over the story (the current arc is a very neat Azkaban one) and didn't get /too/ off-the-mark.
