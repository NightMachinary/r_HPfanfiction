Hmm, let's see. The top five that come to mind for me are:

1. Poor spelling, grammar, or formatting.

2. Excessive canon rehashing. I can actually tolerate quite a bit of rehashing, but if the story goes out of its way to keep things the same that would logically change. The worst offender is having the opportunity to dramatically change the DoM fight, but still having Sirius die in the exact same way.

3. Wrong Boy-Who-Lived. I don't know what it is about this trope, but every time I see it in the summary, it sounds like the most boring story imaginable to me for no reason--and that's before you get to the extreme-OOC James and Lily.

4. Infantilizing Harry. This is most common in Severitis fics. I know the more common complaint is that young characters sound too mature, but Harry always seems to wind up sounding half his age in these stories.

5. If I actually get past the first chapter, I've found that the most common thing that makes me click away is, "It got weird." I can't really explain what constitutes "weird" or give an example. It's that something happens, or there's a plot twist that feels "wrong" to me, and I'm out.
