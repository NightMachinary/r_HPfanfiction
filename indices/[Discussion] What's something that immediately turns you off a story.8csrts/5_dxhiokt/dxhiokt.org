For me it's way too much detail (usually on details on the location) in the very beginning of the story. I usually just scroll through till there is dialogue or something of interest. I like to imagine my own settings when reading. When someone writes a paragraph about the weather when you can just say "it was raining outside" I usually am turned off. That's just me though.
