Bad formatting, terrible grammar, hopeless spelling, and inconsistent characterization. I don't really mind if characters are OOC from canon, but I do need them to be consistent within the fic itself. If a story has really good characterizations with believable (within the fic) motivations, I'll read about characters and ships that I don't really like that much.
