JKR characterizes Lupin as a caring, sensible person whose lycanthropy has forced him to develop a great sense of restraint and caution, but which doesn't lead him to act particularly distant, save for his omission of his role in Harry's parents' lives at the beginning of Harry's 3rd year, which did not prevent him from being a good professor to Harry. This is the case when he is in the picture, and aside from his behavior as regards Tonks and, later, his unborn child, never changes.

When he's not in the picture, i.e. when JKR forgets that he exists because he's not Sirius, he becomes a hidden, faraway figure that doesn't care enough about Harry to so much as check up on him during the Triwizard Tournament. Before Harry's 3rd year, he doesn't even merit a mention, in contrast to Sirius, who gets a mention IIRC in the very first chapter of the Philosopher's Stone. Moony might as well have not been invented yet, and probably hadn't been.

His only major onscreen sin was to consider running from the responsibility of raising a child, and despite Harry's severe negative reaction, he had a damn good reason to be wary. He's not some deadbeat that wants to remain a bachelor without the albatross of a baby to look after, he's a man that, monthly, becomes a savage, uncontrollable beast with superhuman strength and agility. Those concerns may be easily addressed 99% of the time with simple precautions, but this is a man who has lived since childhood with a crippling terror that he would someday hurt someone, and who has once before, through a lapse in vigilance of entirely his own making, nearly done so.
