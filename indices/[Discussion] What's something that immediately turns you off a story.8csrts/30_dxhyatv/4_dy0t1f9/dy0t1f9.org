  Lupin, Snape or Malfoy in a prominent role: The first ran from his pregnant wife and never gave a fuck about Harry, Snape was a thoroughly shitty human being and Malfoy was a spoiled brat. Not even a spoiled brat who's a credible threat like Joffrey "Baratheon", just a whiny guy who is little more than comic relief.

These are all true in the canon. Lupin is an inconsistent character who JKR doesn't put much thought into. Snape, for all his complications, is a vile person that relentlessly bullies small children, and is a god-awful teacher. Malfoy is a boring, imbecilic turd without the tiniest redeeming factor, and remains so until the epilogue, where he is present for no other reason that I can see, other than to show that the trio (other than Ron, who is still, unaccountably, a git) have moved on from their schoolchild rivalries.

I don't see that this means that fanfics have to preserve these characterizations. Lupin has potential as a good-person-with-a-furry-problem if you don't make him make the same ill-conceived decisions as in canon, and/or give him credible excuses when he does (having Lupin be out of contact with Harry prior to 3rd year in particular is forgivable if he's manipulated by Dumbledore). Snape can't believably do a 180 and become a wonderful person, but if you change his choices, especially during Harry's 1st year, you can make good-ish!Snape work. Malfoy isn't much of a character to begin with, and he's so shaped by his choices and interactions during his 7 years at Hogwarts that you can do basically anything to him and find some way to justify the personality shift.
