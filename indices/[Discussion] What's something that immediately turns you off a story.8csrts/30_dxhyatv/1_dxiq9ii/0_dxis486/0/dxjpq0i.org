  Snape is an annoyance at best.
#+end_quote

he's also a genius, their resident dark wizard, a direct parallel with harry and tom, and an ex-DE who regrets his past actions and is actively working against them. he's the only character we have with a significant and ongoing redemption arc. he also has personal connections to so many different environments- the hogwarts staff, the malfoys, dumbledore, the DEs, lily and petunia, etc. you can do so many things with his character it's ridiculous
