And for me he stopped being anything but scum when he voluntarily joined the Death Eaters out of conviction. Getting caught with a bag of Weed or stealing a pack of cigarettes can be ignored as childhood mistakes, but joining the magical Waffen SS is far beyond that.

And let's take a look at his redemption, shall we. He was an atrocious teacher who fucked over an entire generation by depriving them of Aurors, Healers and whatever else profession needs a NEWT in potions. His teaching methods were so bad that he became Neville's boggart. Not Bellatrix Lestrange, who turned his parents into vegetables, but his teacher. He also nearly got several people mauled by a werewolf because he didn't take the Wolfsbane, which he just brought to his office, to Lupin. His occlumancy lessons were nothing but torture without instruction and his one redeeming deed was a mail delivery. That does not lool very redeeming to me. More like a lie he told himself to feel better about all the shitty things he did.
