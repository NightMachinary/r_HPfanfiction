The way I've seen (and done) a good "funny Draco" characterization is by writing him as "a kitten trying to be an evil overlord". A small, skinny eleven-year-old who's not particularly intelligent or powerful, but strolls around /acting/ like he's a Dark Lord in his own right, being a pompous evil mastermind about a way to put up a tripwire in front of the Gryffindor Corridor and demanding his minions bow to his genius when he decides it'll be fun to call Hermione a mudblood.
