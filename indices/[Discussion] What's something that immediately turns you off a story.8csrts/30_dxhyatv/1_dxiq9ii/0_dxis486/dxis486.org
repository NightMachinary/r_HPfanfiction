Because I find neither interesting. Malfoy's best moment was getting face punched by Hermione. I mean, sure, you can crack a few jokes of him being more than friends with Crabbe and Goyle or throw some shade at Darry, but that stops being funny at a certain point. He is not funny enough to be the comic relief and not dangerous enough to be a credible threat. He is a little shit like Joffrey "Baratheon", but he doesn't have the same amount of nearly absolute power behind him. Draco is pretty much the boring tutorial boss where you show that you understand the controls of the game.

Snape is an annoyance at best. He is an arse, an awful teacher and a horrible human being, but what's the worst that he'll do, give you detention? Unless you write him as an outright Death Eater who turns his coat once more, he is not really dangerous. He is not bad enough to warrant a stunner from under the invisibility cloak followed up with a late night visit to Aragog like Umbridge. Some people see him as conflicted, tragic character. He's pretty much the guy who gets shot down by a Jewish girl after a racial slur and then signs up for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsatzgruppen][Einsatzgruppen]] in revenge.

And Lupin is a walking pity party. Sure, being a werewolf isn't easy, but it's still far better than growing up in a cupboard after watching your parents getting murdered.

Tl;dr: I find these characters boring and they fit neither as comic relief nor credible villain (With the exception of "Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood!")
