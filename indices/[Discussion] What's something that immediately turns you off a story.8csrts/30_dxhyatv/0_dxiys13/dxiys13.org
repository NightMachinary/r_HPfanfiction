Ugh. Any fic that places Lupin in a fatherly role with Harry drives me crazy.

- He disappeared from Harry's life until he was 13 and returned because of Sirius.
- He threw the death of James/Lily in Harry's face to shame him for his lack of safety while hiding the fact that Sirius was an animagus and knew multiple secret entrances into the school.
- He disappeared again after PoA, not even showing interest when Harry was entered into an extremely dangerous tournament. There's something wrong with a guy on the run being able to keep in touch when Lupin can't bother.
- He doesn't show special interest after Sirius' death either. There's a line in HBP about Harry had hoped Lupin would write to him but he never did.
- He used Harry's parents again to try to justify leaving his own child and lashed out when Harry rightfully called him out for being a coward.

Lupin was not a father figure to Harry. He was seemingly uninterested in Harry the majority of the time. It bothers me seeing him in this role like he's at all fit for it. I especially hate when it's a story where Sirius is really the guardian but Remus is presented as the better and more mature person who hangs around so Sirius doesn't screw things up. Really?!!! Because the terminally absent guy is more fit to raise a kid than the one who ate rats just to be close to Harry during a difficult time?
