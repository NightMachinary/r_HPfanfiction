  First of all there is probably only so many ways to off Dark Lord without ridiculous risk to oneself.

Well, a bullet should do the trick. On a more serious note however, it is ridiculous how many authors write situations where Voldemort is basically tied up and bend over, but Harry is like "Nah, we've got to destroy the Horcruxes first". And defying his rule by killing him would help the rebel cause. Any measure taken by the Ministry or the Death Eaters would alienate many of those not directly involved in the war.
