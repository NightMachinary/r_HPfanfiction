I'm with you on everything expect for this:

#+begin_quote
  Horcrux hunts where they think that Horcruxes make Voldemort invulnerable. His body dies just as easily as without them and it would be a lot easier to deal with Horcruxes without the magical Gestapo running around.
#+end_quote

I don't think destroying his body would do them any good. First of all there is probably only so many ways to off Dark Lord without ridiculous risk to oneself.\\
Secondly, without also killing bunch of Death Eaters, there is nothing stopping Voldemort followers from resurrecting him ASAP.\\
And retaliation\escalation for daring to defy Voldemort rule to such an extent would most likely be pretty horrible.
