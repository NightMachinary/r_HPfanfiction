Lupin, Snape or Malfoy in a prominent role: The first ran from his pregnant wife and never gave a fuck about Harry, Snape was a thoroughly shitty human being and Malfoy was a spoiled brat. Not even a spoiled brat who's a credible threat like Joffrey "Baratheon", just a whiny guy who is little more than comic relief.

The happy Weasley family. I have a personal experience with bad family, and let me tell you, adults who say that they will help you, are concerned and all that crap, and yet do nothing are pretty much the worst that can happen to you. And Molly does just that to Harry. In CoS she says that she has her suspicions about the Dursleys, and yet never calls the cops/DMLE. It is definitely a personal thing, but for this reason I can't stand any story where Molly is Harry's honorary mother. Sending food is not a proper response to child abuse.

Postwar stories where the pureblood supremacists haven't been purged from the Ministry. You won the war, you make the rules. Hermione should know that the only way to defeat fascism is through total defeat and a massively restructured government. And Hermione would tell Harry, who just defeated Voldemort in a 1vs1.

A close to canon Battle of Hogwarts. A frontal assault against a fortified hilltop position with several hundred yards of open ground all around should not work. In fact it would be like shooting fish in a barrel for the defenders.

Horcrux hunts where they think that Horcruxes make Voldemort invulnerable. His body dies just as easily as without them and it would be a lot easier to deal with Horcruxes without the magical Gestapo running around.
