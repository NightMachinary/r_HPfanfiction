Don't mind me I'm just going to rant about some shit.

I hate the fusions, like Harry Potter characters in the little Mermaid retelling, please be more imaginative than watching Beauty and the Beast and thinking "you know what would make this better? making all these characters just play out Beauty and the Beast".

Severitis - I didn't even know this was the name for it, or that it had a name, but I agree, Snape was a wanker, he lived a wanker, he died a wanker and if anyone writes other wise I will be hitting the back space as fast as I can.

Bashing of characters that don't deserve it - I can see why some people don't like Dumbledore (even though they go way over the top with it) but the Weasleys did nothing bad to Harry and only ever treated him as one of their own.

Hogwarts AUs - I like crossovers so when I see something I like being tagged as a Harry Potter crossover I get exited only to see that it's not a crossover its a freaking Hogwarts AU.

Modern AUs/Human AUs/Muggle AUs - I'm reading fanfiction because I want to read about the characters and the worlds and settings that they're in. To me the these AUs plus ones like High School AUs, Cafe AUs and such are basically just the Author saying "here's the characters you love but I made them boring".

Butchering the characters names - no one is impressed by any one calling Voldemort "moldyshorts". Also Harry has a great name, please use it and stop calling him "Hadrian" when you want to make him fancy.

OOC - I don't mind a character being OOC if they have a reason to be that way, but most of the time they seem to just be OOC so they can make them cool and edgy.

OC - I've just had too many bad experiences with them being Mary Sue/Gary Stus.

Spelling, Grammar, wall of text and Lapslocks - That speaks for it's self.

Main character being OP - I think making the character OP just usually makes them boring, I want to see characters struggling and learning.

I'm pretty sure I have a lot more.... ¯_(ツ)_/¯
