  but the Weasleys did nothing bad to Harry and only ever treated him as one of their own.

Implying that's a good thing. Harry is probably better off in a cupboard than becoming best buddies with Diarymort, being a pompous git at the ministry or *shudder* like Ron. Not to mention the twins who are just incredible amounts of wasted potential because they direct all their energies towards rebelling against their stifling mother.

The good parts of their family like Bill are probably elated to live as isolated as possible from the rest. "Hey everyone, this is my fiance Fleur whom I love very much!" "Flem!!!" "Yeah, go away you Veela tart!". Yeah no, being a Weasley is completely awesome. Maybe Harry can get some lessons from Molly on how to insult his godfather in his own house too. Maybe he'd even learn to resent his own parents along the way, wouldn't that be swell?!
