Just for the sake of clarity: I don't actually believe that it's better for Harry to live with the Dursleys than the Weasleys. Hyperbole doesn't come across properly.

I'm not blaming Ginny, I'm blaming her parents. Ron, Ginny and Percy are very troubled children. If Harry had been a Weasley child he may have fallen for the "There's only power" line by Voldemort, because he would have been desperate to prove his worth and get some kind of recognition.

I'm not comparing the Weasleys to abusive parents. I just have to object to the idea that they are oh so wonderful. I'd have to be a lot harsher with Ron if that were the case, but I cut him some slack because he's grown up with the Weasleys and he's not the fastest broom in the shed.
