The Weasleys have flaws, no one is denying that, Humans have flaws after all. Ginny made a mistake when she was 11 years old, are you really going to judge a child on a mistake for the rest of they're life? Percy surrounded himself with bad people and made some mistakes, but in the end he realised what he was doing and pulled his head out of his ass. Ron has problems with anger and jealousy and sometimes friends fight and don't want to talk to each other for a bit but in the end he always comes back because he's loyal and he loves his friends.

As someone who's had an abusive and oppressive parent I can tell you that calling Molly oppressive is an insult to any one that has actually had an oppressive parent.

Some times people just don't like their sibling's or child's new partner, especially when they come from very different backgrounds and the engagement seemed to just come out of nowhere.
