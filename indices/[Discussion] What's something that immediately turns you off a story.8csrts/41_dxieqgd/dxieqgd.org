Irksome but not dealbreakers:

- POV switching;
- Inability to correctly use imply/infer (ESL excepted);
- Inability to understand that banishing and vanishing mean different things and have different incantations;
- Use of the phrase, "illegal animagus". It's not illegal, ever, to be an animagus. It's illegal not to register.
