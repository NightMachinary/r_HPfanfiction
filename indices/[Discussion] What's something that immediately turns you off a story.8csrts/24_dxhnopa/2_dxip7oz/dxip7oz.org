1: I don't see what's so "gross" about the idea of Snape and Lily having done the thing, unless you find the idea that a good person might fall for a rather unattractive one repulsive. Is it a very weird trope, and kind of OOC for Snape to behave like that to Harry for any reason? Yes. But I wouldn't describe it as gross.

2: For the fun of original curbstomping? There's a hundred boring Dark!Harry sludges for one of these, but things like linkffn(Core Threads) and linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) have a sort of exhilarating effect to read once in a while. The trick is for the story to be self-aware about its lack of suspense and how any angst would be silly.
