Post-war fics like you described aren't what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the ones where Harry gets to Hogwarts and instantly becomes the magical world's protege and already more powerful than every adult by the end of his first year at Hogwarts. By the time he graduates he basically more powerful than Merlin and is capable of conquering the world. If you're into that, great.
