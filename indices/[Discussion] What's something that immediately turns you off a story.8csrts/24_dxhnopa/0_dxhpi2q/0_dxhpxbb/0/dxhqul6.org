That's true of most things. The hero always wins.

You don't have to have a DBZ-style "the Big Bad is going to destroy the planet!!1!" conflict to have a conflict.

What about a post-war fic where a now-insanely-powerful Harry has to deal with the aftermath of the war---how relationships have changed, dealing with loss, finding a routine that doesn't prod at his nerves or PTSD?

How about a fic where the /people/ are the conflict rather than some murderer or combat? What if post-war, things just didn't change? Muggleborn are still treated poorly and roughly shoved into the magical world; werewolves are still mistreated, and many murderers are still not in Azkaban. Being able to vanish the entirety of Hogwarts with a flick of your wrist wouldn't solve any of that.
