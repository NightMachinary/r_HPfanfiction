1. Definitely Severitis, it's just gross. Like I actually thought it was a disease before I figured out it just meant Snape was Harry's Dad...and I would actually prefer it being a disease than it meaning Snape boned Lily.

2. Bashing of any character just gets old really fast. Usually the fics with bashing aren't very well written anyways.

3. Slash because that's not my thing.

4. GOD!Harry is pointless too. What's the point of reading 200k words when I know he's gonna win anyway?
