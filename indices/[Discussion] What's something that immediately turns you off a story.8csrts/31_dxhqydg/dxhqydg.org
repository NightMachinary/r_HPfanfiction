Bad grammar is the worst. It's one thing to not see minor issues in your own story (you're too in it, you don't have a beta, you rewrote something and forgot to amend something else) but having complete disregard for how basic sentence structure works is too far and makes it unreadable.

I hate the Luna stereotype, where she is nonsensical. I equally hate when she is all-knowing.

Extreme bashing is hard to read, even if it is Dumbledore, but especially when it's Ron or Ginny or whomever, it just makes me skip and if I skip parts too often in a story I'm out and I'll go look for another.

Time travel generally bugs me unless it's canon (POA) or makes sense in the grand scheme of things, and that's really the key to everything. A lot can be forgiven if it makes sense in the story and the writing is well done. The better the writing the more likely the tropes will feel less trope-y.

And last but not least, rambling author notes which possibly include replies to every single comment on the last chapter and your personal banter. Give me a note about the story or don't say anything! I did not do a search for a specific word count to find every other chapter (!) to be a letter to your friends. Sorry, I really don't care.
