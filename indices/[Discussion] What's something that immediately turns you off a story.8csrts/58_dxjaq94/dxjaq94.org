1) I can actually put up with some crappy spelling and grammar (probably because I have issues with it myself). But you really can't skip the full stops. Or capitalization. The author really needs to be able to handle those.\\
2) Emo. Don't. Just don't. 3) Nicknames. I don't mind the occasional usage, especially between paired couples, but I should not require a key to keep track of people because the author thinks it would be cooler if "Dray" and "Miah" made friends. 4) Extreme angst. Cramming 10 pounds of angst into a 3 pound bag doesn't make the story better. Especially when doing a star-crossed lovers bit. Stop it.\\
5) Writing the characters to all sound like squabbling 12 year olds in the girls locker room. I'm good with OOC. I even appreciate OOC. But Snape and McGonagall will NEVER use the vernacular of an over excited tween.\\
6) Pick a narrative and stick with it. Or at least break it up somehow. I ran across a story with a really interesting plot line - that would randomly switch from 3rd person narrative to 1st in the middle of a paragraph. And then every chapter or two would toss in a little 2nd person narrative. It was like mental whiplash trying to follow it.
