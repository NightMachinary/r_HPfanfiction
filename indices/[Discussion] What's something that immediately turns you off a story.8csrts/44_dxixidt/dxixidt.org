1) poor spelling, grammar, formatting. If I can't read it, I can't enjoy it.

2) changing canon(too much). If the premise of the story is a "what if this one thing was different", that I can live with. What I won't read is stories that go "what if this never happened? Genderswap, alternate ships, time travel, muggleborn high school AU". Just stop...

I do prefer complete canon compliance (excluding cursed child) but if it's written well I can still enjoy it.

3) Rushing the plot. If the story starts with someone waking up on September the first, and 3 paragraphs later they're in their new bed in their new house at hogwarts, talking to their new friends, there's a problem.

4) 'Mione.

Go to jail. Go directly to jail. Do not pass GO. Do not collect $200

5) Lack of consistency/changing canon information (not the story, but background information). When an author doesn't take the time to check established lore/facts/knowledge /etc. This one can be the one that breaks a story for me, or it could just be a minor gripe I have with it.

For example, when I read a next-gen story where Victoire is only a year younger than Teddy instead of two. To be fair, we don't know Victoire's exact birth year, but it's a simple matter of counting backwards and examining the context of the epilogue to realize that she has to be at least two years younger. You could go further to say that two years is likely the real number, since a three year age difference is a bit much at that age.

But I digress, sometimes it's a minor issue, sometimes it's the author changing the way magic works.

6) Overly simplified or changer character personalities.

As an example, this is the main problem I had with Cursed Child, and why I ignore it when considering canon compliance. Harry grew up without a real family, so the notion that we would ever say what he did to his own son is unthinkable. Yes, people change as they grow up, but his unconditional love for his friends and new family would never leave him.
