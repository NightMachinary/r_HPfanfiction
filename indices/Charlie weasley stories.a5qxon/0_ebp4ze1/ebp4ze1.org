Do you like a Charlie Weasley/Hermione Granger pairing? If so, here's my list:\\

In my opinion, The Sparrow Suite is the best written and was last updated in March of this year. Nocturnal is also really good and imaginative and is the longest Charlie Weasley/Hermione Granger romance story I've come across (not that that means anything). Games are Afoot is also good but feels extremely rushed at the end (in the last chapter (there's only one line of dialogue and it's not said by either Charlie or Hermione, and the chapter itself is several paragraphs). The rest of the story is really good though. 2 Weeks in Romania and Letters are good for what they are but not well-written. However, they're fun to read if you have nothing to do on a lazy Sunday afternoon.

Last Christmas, Let it Burn, Another Bloody Birthday, and The Freedom Land of the Seventies are all filled with a lot of smut. All are well-written (sorry for my shameless advertising of my own story). A Pleasurable Kind of Torture is a one-shot but is very well done; it's the second-best written story I've included behind The Sparrow Suite. Finally, And Gryffindor Roars was my first story I'd written on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] and don't think it's put together all that well. But if you want to check it out, feel free.

Also, A Pleasurable Kind of Torture, The Freedom Land of the Seventies , and Last Christmas are all one-shots. Letters is unfinished (most likely abandoned). The Sparrow Suite and Let it Burn are both still in-progress. And the rest are all completed (though again, I use that loosely with Games are Afoot).
