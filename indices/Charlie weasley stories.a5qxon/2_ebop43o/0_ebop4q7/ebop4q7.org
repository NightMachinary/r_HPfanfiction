  In the days following the Department of Mysteries there is no respite for Harry, Ginny learns she is not the plain outsider she thinks she is. Grief and fear lead to late night connections for Ron and Hermione. Sixth year pre HBP AU.This is the story I wrote and posted way back in 2005. I'm posting it here by request since the other sites it was posted on are down. It is incomplete, but I do have a 50th chapter that has been sitting on a flash drive for a decade. My plan is to tweak it so that there is some closure and have the whole story transferred here by Labor Day.
