Linkffn(Marry You by Dorothea Greengrass)

She has another fic that fits that I can't quite remember the name of- 'From London to Southampton and Beyond' or something similar? The one with the cruise ship.

I've read a lot of these honestly(Mostly HP/DG and HP/OC which is arguably very similar), and I'm stuck on mobile presently. I can find more in a couple weeks when I'm back at my PC. I'll try to remember.
