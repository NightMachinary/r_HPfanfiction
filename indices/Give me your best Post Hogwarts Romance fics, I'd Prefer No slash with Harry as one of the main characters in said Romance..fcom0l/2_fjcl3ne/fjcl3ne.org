linkffn(What We Lost by JacobApples) this is my absolute favorite romance fic ever. Harry and Andromeda. Andy is catatonic while taking care of Teddy due to all her family dying. Harry comes by and takes it upon himself to help raise Teddy.

linkffn(The Favour by mrs.milfoy) Harry agrees to take Narcissa on a date to the theater so Draco can go bang his lady friend in peace. A romance blooms between Potter and Narcissa.

Epilogue of linkffn(The Pureblood Princess by TheE dless7) i absolutely adore it as a one-shot. The story it's attached to not so much.

linkffn(A Different Life by phoenixgirl26) Potter/Tonks. Tonks lives due to dreamless sleep potion. Potter puts life on hold to help care for her and Teddy.

linkffn(Beltane Child by White Angel of Auralon) Harry and Daphne bang in costume during a festival. Daphne becomes pregnant and goes on search for the father after the war. (Can't remember if this is post hogwarts but it's definitely post the war.)
