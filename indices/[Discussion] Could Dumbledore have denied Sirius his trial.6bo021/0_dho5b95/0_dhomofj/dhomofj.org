The fact that Dumbledore gave evidence implies that there was some kind of hearing at which Sirius' guilt was decided. Sirius states that there was no trial, but of course he wouldn't know the difference between no trial and being tried in absentia.

Trials in absentia are in fact legal within the English legal system, albeit unusual. They are allowed for reason of illness of the defendant, or misbehavior, or abscondment. Magical law may have its own provisions, but it's possible that Sirius' absence was justified on the basis of illness: remember that he was widely considered insane, and as such might have been deemed to lack mental capacity.

Indeed, from what we saw in GoF, all Death Eater trials were conducted with the defendant absent. Karkaroff, Bellatrix, Crouch Jr, Rabastan and Rodolphus were not present for the presentation of evidence or argument over law. They were only brought into attendance to hear their sentence. So trial in absentia may be standard in the wizarding world.

In any case, it's important to recall that it was Barty Crouch Sr who led the trials of Death Eaters by the Council of Magical Law, not Dumbledore, who was a regular member of the court.
