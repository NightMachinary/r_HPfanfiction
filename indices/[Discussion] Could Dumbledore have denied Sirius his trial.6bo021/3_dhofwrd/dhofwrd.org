- Part of the fault of Sirius imprisonment lie with the Potters. They should made some contingency plans if something like that happens. Although I don't exactly remember if they were aware of the prophecy or not. What they expected? That Voldemort would die of an old age and they will live happily ever after?
- Nevertheless, Dumbledore knew that Sirius and James were best friends and like brothers to each other. He should at least investigate why would Sirius betray him.
- It is possible he was Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot even back in '80s. And even if he wasn't, he must knew that there was no trial.
- To the whole "custody of Harry Potter" thing - With the exception of Dumbledore, McGonagall and Hagrid no one even knew where Harry Potter lived for a ten years until he came to Hogwarts. It says something about Dumbledore intentions. He even admitted it to Harry in the fifth book when he told him the prophecy.

In my opinion Dumbledore isn't evil or bad or something like that. He did exactly what he had to do in order to defeat Voldemort. In great scheme of things it was masterfully done.
