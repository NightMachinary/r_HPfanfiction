I'm not wondering about whether it might be the case in canon (I know Crouch made the decision there); I'm wondering whether it makes sense /in the story/. I didn't mention it in details, but there's a pretty solid non-Crouch-related explanation for why Dumbledore had the authority to do that in /Vaults of Stone/.
