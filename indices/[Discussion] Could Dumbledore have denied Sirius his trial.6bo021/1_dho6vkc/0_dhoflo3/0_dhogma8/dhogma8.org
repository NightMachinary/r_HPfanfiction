I cannot say whether it makes sense in the story for I have not read it, but you have this: it can only make sense if the story actually gives a reason for Bones and Bagnold, rather than Crouch, having the power to decide about Sirius's fate. As the story supposedly (based on the summary) diverges after the events of Halloween of 1981, I am kind of doubting that this is the case, but if it actually is a thing then that is that.

And that applies to every story that is not fully AU with the whole world rebuilt, really; in those, sure, the author can do whatever they want with their world, but if the world of any given story is based on the canon one then there needs to be a reason for such a ... discrepancy, as this.
