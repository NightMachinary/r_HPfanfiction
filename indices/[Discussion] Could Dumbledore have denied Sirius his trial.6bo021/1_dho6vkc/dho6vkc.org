It's ... unlikely, to say the least. Possible, but very damn unlikely.

What some people do not get is that, no matter Madam Rowling's many mishaps with consistency when writing certain things, there actually is a basis in the British law for what Barty Crouch did, and while there are still questions one would likely ask before accepting that possibility, these are not without answers that would not point to Dumbledore.

And, since we know it was Barty Crouch who made the decision, the version put in that story (assuming the idea you propose comes from it) is simply impossible as Amelia Bones would have no input on where Sirius would go, and neither would Bagnold; heck, we don't even know if Bagnold was on good enough terms with Dumbledore for him to have any hold over her. So for it to happen in any way Albus would have to convince Crouch to do it, in a situation in which Crouch felt like letting Sirius go---which is unlikely at best.

Assuming you do not go for “J.K.Rowling did not know shit” as the answer to this particular conundrum, one would have to take into account the information we do have: that the ministry was operating under wartime laws in 1981, that the law giving law officers the ability to pronounce someone the evidence of whose guilt is overwhelming and obvious guilty without a trial during wartime is most likely there (it was a part of British laws for a fairly long time), and that the actual trials of the Death Eaters were mostly a publicity stunt for Crouch---what with his son being one of them---and there wasn't much of a point in having a trial for an “obviously guilty” gibbering wreck of a person (who could also have garnered sympathy from people because of his lamenting which would have put Crouch in a bad light). While Albus could have had a hand in it by providing evidence, for what the evidence is worth because being a secret keeper of a secret not kept well is not a crime but merely a red flag for the person's character, I feel that his actions there didn't really serve to change anything for Crouch would have done the same even without him.
