It is impossible to look at Dumbledore's actions in canon and conclude that he's a good person. The manipulative Dumbledore trope is merely a conclusion when the supposed greatest wizard of the century does nothing while a bunch of kids have to save the day.

Unless you want to argue that Dumbledore simply lost his mind in the seventies there is no logical explanation for his faults. Sure, everyone makes mistakes but he missed

Voldemort possessing his teacher for a year,

Missed a giant snake roaming his castle,

was instrumental to a severe miscarriage of justice,

Did the same thing again,

missed a Death Eater impersonating his friend,

did nothing to stop Harry's participation in a bloodsport,

let his students be tortured,

withheld strategic information that got people killed and injured,

used completely ineffective tactics in the war he was waging which lead to even more deaths,

admitted to accessory of child abuse and torture while not seeing anything wrong with this,

let at least one terrorist (Draco Malfoy) stay in his castle and try several attacks that ended in severe injuries close to death,

Did nothing to gain vital information from Slughorn (Veritaserum, Felix Felicitis, conventional interrogation methods)

Withheld strategic information again,

Relied on child soldiers

Tell me, how can such a person be anything but either senile or a manipulative bastard?
