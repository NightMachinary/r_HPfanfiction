And you forgot the very first example in canon. He left a one year old child on a doorstep for his relatives and new guardians to stumble upon in the morning. Even if you assume that he took precautions to ensure that baby Harry did not freeze to death, wasn't eaten or carried off by some animal, or didn't just wander off himself (and that's being very charitable since it isn't mentioned at all) that's grossly irresponsible behaviour, especially from a government official. Sticking purely to canon, I think he's mostly a bit senile, but he had to be written that way because Harry et al could not have had their adventure if all the adults behaved responsibly and rationally.
