I disagree. My son was born when I was 20 years old and, while my circumstances weren't ideal, I was (and am) able to take care of him. Obviously not every case is the same, but there's no reason to believe that someone who is "21 years old, single, has no experience" is incapable of caring for a child. Unexpected pregnancies happen to millions of people and, should Sirius have been willing, wasn't in prison, and the Potters' wills had actually named him to be Harry's guardian, there's no reason to suggest it could have been "very easily disputed".
