I'm not sure I buy the whole "Sirius would raise Harry" thing. Sure, in story, we see Dumbledore just dropping Harry off with the Dursleys. We don't know what kind of procedure was done in doing that, and it's easy to assume nothing. But, at least the Dursleys were qualified (and I use that term very losely.) Sirius is a single male, 21 years old, no experience with kids or a family or any idea how to raise one, no job that we know of, with a murky background. Handing an infant to this guy just because someone's will may or may not suggest it seems like a crazy thing to do, and I could see it being very easily disputed.
