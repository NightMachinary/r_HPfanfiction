It's crazy thinking how long it's actually been since the books come out...I feel old just thinking about it, I still remember some of the fics people wrote before DH was even released and it's always interesting seeing how much tropes and cliches have changes (and how some have stayed the same) over the years.

I don't think I necessarily have a problem with styles of writing changing as newer fans begin writing more and more fics although I may not particularly like the style like you said we will probably need to get use to it.

And yeah by no means was canon harry great...honestly because I've read a lot of (in my opinion) good stories with harry being somewhat canon compliant I feel spoiled now. As fun as the books are when you have an author create such a huge and fun adventure the original feels...boring? Maybe it's because I've read/watched the original so much though lmao.

Maybe because of that I'm more lenient with non canon harry but I do wish we had more...at least realistic harry, a harry who would act like a human and not some...idk tumblr teen going through his green day and MCR phase. It's always painful dealing with either super dumb harry who can't grasp anything or super emo harry and oh it just gets so much worse when Sirius is introduced into the story. It's like that's the switch for harry to start writing "deep" and sad poems on a my space page with the way people write him sometimes.
