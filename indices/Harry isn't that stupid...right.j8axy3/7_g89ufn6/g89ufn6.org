I mean, canon Harry doesn't help lol But I understand what you mean, I think the lack of good authors is really suffering and ridiculous, too lazy there to develop a good story. I believe that those fics where Harry is a complete idiot usually want to highlight another character and make it save the day, so idk maybe that's the reason. As I said in another topic the other day, the latest fans are more rational kids than we were at their age, so they tend to write Harry from a different point than canon, more 'academic' or more stupid to shed light about a other character like a female one or a more rational one, or another that they are fan. so I understand your pain, but these types of fics distinct from the canon are an increasingly common reality that we old fans need to get used to...
