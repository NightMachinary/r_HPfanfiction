It's because this type of fics are mostly written by nerdy teenagers whose world is split into bookworms and (to quote a classic) "horny simpletons". Growing up with the Harry Potter books I thought so too at first. But JKR being a bit more mature than I was when the original books were released, kind of made it obvious that the three main characters were meant to complement each other and they were smart in different aspects. Of course the obvious one was Hermione because she had a lot of knowledge, then it was Harry who was quick-witted, practical and talented at new spells, then it was Ron who was (most of the times), like his father, a people's person with a wordly knowledge. My headcanon is that the trio is meant to emphasize different aspects of human: Hermione is the wisdom (quite realistic since most people lose their composure in dire situations), Harry is the moral compass (because he is the fool who carries his heart on a sleeve and often makes stupid decisions based on what he think is right) and Ron is the human nature (friendly, pleasant, yet at the same time insecure, jealous, sometimes even vile). All three of them are so good at what they do but most of the younger people who get involved into this fandom only appreciate Hermione's smartness (movies also influenced this).
