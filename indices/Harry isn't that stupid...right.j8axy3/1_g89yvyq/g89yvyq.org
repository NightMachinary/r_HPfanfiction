Though I agree Harry is intelligent, and that fanfics that dumb him down are usually unentertaining, I disagree with you that almost being sorted into Slytherin had anything to do with it.

  Also I always imagined the Sorting Hat detected the presence of that piece of soul when Harry first tried it on. Because it was strongly tempted to put him in Slytherin. So that's how I see it.

Beyond the influence of the horcrux when it comes to the sorting, being in Slytherin isn't necessarily a mark of intelligence. You can be ambitious and an absolute idiot. You can be cunning but fail with a lot of your deceit because of low intelligence.
