  Draco was outright surprised in canon by Polyjuiced Harry being able to read.

That's just the movie, not the books, so not really canon. And I don't recall when/if they were accused of holding their wands backwards, but it sounds more like a generic insult than something that literally happened.

And they both ended up being good at the Unforgivables and other Dark Arts.

So yes, Crabbe and Goyle are dumb, but probably not quite as dumb as people tend to think.
