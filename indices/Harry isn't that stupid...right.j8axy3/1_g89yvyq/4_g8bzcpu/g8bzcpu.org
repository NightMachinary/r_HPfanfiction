I recall a fic where it stated that the majority of abused children go into either Slytherin or Hufflepuff, depending on how they've dealt with said abuse. Hufflepuff got the ones that withdrew and avoided conflict, while Slytherin got the ones that tended to be more resentful and defiant and find ways around their abusers. Given what we see of Harry early in PS/SS, he's clearly more the latter.
