Yeah I always felt due to the way he was raised he was more focused on doing things himself, rather than get help or look for much guidance from people other than maybe 2 or 3 people aside from Ron and Hermione, especially after the first book where no one believed him. I felt because of that he was always observant with things around him, he would do his best to read people and the situation. it also made him very quick witted due to dealing with Dudley. I also always loved his sarcastic/dark humor, I wish we had more of it in the films although I think fics by this point have written dark humor for Harry more than the original.
