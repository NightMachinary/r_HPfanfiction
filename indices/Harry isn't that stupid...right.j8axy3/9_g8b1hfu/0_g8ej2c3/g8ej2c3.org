I mean... he's a kid who had known, until Hogwarts, very little happiness. The way I see it, being at Hogwarts, hanging out with Ron and Hermione... It must have felt like summer vacation to him. I can't fault him for throwing every tiny moment he had to having fun.

Besides that, he really wasn't as bad as you make him out to be. His work ethic as it applies to his academic performance, is pretty much average. His practical performans above average even. No, he's not a genius. He's an average Joe who can accomplish what he sets his mind to when he focuses.
