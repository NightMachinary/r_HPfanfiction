I would agree that canon Harry isn't stupid, but that doesn't mean he's some secret genius either. I would argue that, more than anything, he has a rather spotty learning ethic (only ever seemingly focusing on studying when it relates to whatever current plot-induced crisis he's currently facing), and a rather annoying tendancy to get swept up into the moment (he seems to forget that someone deliberately entered his name into the Goblet of Fire for potentially nefarious reasons somewhere between the First and Third Tasks).
