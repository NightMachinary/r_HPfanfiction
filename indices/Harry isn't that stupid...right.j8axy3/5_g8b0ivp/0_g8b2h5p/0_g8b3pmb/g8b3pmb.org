an exceeds expectation isn't a B, it has its own context within the wizarding world

EE:

#+begin_quote
  "Well done --- a most creditable performance! We are impressed by the breadth of your magical knowledge and your level of insight into the wizarding world."
#+end_quote

and you can't compare GPA to hogwarts grades lol. they exist within different cultural contexts and levels of difficulty.

the wizarding world clearly doesn't care that people fail one class (divination) if their desire is to be an auror etc.

imo i think getting an EE involves significantly more difficulty than getting an A.
