Hello !

If I had to add something, I'd say : O looks more like a perfect grade than a simple A. In European schools, it'd be like this :

O = 20/20 or higher, maybe (the fabled "so good it can't be noted fairly"). It's a perfect understanding of the subject.\\
EE : >16/20 - you know enough to outclass most of the other classmates.\\
A : > 12/20 - You've been able to pass by. You know enough to not make a mockery of yourself, but you're not good.\\
D : > 8/20 - If you tried, then you're just not good at it.\\
P : > 4/20 - You didn't try, and didn't have natural talent as your friend.\\
T : < 4/20 - You really tried to fail.

In that case, Harry would have managed really high scores in the classes that mattered.
