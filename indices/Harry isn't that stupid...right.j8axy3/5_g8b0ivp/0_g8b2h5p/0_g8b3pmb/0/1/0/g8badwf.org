All of that is fanon, right next to wards. Canon magic seems to be much less sophisticated. For example, the patronus, a NEWT level charm which many adult wizards cannot cast even in dementor-free conditions involves merely

1. Remembering a happy memory.
2. Waving your wand in a circle
3. Saying Expecto Patronum

Simpler spells such as bombarda simply moving the wand in a predetermined fashion and saying a certain incantation. Essays and the theory part seem to cover when and how you would use which spell to achieve what you want.

Finally, as I mentioned previously, EE was the perquisite for all of the NEWT level courses. The fact that Crabb and Goyle were still at Hogwarts after OWLS means that achieving an EE couldn't have been that hard.
