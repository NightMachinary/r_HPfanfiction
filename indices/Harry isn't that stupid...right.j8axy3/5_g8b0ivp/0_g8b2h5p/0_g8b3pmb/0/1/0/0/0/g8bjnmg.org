I feel like a lot of his argument is gasping at straws. For an example, I find it hard to believe that Harry reading a a book which "had superb, moving color illustrations of all the counter-jinxes and hexes it described" and improving at defense is strong evidence that theory is crucial to magic. Likewise, I find his justification for Harry being able to cast Sectumsempra in ignorance of its effects unconvincing. He starts off with the notion that you have a lot of spell-specific theory and somehow arrives at the conclusion that because Harry knows a lot about the dark arts /in general/ he can successfully cast a spell solely based off an incantum scribbled in the margin of a book.

I could go on, but ultimately, this is a tangent that is irrelevant to the original topic. Standards and by extension grades are ultimately relevant to the student population. The expectations at Stanford may be higher than the University of Phoenix, but both institutions share the same letter grading system. The point still stands that

1. The descriptions for O, EE, and A grades are functionally the same as the descriptions for A, B, and C.
2. EE is the minimum grade necessary to enter the upper level classes.
3. Virtually every student managed to get into NEWT classes, meaning that they achieved an EE or better.
