Harry's smart. I mean, in the first four books he's really smart, not in the text book learning way though. He's adaptable, quick thinking and cunning. He's flawed just like Hermione and Ron. But after Gof, I felt like JKR turned him into somewhat idiotic because she wanted a average guy hero. Along with making Hermione kinda perfect and Ron more moronic. Movies didn't help either, with stupid Ron and Mary Sue Hermione.
