I think its mostly just people comparing Harry to movies Hermione, and thinking that of Hermione can be a genius Mary Sue, then if Harry isn't on the same level he must be dumb as bricks, or at least as close as you can get without infringing on Ron's dumbness range.

I'd blame a mix of Mary sue movie hermione, and the fact that Fanfics are 80% power fantasies. The interaction just seems to result in dumb Harry Fanon, either as a way to juxtapose someone's OC, or to show off how much better their smart!Harry is compared to Canon.
