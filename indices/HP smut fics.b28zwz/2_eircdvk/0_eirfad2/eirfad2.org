I can vet. It's honestly not that hard - most HP smut fics that I've run into are 8th year and up. You can tell most of the time just by looking at the tags if that's going to be the case. As long as Voldemort is defeated I consider them "not children" anymore. Also the wizarding age of majority is 17, so they are considered adults within their own culture at that point, which is enough for me to not find it squicky.
