Omg I'm with you, I feel like James and Lily are written to be horrible, neglectful patents to Harry in almost every fic where they live (and they're practically always WBWL). I mean, they loved him enough to give their lives for him without a thought, I really can't see them in the way they're so popularly portrayed.

Sadly I don't know any fics where there's just domestic Potter family fluff :( But I like how this fic subverts the WBWL trope: linkao3(1115311)
