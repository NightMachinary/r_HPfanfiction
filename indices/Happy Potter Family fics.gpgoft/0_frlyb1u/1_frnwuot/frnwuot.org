  I mean, they loved him enough to give their lives for him without a thought, I really can't see them in the way they're so popularly portrayed.

It's fanon. If you remember canon and the part with the Mirror of Erised, you can get a short insight into how JKR portrayed James and Lily.

There's also the part in PoA where Harry can hear the final moments of James and Lily's lives. Of course, it's validation for what you said earlier, and they'd never have given up their lives so willingly had they been horrible neglectful parents.

Let's also not forget the part from GoF (I think? It's been such a long time since I've read canon) where Lily and James are proud and supportive of Harry.

Then there's also that bit in DH towards the end when Harry turns the Resurrection Stone and sees James, Lily, Sirius and Remus.

Canon is full of examples of how James and Lily were loving parents, but it's become fanon that they're horrible parents which seems to be a major part of the wrong BWL trope and independent!Harry or Slytherin!Harry tropes.

And I'm just remembering, but in the first book, McGonagall, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Flitwick, The Fat Lady (I think? I'm not sure on this one) and even Slughorn in book 6 all mention bits and bobs of James and Lilys personalities. It most definitely goes against the trope of them being horrible parents IMO
