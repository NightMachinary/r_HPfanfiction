There's the What A Difference A Father Makes series - but the relationship dynamic between James and Harry does not feel like that between father-son. I don't think any father would let their 14 yo son talk to him in the manner that Harry does to James in this fic.

Other than this, it's an okayish fic. linkffn(5071058)
