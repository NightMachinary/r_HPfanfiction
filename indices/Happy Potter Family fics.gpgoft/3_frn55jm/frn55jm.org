The only fix like this that I can think of is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][The Prince of Slytherin]] . Lily and James are not bad people in this, and neither is Harry's wbwl twin. But Lily and James are more mixed about the quality of their parenting. It's very long and the author does tend to make things extremely complicated and there are a lot of add-one and OoCM but it's not bad in the end.
