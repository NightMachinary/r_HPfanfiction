Yeah, I agree. I mean, I guess it makes sense because there couldn't be a WBWL who is shunted aside for his twin brother if the parents are any good, but still.

Actually, that reminds me of something else I'd like to see, WBWL fics where Harry's brother loves him and is not a gigantic prat. I think I read one recently where Harry's parents are still dead and Harry's not treated very well by most other people (he's Slytherin) but his twin brother loves him very much and Harry loves him too.
