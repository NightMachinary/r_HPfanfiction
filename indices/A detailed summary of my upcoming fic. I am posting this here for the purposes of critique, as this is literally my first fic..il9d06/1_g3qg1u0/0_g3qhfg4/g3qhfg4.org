Well, its actually magitech. The ATH has somehow fused magic and technology together. I understand your concern about guns, so I'll limit it to ceremonial uses only. The magic only SEEMS to be reduced, because there just plain are fewer magicals than mundane in the HP universe. The ATH must be apocalyptic in terms power, while the muggles also have to have a role here as well. There just plain are more muggles than wizards, but magic will indeed have a major effect on the war.
