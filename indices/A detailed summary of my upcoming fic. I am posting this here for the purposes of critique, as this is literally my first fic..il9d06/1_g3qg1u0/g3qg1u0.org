To resummarize the comments I made last time - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/i7t0j8/why_are_there_no_fics_about_a_mugglewizard/g14nag5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]], I don't think there are inherent issues with a muggle-wizard alliance.

However, I do see issues with the magic in the story. Wizards using guns is incredibly off-putting to me, though this is subjective.

What is more odd is that you would base a story around wizards and muggle cooperating against an external threat and reduce the magic (the key part of being a wizard) used in the story. This is more of an objective criticism.

I'd note that I'd take a spell that can be silently cast where aim is based on skill with magic that instantly kills over a weapon that's difficult to master, can jam, and has far less stopping power. Hell, even blasting curses, inconsistent in canon, are probably better choices than a gun.

I think your main issues are going to follow a similar pattern, where your themes and storylines clash with each other and amongst each other.

There's a massive focus on this "Army of True Humanity" and technology, and while that's fine approach, it definitely nerfs magic, and honestly existing muggle powers as well, especially if mundane forces can actually threaten magical protections (which we know override mundane nature in canon). It really feels like this story will be its own story with Harry Potter characters and a little magic thrown in for spice.

I'd recommend really taking a second look at Harry Potter and strengthening the elements of it in your story. This really feels like something I'd find on HFY and technology-wank. This isn't bad, but I'm really unsure that Harry Potter is the best medium for this.
