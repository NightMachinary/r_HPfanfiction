Its just a general summary. 'Characterization' is for the outline. 'Doesn't sound respectful of what the holocause was like for jews' how exactly? Again, its supposed to be grimdark. Its not going to be gratuitous violence with no humanity. It will be grimdarkness with a happy ending. They won't have to be fans of HOI4 to like the fic. TNO is very narrative-heavy, to the point where its almost like a book with a video game portion. I really feel like your definition of 'wank' is quite broad.
