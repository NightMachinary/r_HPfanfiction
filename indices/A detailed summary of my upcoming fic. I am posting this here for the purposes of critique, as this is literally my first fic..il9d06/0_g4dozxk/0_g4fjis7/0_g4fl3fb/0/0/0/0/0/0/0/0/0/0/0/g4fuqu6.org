'Read actual literature'. Apparently the Hunger Games is more real literature than Star Wars books. I am not looking to be the next Tolkein, just write a Military Fantasy story people enjoy. Character development is character development, no matter where it originates. It could be in a book, a movie(Golden age films did this very well), a tv show, or even an immersive theater experience. The Star Wars novels, WERE books before they were movies, atleast the non-novelizations were.
