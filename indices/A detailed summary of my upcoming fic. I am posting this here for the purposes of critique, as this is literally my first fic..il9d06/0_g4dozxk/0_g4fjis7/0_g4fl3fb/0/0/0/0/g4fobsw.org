By using acronyms for games most people have never heard of, you make your post sound confusing. You're talking about games when thinking about a written story. Try reading some books before you start writing. Books are not video games and they need different things.

From the description given, you have no real characters. To get people to read, you have to have interesting characters at the forefront. Without well developed characters, you have cardboard cutouts fighting for no reason.

I describe this as militaristic wank because that's exactly what it is. It's gratuitous violence and weaponry purely for the sake of it. What little plot there is is buried a mile deep in a post apocalyptic landscape. There are no characters.

Try reading the Hunger Games. Why did people like them? There were distinct, rounded characters. Katniss was a flawed, but real human. We know what motivates her to do the things she does, her baby sister.

Try reading 1984. Why do Julia and Winston rebel? Why is it one of the giants of English literature? Because the characters are fantastic and the story is cleverly plotted.

Your summary meets none of those things. Scrap it entirely. Come up with a character and explore from their perspective. Have you ever read a story without characters?
