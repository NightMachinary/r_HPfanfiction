So I should start with characters? That makes sense. Well, lets start off with Voldemort, or Tom Riddle as he's known in this timeline. What motivates him to fight is seeing dozens of British Wizards killed by German wizards, and being put into a Labor Camp for several years. This gives him a burning hatred of Germany, and a distrust of the United States, due to its cowardice being the reason behind the Allies losing the Second World War. Or, what about the MACUSA President? They, whoever they are, fight because they are trying to redeem MACUSA after its security forces failed to prevent the assasination of the ICW General Assembly. This sound good?
