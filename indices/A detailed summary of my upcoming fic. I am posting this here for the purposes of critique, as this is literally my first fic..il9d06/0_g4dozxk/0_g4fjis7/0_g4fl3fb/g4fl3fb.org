Another load of wank. It doesn't sound well researched. It doesn't sound respectful of what the holocaust was actually like for Jews. It sounds like a load of gratuitous violence with no thought given to the human element.

Making Voldemort the good guy? What? That needs some serious explanation.

It doesn't sound like a strong narrative. I can see no mention of any kind of characterisation.

So far as I can tell, house of Iron 4 is a fairly niche video game. Most people haven't heard of it. Those that have probably aren't interested in shitty Harry Potter fanfic. Your potential audience is tiny. It's fans of house of iron who are also Harry Potter fans who would read fanfic. In other words, just you.

Come up with an idea that meets the basis of a good story. Actually read some dystopia fiction before trying to write it yourself.
