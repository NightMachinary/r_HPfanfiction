My other idea is a fic set in the world of The New Order: Last Days of Europe, a mod for HOI4 with a strong narrative element. I personally like that one more. It's a very dark world, where the Axis won WW2.

My thinking would be that Grindelwald was never born in this timeline, along with Roosevelt dying and Bukharin winning the Soviet election. This results in German wizards joining with Hitler, due to the anti-semitism ingrained in German Wizarding culture(Wizards went underground back when anti-semitism was far, far worse than it was in the 20th century). The Axis win WW2, and the Wizards are exposed to the world, due to the ICW's conference being destroyed by the German wizards. Tom Riddle leads a British Resistance against the Axis, as apart of Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance.

MACUSA joins with the United States Government.

In the mod, there is a nation known as Burgundy, a nation so bad I really don't want to even think about it. They are like Nazi germany, but far, far worse. Its like if Orwell's oceania had a baby with the SS. In fact, they are run by the SS, and plot to destroy humanity in nuclear fire, so that the 'pure Aryan race' can survive and inherit the Earth.

What do you think about that?
