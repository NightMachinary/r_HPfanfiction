The problem I see is that a wand will listen to the wizard and act to cast a spell no matter which hand is holding it, so you'll get the same spell being cast from both wands. Great if you're trying to banish someone with a lot of force, as Harry did when casting with three wands against Greyback, but potentially disastrous for anyone tossing out, say, fiendfyre, which is already difficult to control.

I do see a need for Dragon handlers to have a backup six-shooter wand bundle, so they can Stun those vicious Hungarian Horntails when they get uppity, but they'd best keep it holstered at all other times.
