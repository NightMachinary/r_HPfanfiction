Consider the above video showing how dual-wielding pistols performs under controlled circumstances. It's kinda sketchy and takes a lot of focus for not much advantage in target points.

Now imagine trying to do that in a combat scenario where you're running around and getting shot-at. Unless you're Lara-fucking-Croft or Keanu Reeves you're probably not going to hit much of anything.

Now swap the pistols for wands, wand-movements, and extra casting-related concentration. I presume trying to aim while doing wand movements with one wand is tricky to begin with. and unless you've got a crazy magical multitasking brain you'd probably only be able to cast the same spell from both wands if you want to cast simultaneously and wouldn't see any rate of fire improvements over a single wand if you alternated.

Conclusion: I don't think it would work out so well outside of a shooting range or a wizarding action-novel.
