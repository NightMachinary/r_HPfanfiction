A big part of learning spells is to get the muscle memory for the precise movements. You'll probably only learn to cast with one of your hands, just like most people can only write with one hand. Coordinating precise movements of two hands at once is probably more difficult than just casting with one hand more quickly. Also, you can only speak one incantation at a time.
