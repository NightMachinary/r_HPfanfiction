I think Harry probably got really lucky there. A lot of the points in this thread are forgetting the fact that wands have their own, for lack of a better word, "personality". Wands can switch ownership, not work well, malfunction, or in some cases be dangerous to the caster. The wand chooses the wizard, why would we assume they would be happy being 1 of multiple.

The explanation could be as simple as no one wants to risk their wand being tempermental if they feel slighted by the fact that you feel the need to use multiple wands at once. As per the final clash with the elder wand we know even spells like the killing curse can be reflected back on the caster if the wand acts up, just how dangerous could it be if 2 wands decide to act up at once.
