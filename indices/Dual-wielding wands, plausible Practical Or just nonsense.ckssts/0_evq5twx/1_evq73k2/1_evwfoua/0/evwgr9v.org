In the movies, maybe, because the actors couldn't be bothered and/or it would have been a bit silly. But when reading, I never assumed that people stopped doing the wand movements just because they're not described to use every time, any more than I assume people simply hover from Point A to Point B if the narration fails to specify that they do so by putting one front of the other, and then repeating.
