Even then, casting spells is clearly not just a matter of doing the right motion with your wand. You have to say the incantation (or at least think it) and concentrate on intent of some sort. Your left hand alone can't cast /Protego/, you have to be thinking /about/ the spell as you move the hand.

So it's just about imaginable that you could cast the same spell in both directions at once, but, I think, unworkable to cast two /different/ spells at once.
