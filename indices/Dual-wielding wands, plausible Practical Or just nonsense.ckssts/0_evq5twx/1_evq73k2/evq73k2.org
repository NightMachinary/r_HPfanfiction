  In canon, it's probably safe to assume that it wouldn't work because we never see anyone doing so. Voldemort, for example, has no reason not to world the Deathstick and his old yew wand at the same time.

What about "Lord Voldemort is not ambidextrous"? Even assuming it's theoretically possible to cast with two wands at once, it would necessitate someone who, in the heat of battle, is able to perfectly form wand movements with /both hands/, simultaneously.

It's also impractical for a host of reasons such as: having a free hand is /useful/; even if you can cast in two directions, you probably can't /aim/ in two directions at once, so fat lot of good this is in a duel; assuming you /can/, effortfully, work out the necessary concentration to successfully cast two spells at once, that concentration might nevertheless be better used elsewhere; etc.
