Well I imagine like anything else it's a skill that must be learned and if you aren't proficient with it you wouldn't bring it into battle because it would be a detriment.

I think it's theoretically possible but it would be just stupid complex, imagine trying to do wand motions with both hands simultaneously while also aiming. I mean shit a lot of people struggle to rub their belly and pat their heads at the same time. That doesn't even get into intent and concentration of spells either.
