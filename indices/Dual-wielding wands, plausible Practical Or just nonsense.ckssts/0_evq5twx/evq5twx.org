In canon, it's probably safe to assume that it wouldn't work because we never see anyone doing so. Voldemort, for example, has no reason not to world the Deathstick and his old yew wand at the same time.

In a fic, it's not something I mind as long as we have a reason why not everyone is doing so - maybe it takes incredible power, or unusual abilities to split one's attention. But being able to curse with one hand and shield with the other is a massive advantage on the battlefield.
