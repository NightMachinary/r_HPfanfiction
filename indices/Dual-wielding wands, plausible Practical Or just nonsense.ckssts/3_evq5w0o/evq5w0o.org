I doubt that it is possible to cast two spells at once, given that they seem to require some degree of concentration. However, we do see someone in the Battle of Hogwarts holding two wands pressed against one another and casting a Stunner with this double-wand, which results in a more powerful Stunner; so I think it's in the realm of possibility that with really good coordination, you could cast two of the same spell at once, reciting the incantation once while using each of the two wands to make identical wand movements.

This /would/ require perfect or near-perfect synchronicity, though, and doesn't sound very practical even then (what about aiming?). You /can/ imagine circumstances where it'd come in handy in a fight --- casting two /Arania Exumai/s simultaneously if you're surrounded by approaching Acromantulas, say --- but I think it'd more likely be a neat party trick available to ambidextrous wizards rather than a casting style you could just choose to use on a regular basis.
