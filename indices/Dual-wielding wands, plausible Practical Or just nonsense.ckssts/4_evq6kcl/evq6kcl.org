I think that it may be possible, but I think it would most likely end up with the spell failing or the wands to be damaged. In my head it's like someone trying to punch with both hands at the same time, not very effective. What I want to ask is why would you want to use two wands? It's not going to make your spells anymore powerful, if anything they'd be weaker or unstable. Maybe, MAYBE it could be useful, but I just can't see how.
