This is where I think fan fiction and cannon get murky.

Cannon is unclear about the possibility (although it's doubtful). We're sort of beholden to what JK says can happen and can't depending on her mood and what she decided to Recon/put in fantastic beasts. Up until book 6 we didn't really know how people learned to cast silently. It's not really ever clarified if they have to have wand movements on top of that or if it's just another more advanced step to get rid of that too.

Personally I prefer a Brandon Sanderson or Patrick Rothafuss model for magic systems. Defined rules and understanding of magic but it's also a flexible system which allows talented characters to stretch what's possible.

On the other hand it's one of the reasons there's so much HP fan fiction. JKR built a reasonable base of lore, decent magic system, and a world filled with amazing characters and then she sort of just skimmed the surface.

If you (or any other author) can make dual wielding make sense/work based on sound reasoning or good explanation (say like Kvothe splitting his mind in name of the wind) then why not? Base magic on creativity and a connection with your wand rather than Latin words and weird motions. Or make it mandatory that all spells must be yodled and performed with giant rubber dildos. Knock yourself out.
