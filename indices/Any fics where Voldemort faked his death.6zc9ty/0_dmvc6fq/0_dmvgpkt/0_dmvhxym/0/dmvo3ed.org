One of them was where Dumbledore created Voldemort and Grimdewald to increase his influence and retired them to a beach side villa in France or something with their wives when it was time for them to be defeated. Can't find it though. I think it was on archiveofourown if that helps.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10129276/1/][The Dangerous and Deadly Voldemort]] was the other. Tom Riddle never actually exists in it.
