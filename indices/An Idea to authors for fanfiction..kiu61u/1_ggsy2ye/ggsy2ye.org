  /Dumbledore sees this and under the pretext of Harry needing to be safe, needing them to focus on the B(G)WL and Harry needing to be away from magic so the dark magic that is attached to him(Horcrux) to fade, Dumbledore convinces Lily and James to leave Harry at the Dursleys./

I don't think it's logical for Dumbledore to be stepping into the picture and calling the shots when all this time Lily was asking for help from Vivian. True, Lily doesn't remember that the rituals for protection were cast but there was the earlier deal helping her and James conceive children, which, looking back at what you've written, shouldn't be part of what was erased from her mind.

This notion of the Potters having twins (or children other than Harry) then neglecting one for the other because of Dumbledore has been done [[https://m.fanfiction.net/community/Wrong-BoyWhoLived/18135/][a hundred times before]], it has become uninteresting.

Perhaps you could straight up have Lily and James give Harry back to Vivian after Voldemort's attack since he really is her child anyway? Then make him encounter the monkey and the tear while wandering away from his safe spot in fae land and have him go on all the adventures you listed afterwards. I didn't understand what you wrote because I don't know any of the original sources you were referring to but with the long list of things you outlined, your Harry's already interesting enough even without the tragic "neglected twin sent off to the Dursleys" background.
