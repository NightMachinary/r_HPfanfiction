I usually suggest for Hinny beginners [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Nineteen Years and Beyond by Northumbrian]], start with linkao3(Tales of the Battle by Northumbrian) and go on.

And yes, [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][problem with Hinny]] is that it is horribly (and just insufficiently) written in the books, so most of the romance has to be written by the fanfiction authors. There is just not enough in the books, because JKR cannot write romance to get herself out of the wet paper bag.

Also, stories by [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Mrs_Granger]].
