I haven't read it yet, so I don't know how well it meets your request, but linkffn(Dark Repercussions by Jessicaa15) has an evil Harry.

linkffn(The Birth of Evil by DisobedienceWriter) may also suit your tastes.

And it's crack, but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rise of the Evil Overlord by Maestro Hazard) is fun and has a Dark Lord Harry.
