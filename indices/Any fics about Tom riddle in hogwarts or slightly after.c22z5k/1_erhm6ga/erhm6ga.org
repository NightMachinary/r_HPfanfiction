Linkffn(The Evil Overlord List)

Tom has a voice in his head who calls himself Jerry. Jerry got a weird sense of humor and knows a bunch of things he shouldn't. He's pretty much an evil variant of the "guy who read the books dropped into the HP verse" trope.

Together, Tom & Jerry attempt to take over the world.
