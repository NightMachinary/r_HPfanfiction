Time travel fic where a powerful adult Harry decides to kill Riddle before he gets dangerous. (Basically a variation on the "would you kill baby Hitler" idea.)

Suddenly Harry is the feared dark lord obsessed with killing a schoolkid, and Tom is getting mentored by Dumbledore in how to avoid getting killed by the dark lord.
