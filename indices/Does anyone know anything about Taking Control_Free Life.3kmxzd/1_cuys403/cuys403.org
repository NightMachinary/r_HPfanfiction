I'd assume that Free Life is abandoned at this point. Someone rec'd a sequel (by another author) to me [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=129801&chapter=1&textsize=5][The Prevailing Counterpoint by GHL]]. I read a bit of it but I hadn't read TC or FL in ages so I couldn't get into it. I'll try again once I've done a reread of them.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/][Brennus]] writes Harry/Ginny stories that feel pretty similar to Matt's stuff (light to heavy bashing, powerful Harry, "us against the world" feel, etc).
