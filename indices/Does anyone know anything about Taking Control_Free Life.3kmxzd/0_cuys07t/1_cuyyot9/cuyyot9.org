I'm kind of disappointed by TPC to be honest. It had way too many unnecessary scenes, I think. It started out well, but then it's just endless chapters of classes (look how much of a leader Harry is!), special stuff Ginny comes up with, like extra quidditch matches and meetings (look how awesome Ginny is!).

It took the fun out of the story for me. The author gave Harry and Ginny, who are still 16 and 15, way too much responsibility, which is boring. It slows the story down and it gives you too many factors to think of before going into the action.
