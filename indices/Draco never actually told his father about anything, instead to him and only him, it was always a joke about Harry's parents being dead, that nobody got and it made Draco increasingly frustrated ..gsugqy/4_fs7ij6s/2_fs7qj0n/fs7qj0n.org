Draco told to Harry that his parents went with the wrong sort of people (and see where it got them) litterally seconds after (officialy) meeting him. He also took delight in the fact that Harry stayed at Hogwarts for Christmas (in PS) and spent time loudly mentioning how nice it was to have people who wanted him at home every time Harry was near.

And I don't even mention his apparent delight in the "Heir of Slytherin" actions during CoS, or how he talked about Molly Weasley. Draco /may/ have found an heart during the Blood war, but before this he was a complete asshole with no care about how he hurt people.
