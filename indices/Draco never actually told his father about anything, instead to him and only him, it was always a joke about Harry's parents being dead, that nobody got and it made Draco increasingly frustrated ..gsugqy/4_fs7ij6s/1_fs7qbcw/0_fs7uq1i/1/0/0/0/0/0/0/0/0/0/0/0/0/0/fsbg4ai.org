Let's try again with different words and a much longer explanation. What I meant by "There is a universe of difference between saying I want to kill someone physically kill someone" is that Draco speaks, not that he is a serial killer who kills people or actually thinks he is killing someone. He doesn't even think he really wants to kill them or cause someone to die (a striking example of this is everything that happened with Dumbledore). Draco talks and a lot, but it's all smoke and no roast. He never felt cold-blooded about killing someone. It wasn't even a cruel joke to say what he said when the cat was found petrified, but just a very stupid thing. And he may have said it either because he was afraid and hid it behind hatred (people often mask fear with hatred, just to react or conceal it) or to bully. Basically, you and I have a very similar thought about Draco, only that I add the plus of fear to his mix of emotions. But I never thought that Draco was heartless or emotionless, in fact, he is completely the opposite.
