That's pretty much the heart of it, I don't understand why your first answer was about the difference between saying "I want something" and actually doing it.

I think that takes us back to "I don't see how that matters, though. We're not saying the guy's a killer. We're saying he's heartless and he'd make jokes about people's dead parents."
