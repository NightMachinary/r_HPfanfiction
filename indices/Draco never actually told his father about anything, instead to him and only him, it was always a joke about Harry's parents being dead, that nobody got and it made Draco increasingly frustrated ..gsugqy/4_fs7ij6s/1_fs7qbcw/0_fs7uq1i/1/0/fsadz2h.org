There is a universe of difference between saying that you want to kill someone and kill someone. Just think about how it ended with Dumbledore. I'm not saying that Draco hadn't rooted pureblood ideas in his head and wasn't selfish. But he was not even a cold-blooded killer, he was a frightened child (even at sixteen) and everything he did, did it out of fear not out of a thirst for blood.
