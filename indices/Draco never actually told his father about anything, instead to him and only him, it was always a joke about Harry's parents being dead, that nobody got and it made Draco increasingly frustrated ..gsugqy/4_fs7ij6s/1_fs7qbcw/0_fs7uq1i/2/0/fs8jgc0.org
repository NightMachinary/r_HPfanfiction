I'm all for stoning Nazis, but there's some leniency to be given to a child. Like Draco's a kid for most of the books - painting him as an redeemable Nazi /at twelve/ just is wrong to me.

As for his realization in canon, I don't know - I got the impression that he was uncomfortable with what was being asked the more it moved away from just schoolyard posturing. Like, he didn't kill Dumbledore - that had nothing to do with it threatening him or his family personally, in fact killing him would have done the opposite.

What I'd say is more appropriate for Draco is that for a long time, it wasn't /real/ for him - it was all a game, where whatever heinous things his side did didn't really affect him personally and was good. Then, when it /did/ start to actually involve him and affect him, that's when he started at least somewhat pulling away from it.

Which seems fairly appropriate for his age throughout the series, too.
