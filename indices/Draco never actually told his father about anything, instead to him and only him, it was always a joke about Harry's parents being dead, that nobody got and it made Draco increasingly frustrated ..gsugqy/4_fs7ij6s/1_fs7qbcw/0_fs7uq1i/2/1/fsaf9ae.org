Draco really believes in pureblood supremacy, he would believe it even in the face of clear evidence to the contrary. I can't see Draco volunteering to become a Death Eater if Lucius hadn't failed. With his personality, I would have seen him live more in the reflected glory of his father's position. Draco didn't want to get his hands dirty, I would have seen him supporting without ever acting. Edit: pureblood, sorry for the lapsus
