Children are cruel and often don't even know what they are saying. If Draco had found a mudblood dead at twelve, I doubt he would have celebrated. Maybe he would pretend later, and pretend so hard that he was convinced that he had actually celebrated, that he had been a true Slytherin and a true pureblood. While in truth he would have been just scared.
