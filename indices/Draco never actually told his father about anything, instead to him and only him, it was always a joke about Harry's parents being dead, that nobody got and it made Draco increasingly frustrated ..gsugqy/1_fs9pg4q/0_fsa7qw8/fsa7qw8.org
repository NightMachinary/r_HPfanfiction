  ‘I do feel so sorry,' said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, ‘for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're not wanted at home.'

  He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that Slytherin had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he'd realised that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.

Chapter 12, The Mirror of Erised (yeah... the chapter where he saw his family in the mirror, ouch), Philosopher's Stone.

So it's canon that Draco has a terrible taste at joking, and he's /also/ relentlessly mock Harry for not having a "proper" family (honestly, that's rich coming from an only child with no aunt from her mother side because one of them marry a Muggle-born while the other is a crazed criminal). So, um, why didn't Draco get into a violent "accident"? I know Neville was the biggest pushover, but he's practically an orphan because of Draco's aunt & uncle. Susan's family lost a lot of members, the Aurors were cleared to use the Unforgivables, so we know during the skirmish plenty of people on both sides have died. With everyone being related, how come not a single student, feeling gloomy after the anniversary of their parents/favorite aunt/uncle/grandparents' death during the war, snapped and levitated Draco after his umpteenth "tee hee, orphans, amirite"?
