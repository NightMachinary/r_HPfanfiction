That's an interesting angle on the impact more widely.

I think if we want a real world analogue of what it would have been like afterwards you'd need comparisons with Rwanda or the like. If one part of a society is violently murdering another part it doesn't end with some fireworks and parties when the head guy dies and everyone goes back to school together and it's fine.

I don't think I've seen people talk too much about the damage that must have done to the culture.
