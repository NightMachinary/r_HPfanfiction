  Draco Malfoy accepted Dumbledore's offer of help at the top of the Astronomy Tower too late to prevent what he had started. He escaped Hogwarts with Severus Snape who, instead of taking him home hid him away where the Order could protect him. Now he is forced to confront his worst fears and decide what kind of Wizard he wants to be.
