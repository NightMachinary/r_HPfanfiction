The Rowling Hot Take numbers, as usual, make no sense, so let's throw them out.

Inbreeding shouldn't be a problem as even with a population as small as 160 it can be effectively controlled.

We can do some calculations:

Start off with Hogwarts having 40 students per year, 10 per house. We know that not every magical person gets a spot at Hogwarts, some get homeschooled, some go to other schools. To try and establish a cap, let's say 50% of wizards in Brittain go to Hogwarts. That means there are 80 new magical people per year. We also know that aging doesn't quite work the same. Dumbledore is quite old and one of the examiners mentions she was the examiner for him when he was in school, so magical people seem to be able to live very long. Let's say 100 years is typical barring violent death, or a potential population of 8000 in Brittain with Hogwarts as a sole school. This could put us at 1,000,000 wizards worldwide. If we say that Hogwarts is the premier school, but not the only one in the UK, we can adjust this arbitrarily high.

I like to think of the magical population being fixed, rather than proportional to the broader population, which allows us to sidestep issues of a vanishingly small population as you go back in time. I like to think that exactly 7001 magical children are born every year globally, because it's a fun prime number and gets us to a reasonable point for 40 new students at hogwarts every year.
