In my head canon Harry's class is smaller than the average class and Hogwarts isn't the only school in Britain. To me the idea that the magical population has been around 2,000 plus years and that there is little to no population growth is crazy. They have magic to help with crops, hunting, healthcare and many other things so there is no reason the population would be so small.

Like you said Rowling's math wasn't great.
