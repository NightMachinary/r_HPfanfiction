I think the Harry is an unreliable narrator idea helps the most with this. The main character sees a much smaller sliver of the world compared to a normal person so naturally we wouldn't know a lot. For all we know there are multiple shopping areas, communities, schools etc but since Harry was never curious enough, through Rowling, we have no idea.

Most families in canon seem to have 1-3 kids so population growth would be slow but with the injection of muggleborns it would grow.
