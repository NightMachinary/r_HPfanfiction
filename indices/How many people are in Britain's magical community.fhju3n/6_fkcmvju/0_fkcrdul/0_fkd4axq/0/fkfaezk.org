Ya only thing I can think of is maybe on average 1/4 or so kids that are born to magical parents actually have magic themselves. So the kids we see at Hogwarts are the lucky ones. As for war those would have to be some big/frequent wars to constantly suppress the magical population for thousands of years. Maybe the witch trials in the middle ages did more damage than we thought and culled the population?
