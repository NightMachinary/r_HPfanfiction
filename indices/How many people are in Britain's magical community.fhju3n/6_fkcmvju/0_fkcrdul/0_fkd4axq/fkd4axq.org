Population growth is the real issue I think. It just doesn't fit with the rest. The math can be made to work for 10s of thousands to hundreds of thousands of wizards existing in the 90, but it doesn't explain such a stagnant population. With longer lifespans, wizarding population should grow decently well. I know a number of fics use the "witches generally only have 1 child" and "inbreeding caused infertility" excuses, but a population this small in the 90s doesn't make sense. Inbreeding is avoidable in populations greater than 50, genetic drift at 500. Wizarding population should have outgrown muggle population given longer lifespans. The only explanation is regular wars that cull the population, or a natural population equilibrium that is balanced by the births of squibs and muggleborn.
