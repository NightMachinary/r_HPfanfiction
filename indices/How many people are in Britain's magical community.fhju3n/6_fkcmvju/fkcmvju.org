As many as JK Rowling/You need there to be.

Now for Rowling that was as many as she needed at any given point, but a lot of writers and readers like more consistency then that, finding it in fanfiction when you can't find it in canon.

The main basis that most people use is Hogwarts. The population of Hogwarts is anywhere from 300-500 based on various estimates from canon indicators. While some notes or tweets or interviews mention upwards of 1000.

Based on populations, roughly adjusting for longer lifespan as well as population downturn due to three wars over the course of 40 years, a Hogwarts population of 300 only accounts for a British Wizarding population of a little more than 3000. Not quite the feeling that most people expect from the Magical World.

Popular adjustments are that the vast majority of magical children are home schooled and only some go to Hogwarts (due to cost, family ties, talent, whatever).

Or other magical schools exist in Britain, but Hogwarts is the premium school and not everyone can get in.

Or these other magical schools aren't boarding schools and a lot of parents prefer to keep their children at home.

Or a lot of British students attend school out of country

Or Harry is an unreliable narrator, and Hogwarts is significantly larger than described, with many students not being mentioned, and other teachers covering the same courses, Harry only talking about the teachers he has for all six years.

I have seen it done where the magical population really is that small and insular, and that its like a small backwards village, except the population is spread out in small groups around the country.

Personally, I enjoy Hogwarts as written, with one teacher per subject as in canon. This requires a small school population in order for those teachers to handle the course load. So the 300-500 seems fine to me. I like to imagine that a lot of families homeschool, and that a lot of them send their kids to wizarding "public schools" where they can floo over for the day and come home at night. The teachers at these schools not being the experts like Snape or McGonagal, but still decent enough to get students through standardized OWLs. Adding a number of these public schools allows the population of magical Britain to jump up to a point where canon feels valid.

I still think that the small town level of wizarding population makes the most sense though. How big of a population can possibly be supported by two main shopping centers? 10 to 30 thousand witches and wizards spread over the country works for having a few population centers like people living above shops in Diagon Alley or offshoot Alleys, as well as in Hogsmeade, and then smaller groups off of already small muggle villages such as Ottery St Catchpole and Godrics Hollow. The rest scattered throughout the countryside and isolated homes in muggle areas.
