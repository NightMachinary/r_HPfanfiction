yeah, i'd that is is true, cause Dumbledore was 115 and still fine besides the curse, Bathilda Bagshot was already an adult at least by the time Dumbledore was a kid and if Voldemort hadn't bothered her she would of been fine for a few years yet, the unnamed trolley witch is 190 by the Epilogue, and then there's Griselda Marchbanks who was already graduated and working as an examiner by the time Dumbledore does his owls/newts, and is still alive and doing fine by the time Harry does his owls (don't know for newts cause it never shows harry doing those) and then there is also newt scamandar who was born in 1897 and was still alive by the epilogue/2017
