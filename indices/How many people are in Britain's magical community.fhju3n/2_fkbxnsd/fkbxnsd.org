Hogwarts has about 850-900 students(How I got to that number is written [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/euotnx/how_bigsmall_is_the_harry_potter_universe_in_the/ffrkizq/?context=3][here]]), thats at least 120 per year. If we go by a average life expectancy of 100(we know wizards frequently become older than this, but just use this as average) then there would be at least 12000 wizards and witches in Britain, so it basically has the population of a large town, without including all the other magical beings( creatures like Hags, Goblins and Vampires) that live in Britain.

The civil war also becomes more viable if you actually look at the numbers on each side, like neither the Order of Phoenix nor the Death Eaters even have twenty members each, and we know Aurors only recruit the best and often spend years without recruiting people, so they probably have similar numbers. Also the Death Eaters weren't just randomly causing mass slaughters among wizards, they specifically targeted those who opposed them and their loved ones, overall I doubt they killed more than a few hundred, which in a population of 12000 is still devastating, but not impossibly so.
