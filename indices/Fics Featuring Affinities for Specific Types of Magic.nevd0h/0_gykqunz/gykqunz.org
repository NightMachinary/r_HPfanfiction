I really like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461][Evitative by Vichan]]. It goes into that dark/light affinity story without (in my opinion) becoming obnoxious. There is a bit of that secretly good Slytherin idea if you're not into that (honestly imo this fic actually keeps them assholes in a way but allows us to see on their side and be aware of the circumstances that shaped them etc... the important thing is they're not all death eaters).
