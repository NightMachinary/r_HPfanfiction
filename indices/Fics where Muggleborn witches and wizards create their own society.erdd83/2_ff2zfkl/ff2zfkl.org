There's this fic: linkffn(6523209) but it's sadly incomplete. Here's my (spoiler-free) review:

#+begin_quote
  You'll like this if you enjoy slightly cracky fics, really good worldbuilding, Muggles/Squibs not being complete tools or enemies, strong Harry/Hermione FRIENDSHIP, good trio dynamics all around, underground Muggleborn culture, Death Eaters defecting, and having a Harry that can think for himself.

  Fair warning, it paints Snape and the other DEs in a slightly sympathetic light, real-world plugins (Eminem and /Harry Potter/ meta), and somewhat unrealistic character interactions. There's also a bit of Muggle(born/raised) focus.

  Overall, I liked it. Just over 60k words and 19 chapters. Unfortunately, it's abandoned (last update was in 2014) but it's a refreshing change of pace.
