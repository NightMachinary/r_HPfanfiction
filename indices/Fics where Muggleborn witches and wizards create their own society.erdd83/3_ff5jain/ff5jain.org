Did you just request a story where the characters act in a way that shows common sense and a basic understanding of history and human civil liberties? I don't know man, it sounds fun, but based on most of the stuff I have seen it might be to hard for a fanfic writer. However, I like the idea. I think a good title for something based on this would be, The Muggleborn Revolution. I would also like to see them use technology more prominently since they all will know how useful it is.
