[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11196963/1/][/The Uprising/ by Captain Cranium]] is set several years after DH. It Harry returning to England after a long time, to learn that Hermione and other muggleborns have basically moved out and created a colony of their own in some magical area, and the wizarding government wants him to help deal with them.

It's well written and complete, but I think that I eventually lost interest and ever finished it. The author went out of his way to keep mentioning how powerful and special and important Harry was, which grated---I suspect that this is one of those stories that would work better if you "deleted" the lead character.
