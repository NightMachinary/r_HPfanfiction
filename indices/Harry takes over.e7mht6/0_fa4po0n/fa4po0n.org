In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13165325/1/Echoes-in-the-Fog][Echoes in the Fog]] Evil!Harry is the 2nd in command to Voldemort himself, but since for most of the work Voldemort is away from England, Evil!Harry is in charge. In this fic, Canon!Harry, Grey!Harry and friends get pulled into Evil!Harry's dimension. Chaos ensues.

I'd recommend reading the prequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13108396/1/For-Lack-of-a-Bezoar][For Lack of a Bezoar]] before reading Echoes in the Fog. For Lack of a Bezoar is a quick 35k word story detailing how Grey!Harry becomes during his 6th and 7th years. Essentially Ron doesn't get saved with a Bezoar in 6th year and Harry and Hermione both become darker as a result. Both fics are really good reads.

I've also heard that Marquis Black's /Emperor/ has Harry Potter as an emperor, but I've never read it so I can't say whether it's good or not.
