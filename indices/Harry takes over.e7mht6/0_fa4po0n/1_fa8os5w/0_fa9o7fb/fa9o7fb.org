I'll admit I was hoping for the appearance of the people in the other universe to force some kind of mass rebellion against Voldemort's rule. It didn't need to be 100% sucessful, but maybe if they could have liberated a few areas and cast doubt among the public about Voldemort's omnipotence. But I get that everybody was just looking for a way out of the situation because they were tired of fighting. Still though, IMO Echoes in the Fog is the fic with the best use of dimension hopping. It's not easy to take three different sets of characters and shove them all into the same world, so kudos to the author on that.
