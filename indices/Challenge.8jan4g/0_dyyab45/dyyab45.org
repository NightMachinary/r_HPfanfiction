Best I can do is link you to one of my incomplete fics that /somewhat/ hit the mark on a few points of yours.

Otherwise, I almost never see challenges be well received here. As in: few to no responses. Challenges seem to be more of a FFN thing, especially when they leave the realm of prompts and become these comission-type things.
