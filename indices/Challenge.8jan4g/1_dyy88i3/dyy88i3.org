Popularly it's called a prompt but I suppose challenge is fine. If you have any skill with writing then I would tell you to not wait for the elusive muse and just start writing.

Besides I have seen this done before so you'll probably get a recommendation. I don't remember it's name right now.

Sorry for being generally unhelpful.

For anyone picking up this prompt I would suggest making Ron go bad because of the brains. I hate Ron Bashing.
