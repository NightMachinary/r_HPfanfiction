Yeah, in fanfiction sites they are called challenges usually so its all good. More people call them challenge perhaps but I have never seen the word used in this subrreddit.

Yes, writing an essay and a story are different things but you should still give it a try when you can. In my experience you will never get that free month to do it so you have to steal some time and give it a try.
