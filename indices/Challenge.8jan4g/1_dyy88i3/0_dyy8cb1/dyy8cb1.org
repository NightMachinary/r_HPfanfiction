Ahh ok. I wasn't sure whether different places called it different. Like I've read paladeus's challenge response along with reptilia's.

Most authors that responded and answered called them challenges so there it goes lol.

As for writing I have a feeling I'm a fairly good writer. However that's usually for college essays which is a completely different affair. I can easily write a 3 page essay in about 1-2 hours and have never received under an A but that's completely different then fiction
