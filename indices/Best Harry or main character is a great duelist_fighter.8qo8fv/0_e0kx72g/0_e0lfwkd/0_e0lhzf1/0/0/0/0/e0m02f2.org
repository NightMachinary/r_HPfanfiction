Yes I have read Deprived (if you mean the WBWL story with Fleur during the tournament). Its mildly entertaining, but its pretty tropey and the author sort of admitted it had to many problems.

If you want more fics, I can PM the recs to you. Questions though: how many of the previous ones have you read (this vs that fic), have you read the major action fics (jbern, starfox5, Darth Marrs, etc.), and is there anything you don't want so I don't waste your time?
