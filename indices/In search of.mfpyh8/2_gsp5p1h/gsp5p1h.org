Most of the soul-bond stories are horrible (how to get him and her to a bed without bother of dating and in very improper age), the most famous one I cannot even name here for the Rule 8 (“Ginny, thirteen years old, had an orgasm.”), but there are few exceptions.

- “Meaning of One, Part One: Stone and Fire” by Sovran linksiye(11833) and its sequels; bad robot! forgot linking to SIYE again: [[https://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833]]
- “The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond” by Council linkffn(9818387) with absolutely awesome Dumbledore
- “Error of Soul” by Materia-Blade linkffn(8490518), which unfortunately ends exactly in the moment I would love it to continue, because it gets to really tough questions about pre-determined/arranged relationships and such. Pity.
