Well to respond to your first question I'm on the opinion that Order fighters from the first war were overall more skilled than the average death eaters. Hagrid depicted the Bones, the Prewetts and the McKinnons as some of the most powerful families in Britains, he might have spoken of them as politically powerful but I don't think so (at least not only that). That's why I consider Edgar Bones to be particularly powerful like his sister Amelia who "put a up a fight" against Voldemort himself. The same goes for the Prewetts brothers who were killed by several death eaters including Dolohov a particularly powerful dark wizard who bested Moody and Lupin in the second war.

The marauders for their part were extremely talented rookies when they joined the Orders, they weren't as experienced as the others like Moody, Frank Longbottom or Edgar Bones but I think that they learned really quickly as they had no others choices. In OOTP Lupin said to Molly that they used to be severely outnumbered (20 to 1) so the fact they managed to survived that long while openly defying Voldemort, and in spite of the numerous death eaters from their generations who would want to see them dead (Snape for example) is a testament to their skills.

There are about 3 years and a half between the moment Sirius left school and the moment he was was imprisoned. After escaping Azkaban Sirius barely used magic and the only time we saw him duelling was at the department of mystery where he defeated some death eater and fought evenly with Bellatrix the most skilled one until he laughed at her (a better performance than a highly rank auror). So the question is, when did he get that skilled ? Was he that good at the time he left Hogwarts or did he improve throughout those 3 years ? I think those are important question if you write fanficion portraying Sirius (and the others marauders) in that era.

About the deat eaters, I think you might add Evan Rosier among the skillful death eaters, he was killed in a tough duel against 'prime' Moody and managed to take his nose with him. Yaxley gave me a good impression too, I feel like he was some kind of a mix between Lucius and Bellatrix although not as politically important as Lucius used to be and not as skilled as Bellatrix (but still among the best).

PS: I didn't mean to imply that Order members could dozens of death eaters at once but some of them could defintely take several death eaters at once like Kingsley did during the second war. It would depend on which death eaters they were facing as obviously no one could take Bellatrix with another opponent, they'd be already be very good if they survived the dark witch.
