I think Canon is vague enough that you can do pretty much what you like as long as it's plausible in context. It's always about the execution. There's no harm in playing with some scenes to start with but what you really need to do is work out the framework of your plot. Know what character(s) you are going to focus on, what they want, what obstacles they face and how it all works out for them. (Just as you do for any story of course) But I really envy you doing this. The first war period has so much potential, you could do anything really. Exciting times!
