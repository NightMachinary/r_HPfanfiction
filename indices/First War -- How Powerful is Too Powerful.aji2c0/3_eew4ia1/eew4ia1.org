Honestly, spell selection is irrelevant. Vague lights are perfectly fine for action sequences. If you want to make the Order appear competent, they need to have victories while still losing the war. Think Germany in WWI. Won a lot of battles, was close to victory a few times, but was worn down over the years and was eventually overcome, with the overall defeat being very clear.

For example, the Order manages to capture a few Death Eaters each battle, until Voldemort breaks them out, so the DE are back at full strength while the order lost a bunch of members. Or give them Phyrric victories where they achieve their objectives but their losses are high.
