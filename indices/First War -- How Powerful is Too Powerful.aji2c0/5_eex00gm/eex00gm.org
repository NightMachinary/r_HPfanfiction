I think the Marauders are best utilized as guerrilla warfare type strategists. They understand movement, intention, and how to poke emotions out of their enemies. They create and execute schemes that give them insurmountable advantages; instrumental in ambushes, tracking charms on various objects that feed them magical signatures across London, listening devices all linked up on refuse bins that ping apparation points, creating and cracking ciphers, tracking unplottable places, impersonating Death Eaters to offer false information, capturing prisoners to interrogate them only to hand them back to their enemies to sew dissent in the ranks. Things like that.

With regards to actual combat, they are likely about as skilled as the average Auror or maybe a bit less so, but work better with a plan, and are good as a team. Aurors are good at small numbers, the Marauders excel when they ambush, trap, and blind their opponents, and are obviously skilled at creating magical artifacts to give them advantages.

I can see the Marauders being initially successful in the war, with their plans slowly eroding due to growing complexity and Wormtail's eventual betrayal, as well as Voldemort focusing on them more and more. I see the rest of the Marauders growing in skill and leaving Peter out of the important tasks as things progress, only for Peter to become jealous and chagrined at the lack of responsibility and respect.
