Being the Marauders, and therefore the guys who became Animagi in their teens and created the Marauder's Map, I would imagine they would be pretty creative in their dueling style --- though creative doesn't mean extraordinary /competent/; overconfidence/cockiness a well-documented character flaw for Sirius, James, and, for that matter, Snape, so you may want to have one of their more creative ideas backfire at one point.

The above, incidentally, should also apply to Peter whenever he actually works up the will to fight; but he should grow increasingly distraught and paranoid and selfish as the war goes on, his dueling becoming more and more jerky and unsteady until one day he mysteriously stops even aiming at the Death Eaters (which is blamed, not entirely inaccurately, on his fear of them), at which point he's retired to just guard duties on wherever the Headquarters were in the FIrst War.

Actually, as Lucius Malfoy is noted to have a collection of dark artifacts, I imagine him to prefer using such items to fighting with his wand, if he can avoid it. He will be the one throwing Peruvian Darkness Powder to blind his opponent, tossing Gemino-Cursed nails at them, etc.

As for other formidable Death Eaters... can't forget Barty Crouch Jr. (though he'd only be known in the First War as this mysterious, extremely skilled Death Eater of whom even the Order haven't the slightest inkling to the identity). We perceive Igor Karkaroff as a weakling due to the way he behaved around Voldemort, but can't have been that bad at magic if he got to be Headmaster of Durmstrang; and he had to be pretty high in favor with the Dark Lord to have all those names to name at the Trial.

Evan Rosier got a hit on Mad-Eye Moody (with a dark and powerful enough spell to leave a scar that magic can't fix) before Moody took him down, so he can't have been bad at dueling either.

...

Anyway, another bit of advice: use Aurors. The Order was instrumental in the War, yes, but Barty Crouch Sr.'s Aurors were very big players, and likely took down more Death Eaters than the Order did.
