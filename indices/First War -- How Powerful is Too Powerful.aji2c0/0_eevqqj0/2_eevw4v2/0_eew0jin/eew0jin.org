That's fair. I intend this to be from Sirius's POV, so he was probably overstated in my posting. But I am curious about other members given that, unless ambushed, I think both sides generally fight with more than one at a time.

Interesting that you think Moody > McGonagall. She does seem to hold her own. Experience? Or what makes you think that?

There's also the Order member, can't recall her name now (was it Dorcas?) killed by Voldemort individually. Easy to paint her as a force to be reckoned with and hence the personal visit.
