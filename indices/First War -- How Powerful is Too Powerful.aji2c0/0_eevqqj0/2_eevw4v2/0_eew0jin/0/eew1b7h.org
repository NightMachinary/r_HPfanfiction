Personally because Moody, by rights of profession, should be a lot more experienced and well rounded. He is as old as her but dedicated his time to training and fighting, while she went on to take her mastery on Transfiguration, study and teach.

While I don't doubt her magical capacity, I don't think she is in the same level as Moody when it comes to fighting. Plus, Moody is a lot more well versed in dark magic and is surely a lot more brutal.
