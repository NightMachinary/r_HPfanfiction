As for notable Death Eaters, I think that Dolohov is supposed to have been one of the top Death Eaters and Rookwood was an Unspeakable, which is no small feat.

On the Auror's side, don't forged Rufus Scrimgeour. He is supposed to be a pretty impressive Auror and a hardass at that, so he would probably be in the thick of it and one of the guys not giving a shit about using more deadly spells against the Death Eaters.

On the order side I would say that it should go Albus > Moody > McGonnagal and then other members. It is sad that we don't know a lot about First War members, but Gideon and Fabian Prewett must have been impressive if the DE went out of their way to ambush them.

Honestly, I feel like people overstate the Marauders a lot at least in the first war. I mean, I am not saying they weren't talented, but they were mostly fresh out of Hogwarts in most of the war. I am sure they all had their area of expertise that contributed to the Order, but I don't think they were out there taking 5 DE at once, each.

Academical ability doesn't necessarily translate into war potention or combat ability.
