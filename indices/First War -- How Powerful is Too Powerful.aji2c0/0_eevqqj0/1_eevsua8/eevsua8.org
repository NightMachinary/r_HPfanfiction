This is very interesting/helpful, thank you.

I have a similar read on Peter. I think he must have been fast on his feet and rather more powerful than he was given credit for, given that one spell of his /cracked a street/ down to the pipe. That was some fast thinking, too. But I see him as hesitatant when scared and those moments might be costly. Then, as he integrates into the Death Eaters, he finds it difficult to play both sides in battle (unlike a more accomplished wizard like Snape), so he increasingly leans on appearing incompetent, even if it's only an act.

Would you buy wandless magic, if say, someone were disarmed? Or is that too God Tier to be believable? (I might for the one off spell, but certainly not a whole battle fought in this way.)

Or the invention of spells? Meaning not the use of a spell that isn't specifically referenced in canon (which is... limiting), but rather the suggestion that someone in the Order actually invented a spell for X and Y reason. We know Snape invented spells. I do wonder if the Marauders Map was created with new magic, or just the creative use of existing spells...
