Fair point. Pottermore is a weird one because it's pick-and-choose canon. I personally treat the skills as "suggestions" if it fits in with my own beliefs. So for the examples I mentioned, I do imagine that James and Sirius were accomplished in most subjects, given they were top students, but might fallback on their favored areas in a fight or be more confident/creative in that one discipline. (I also like the idea that James led the charge with the animagus transformation and Sirius the map.)

But the same section lists Lupin for Defense Against the Dark Arts, which isn't really telling of much. Was he? Or was that just the post available? What does that even mean, since defense work is sort of a subset of charms in the end...

And it doesn't even list a skill for Peter. ouch.
