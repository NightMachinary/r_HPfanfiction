I mean, I was writing something EXACTLY like this about an oc, but I haven't updated since, like, last June or something. It's "Heir of Slytherpuff" on Wattpad if you wanna go read the prologue and the first two and a half chapters, I think its written well, but noooowhere near finished. Maybe you can encourage me to write some more if you like the premise or something.
