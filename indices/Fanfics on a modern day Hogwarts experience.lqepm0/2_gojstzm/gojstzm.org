There's arguably a fair bit of that in linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay). Investigating why (some) electronics don't work at Hogwarts. Introducing popular muggle culture (especially novels). Starting a magical space program.

Annals of Arithmancy also has elements of that, but is really just the capstone to a trilogy; you need to have read the previous (very long) books to really get it.
