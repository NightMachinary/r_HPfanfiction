I mean, I dislike some canon pairings (Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione come to mind) it just doesn't make sense to me, like, how is it that Harry (who hates fangirls) suddenly starts liking Ginny, who is still awkward even when the relationship starts, and how the hell does Ron get the smart girl, like before OotP I was completely rooting for Harmony, but then Hinny came along somehow, idk
