I'm really enjoying the story so far. I'm on chapter 97. This is probably the most natural Snily story I ever read. The progression is well-paced, and it's not unrealistic. There's no unrealistic character bashing (there was this one Snily fic I read that made James turn into this purely evil, narcissistic, bullying rapist who had an extremely unhealthy obsession with Lily; James isn't so terrible when you think about it!). I also like how they're taking things slowly instead of going right for it (unlike in the other fics I read). Thank you so much for recommending it to me!
