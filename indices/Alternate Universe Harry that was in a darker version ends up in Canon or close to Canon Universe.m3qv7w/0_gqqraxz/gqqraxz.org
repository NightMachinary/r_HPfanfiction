There was an interesting fic I read a very long time ago where Harry was kidnapped by petigrew instead of betraying the potters location to Voldemort. He brought him Harry and Voldemort ends up raising him as a son. He takes on this sort of enforcer role in the death eaters where if they betray them, the “dark prince” comes and kills them. It was a great story. There were two sequels and I remember one of them being him swapping places with canon Harry. The story would switch back and forth between the perspectives. I'll see if I can find it if you're interested.
