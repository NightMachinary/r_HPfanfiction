Personally I prefer to read slashfics. They are not only porn as many (main-)het-readers seem to think but most of the ones I read don't focus on the lgbt aspect (Harry simply is bi/gay and it's no big thing in those fics) but I think if you ask in [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] you might find a few ppl who can help you to find more serious fics.
