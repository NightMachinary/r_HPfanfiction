On the one hand, the problem with that lies in the singular power of an individual wizard or witch makes the idea of blood rule somewhat moot (it helps Voldemort to claim Slytherin decent, but in the end it matters more that he is the /strongest/ and champions the cause they support). On the other, the kind of violence in ASOIAF necessitates a lot of people, and there really just aren't that many in the Wizarding World. A few good examples though:

linkffn(Incorruptible: A Dementor's Stigma): a zombie AU, heavily focused on back-dealing and politicking in a fairly believable manner.

linkffn(The Firebird's Son) and its sequels have quite a bit of family maneurvering and political machination, and brutality that honestly gives ASOIAF a run for its money (seriously, this can be dark).
