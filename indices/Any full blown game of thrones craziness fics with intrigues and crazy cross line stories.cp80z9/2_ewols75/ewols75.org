Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) has like 4-6 different factions, some allied and some not, with complicated politics between.

Voldemort is back, but doesn't do any attacks yet as long as Fudge does appeasement.

Death Eaters in the Ministry try to sabotage it once the Ministry starts moving against Voldemort.

Dumbledore's Order has to stay deniable and he can't have any ties to Hermione's group going public or he'd lose all influence in the Ministry.

Hermione's group is secretly supported by Dumbledore and Sirius, but they're hunted by both the Ministry and Voldemort, although they only attack Death Eaters they're more feared than Voldemort amongst the purebloods.

The French help the Order, but they're limited in what they can do without risking political complications between France and Britain.

The Avengers are a rather complicated and spoilery story.

Then there's the Jamaicans...
