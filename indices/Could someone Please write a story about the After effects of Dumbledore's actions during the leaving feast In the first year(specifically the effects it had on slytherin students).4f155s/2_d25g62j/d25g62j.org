I feel like no one is giving this thought. OP, it is unlikely anyone is going to specially write that. Snape comforting people isn't going to happen in canon. For others, Snape and Slytherin being bad doesn't make Harry's view or Dumbledore automatically in the right.

Here is the book quotes.

#+begin_quote
  ‘Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs awarding and the points stand thus: in fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw have four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.' A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight. ‘Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,' said Dumbledore. ‘However, recent events must be taken into account.' The room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little.

Awards 50 points. Cheering. Waits for silence. Awards 50 points. Cheering. Waits for silence. Awards 60 points. Cheering. Waits for silence. Even on points. Awards 10 points. Explosive cheering.

  [Harry] pointed at Malfoy, who couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the Body-Bind curse put on him. ‘Which means,' Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, ‘we need a little change of decoration.' He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place.

Harry calls Draco celebrating a sickening sight. So things might be coloured by his viewpoint somewhat. Snape is unfair, however that doesn't mean all points Slytherin gained were unfair nor the other Houses screwed over. And Gryffindor were down 160 points, or at least 40 from Hufflepuff and 110 from Ravenclaw. Do Gryffindor deserve a hell of a lot of points for Harry's actions- of course(#).

Regardless, we know that Dumbledore visited Harry in the hospital as did Ron and Hermione. In all other instances we saw the points were awarded immediately. Dumbledore could have awarded them personally, individually or together, or conferred with the other professors under the circumstances and come to a consensus together.

I don't have a horse in this race, but at its kindest what Dumbledore was for the dramatic. If being unkind drama is used to play on the emotions of people and that means to give some the thrill of victory others must be made to suffer. It may only be in the form of disappointment, but we have to believe there are some humans (people capable of good and bad), some kids, who were gut wrenched, or, as is the case, stunned and horrified.

My opinion would be that when taken in the spirit of the novel it is a fitting end. When objectively viewed as just another school it is a harsh thing to let one House go into the feast with high spirits and revel in their victory only to award it to another.

As far as what you're looking for OP- that requires a particular fan skewed perception. Those who do feel as you do are probably more likely to write it so that Slytherin win. Otherwise I don't know of any, but good luck, some might be out there. I just wouldn't expect someone here to write it for you. If you're looking for a discussion of how actual kids would feel then all I can suggest is contrasting extremes of distress don't help (even if that's what got you thinking about it).

(#)Then again as it was entirely outside the curriculum and technically they broke curfew, and technically Harry didn't save the stone (as it would have remained in the mirror and Dumbledore return); so I don't think it would have been unfair to award Neville points and give the others an award- there is a trophy room- instead of points.
