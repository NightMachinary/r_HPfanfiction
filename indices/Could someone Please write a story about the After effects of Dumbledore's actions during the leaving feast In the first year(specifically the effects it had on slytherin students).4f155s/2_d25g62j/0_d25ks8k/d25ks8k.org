I think that makes sense. I think in the books, it mentions that Slytherins had been winning for a long time now (or was that the quidditch cup?), so I didn't feel much sympathy for them. I think it showed Slytherin being horrified to further depict them as the "evil" house by being sore losers. What Dumbledore did was overly dramatic, but maybe he did it because Gryffindor was so low in points others would have wondered where all of those points came from. So if he had to make an announcement about where the points came from, he might as well as just award them right there. But that's a lot of speculation, I can't say for sure that JK thought that hard about it.
