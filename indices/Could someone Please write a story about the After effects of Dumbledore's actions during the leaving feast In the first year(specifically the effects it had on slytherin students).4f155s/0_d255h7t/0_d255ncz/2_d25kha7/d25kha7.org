This is the movie, the movies changed a lot of stuff so I was referring to the books. Also, he says exactly what I thought he did. He never took the cup away from them, he simply stated where everyone was in the point system and said that a few more points were needed, which put Gryffindor in first place. I think the students understand perfectly well, it's not that hard to comprehend. Plus, everyone already knew what happened with Quirrel and what Harry and the others did. That's why Harry woke up with a ton of gifts in the hospital wing. I think the movies and the books showed Slytherin being all grumpy about it because it depicted the "evil" house as being sore losers (not a fair depiction, but still).

When I was in school, we had a similar system. My school was one class per grade and everyone worked hard each year to collect the most canned soup or whatever that we would donate to a soup kitchen, and in exchange receive an awesome pizza/ice cream party and a fancy blue ribbon. Nobody cared when someone showed up to school with a huge truckload of cans from some sale four hours away because finding the cans and being competitive was the fun part. Sure, the party was fun, but if we lost because someone's uncle that worked in a restaurant decided to pitch in, we didn't care. And this was a school with kindergarten to 8th grade, so we were pretty young. I think it's actually a good lesson. Sometimes you lose, and that loss can be pretty unexpected. Doesn't mean you didn't try or that you suck, just that someone else managed to come through that time. It's not traumatic. It's life.
