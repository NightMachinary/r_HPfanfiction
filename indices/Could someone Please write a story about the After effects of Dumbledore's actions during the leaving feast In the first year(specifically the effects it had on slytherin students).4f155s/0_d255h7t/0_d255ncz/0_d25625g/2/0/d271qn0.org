Do we actually KNOW (without looking at FANON!) that Snape comforts his students and actually helps them? (With the exception of Draco - where there's a VOW in play when he offers to help etc.) I mean if he helps them like he "teaches" (quotes because what he does isn't IMHO teaching, it's being an asshole at best and endangering his students at worst!) potions, then I wouldn't want to be in his house!

As for Flitwick: If Luna doesn't tell him, then how would he know? (It seems that the heads of house seldom enter the common-rooms and the dormitories even less!) They are not hurting her physically after all, they are "just" (I know that it's not ok - I've been bullied at school myself for 4 long years...it started with my stuff vanishing (and like say having my bag thrown into the girl's bathroom!) and ended with my homework being destroyed and people hitting me during recess and shooting spitballs at me in class (note: My teachers were worse than the Hogwarts ones: They ignored evindence directly in front of them...I am still a little pissed because my parents didn't take them all to court (I would have!)) taking her stuff (and she's an oddball after all, the teachers know that, so maybe they think she missplaces things herself?)

As for McGonagall: She's not a good head of house and "keep your head down" is shitty advice (particularly if you are a supposedly brave person!), as is ignoring students time and time again (the bullying with the badges, the heir of Slytherin thing, the sorcerers stone - I mean is it any wounder that Harry never goes and asks for her advice? Is it any wounder that he rather does things himself - I mean all the adults in his life (with the exception of his parents!) fail at doing their duties (he's neglected at Privet Drive (at best - abused at worst!), he's bullied in school, he has to fight Voldemort (which should be the aurors and the professors business, not that of a student!) etc. etc. - frankly it's a wounder he didn't snap!) - instead of asking for help (even if the outcome of doing so isn't always great, like when Sirius dies!)?)

I agree that we don't know enough about Sprout!
