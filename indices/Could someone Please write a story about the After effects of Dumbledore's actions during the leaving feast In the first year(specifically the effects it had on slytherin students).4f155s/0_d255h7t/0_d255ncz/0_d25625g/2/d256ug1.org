One thing to note is that of the heads of house when it comes to Snape to me he is in the top 2 when it comes to looking after his students the only reason I don't put him at number one is that we don't know enough about professor Sprout to be able to rate her.

Professor McGonagall comes in third manly because of the conflict of interest she has being the deputy headmistress.

The title of worst head of house goes to professor Flitwick because there is no excuse that he could give that would make what happen to Luna acceptable.
