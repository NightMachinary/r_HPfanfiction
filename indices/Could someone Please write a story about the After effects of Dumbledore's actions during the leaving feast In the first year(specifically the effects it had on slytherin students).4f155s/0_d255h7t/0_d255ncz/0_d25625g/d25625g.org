I'm not sure if you ever played much sport as a kid, but if you've ever been robbed of a seemingly deserved victory in something like a grand final, championship series or just a competition you should be able to relate.

Does it suck? Yes. It it a shitty feeling, to work for something and feel like it's in the bag, only to have it snatched away? Also yes. But if you think a bunch of 11 to 18 year olds aren't able to deal with something like that without resorting to potions, then either you are severely mistaken or they are some very emotionally unstable teenagers.

That's not to say they wouldn't be a bit bitter about it, or that it didn't further fuel the Gryffindor/Slytherin feud, but I think you are overestimating the effects quite a lot. And besides, they would still be bitter over it whether it happened a day or a minute before the award.
