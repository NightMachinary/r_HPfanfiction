Your confusion is self-inflicted because Cal wasn't "combining" anything. The reference to fanfiction was in the original post and clearly marked as a memory of a fanfiction which inspired the original question. Canon didn't come up until Cal was later asked what Dumbledore actually said.

So really, it's not Cal's fault.
