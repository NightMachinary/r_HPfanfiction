  the original line from the story Snape full thought was along the line of that he was up half the night trying to assure 11-18 that no they are not evil

I don't get it. Are you trying to say that you remember the book saying this? because the book didn't explore Snape's thoughts. If it's just how you imagine his thoughts would be, I think it's both very OoC and a very strange interpretation of the events. Dumbledore certainly didn't imply that Slytherins were evil, and there was certainly no punishment there. Well, it's possible that he was trying to "punish" Snape for being unfair, which, in my opinion, is justified. I certainly didn't see any Slytherins protesting Snape's unfair treatment of Gryffindors.
