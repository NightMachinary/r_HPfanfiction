I don't remember how the exact scene happened in canon, and I didn't even watch the clip you've provided. However, I should tell you that the movies aren't regarded as canon by most of the serious fans, so instead of providing a clip from the movie, you should provide a quote from the book.

Personally, I think that if some kid gets nightmares from this kind of thing, he's a little pussy who doesn't have a place in Slytherin.
