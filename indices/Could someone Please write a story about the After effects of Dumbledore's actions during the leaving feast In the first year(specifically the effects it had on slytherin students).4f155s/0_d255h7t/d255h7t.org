It kind of seems like you're over estimating the effect this has on the kids. Why would the kids need calming or sleeping potions? I can understand them being pissed off, but that seems a bit much.

Also, did Dumbledore say, "Slytherin has House Cup!" and then add, "But wait, here are some more points!" after they cheered? Or did he say, "Slytherin has the most points," and Slytherin interrupted him with cheering, "but there are some last-minute points to award."
