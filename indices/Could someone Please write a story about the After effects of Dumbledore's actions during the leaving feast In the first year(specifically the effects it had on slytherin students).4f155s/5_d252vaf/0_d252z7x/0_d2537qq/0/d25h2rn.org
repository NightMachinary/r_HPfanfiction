Dumbledore really didn't explain anything- best chess game, cool logic, courage, bravery. So as far as the school at large is concerned, they still don't really know why the points are awarded.

That being said Percy talks about Ron beating McGonagalls chess set like it was common knowledge. Meaning that perhaps tales of Harry Potter in the hospital wing got out in the school rumour mill. Of course we assume the whole tale wasn't told to the school. That makes sense- no one thought Voldemort was there. But that begs the question- if nothing was told then why would Percy not only understand but be proud that is brother beat a professors work? ie. Hurray for disobeying school rules and endangering his person, breaking curfew, and purposefully trying to get by protections put up by professors in the forbidden corridor. Doesn't sound like Percy.

In summation- clearly some knowledge was out, enough to give context that the curfew breaking trio did something great. Dumbledore's speech didn't explain further. Meaning, as is the case for all other points awarded, it probably made more sense to award the points to their face when he saw them prior. Which, in my opinion, beats leading the Houses on, and he could still say a few short words at the feast already having given the points. Just my two cents.
