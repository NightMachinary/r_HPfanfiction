Excerpt from linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk), Chapter 4, from Slytherin!Hermione's point of view:

#+begin_quote
  Her good mood was buoyed even further when she entered the Great Hall. She was pleased to see that Harry, Ron, and Neville were all present and in good health, but she was especially happy about the green and silver banners decorating the hall. She had always taken pride in her performance at school, but earning good grades was an inherently solitary activity. Helping Slytherin win the House Cup was a victory that was all the sweeter for being shared.

  On a more practical level, no matter how much her housemates disliked her, she knew they at least appreciated the points she won for Slytherin. And all of the dislike was momentarily set aside as Dumbledore read out the score: Gryffindor with 341 points, Hufflepuff with 347, Ravenclaw with 411, and Slytherin in the lead with 492.

  The cheers at the Slytherin table were momentarily silenced when Dumbledore announced that some final points remained to be awarded. Hermione felt her stomach start to sink as he awarded Neville fifty points for “a tremendous example of recall under pressure” and fifty points to Ron for “the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen these many years.” Dumbledore cleared his throat, and for a moment she dared to hope that he was finished.

  “To Mr. Harry Potter, for pure love and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty points,” Dumbledore said, dashing her hopes. “Assuming that my calculations are correct I believe that a change in decoration is in order!”

  Gryffindor's table burst into cheers as the banners throughout the Great Hall changed from green and silver to crimson and gold. All around Hermione, Slytherin house sat in stunned silence as they tried to process what had just transpired.

  Hermione stared at the head table in disbelief, wondering if Snape would do something to fix this situation. Her head of house did nothing more than grimace slightly in distaste at the headmaster's actions, and the truth sank in: there would be no eleventh hour rescues for Slytherin house.

  She mechanically finished eating the food already on her plate, but the always wonderful food of Hogwarts was ashes on her tongue.

  ooOoo

  Hermione stalked down the corridor of the Hogwarts Express. The three days following the end of year feast had done little to change her disposition, as she-along with most of Slytherin house-had spent that time stewing over how the rug had been pulled out from under them. It hadn't helped that Neville had spent that time successfully avoiding her attempts to pin him down for a conversation. Here on the train, though, there was no Gryffindor-only room to which he could retreat.

  She smiled when she finally located the compartment containing Harry, Ron and Neville. She opened the door and greeted the three of them, but the only response she received were a round of wary stares. Neville started to slowly edge away from her.

  “Thirty two,” Hermione said. Seeing the blank looks on the boys' faces, she continued. “I keep track, you know. Every time I earn points. Add it all up, and on net I earned Slytherin thirty-two points all year.”

  She sat down across from the boys, fixing them with a glare. “What I want to know is what you lot did to earn fifty points in one night. Fifty points each!”

  The cabin remained silent as the three Gryffindors turned to look at each other, apparently weighing their options. Somewhat to her surprise, it was Ron who replied to her question.

  “What we did,” Ron said, “was stop Quirrel from stealing the Philosopher's Stone and using it to bring Voldemort back to life!”

  Hermione stared at Ron for a moment.

  “That makes no sense on so many levels,” Hermione finally said, “that I have no idea where to begin.”

  There was no hesitation now as Ron heatedly recounted the events of the last day of exams. How the three of them had ventured down the forbidden third floor corridor, using music to tame the three-headed dog. How they fell into an enormous Devil's Snare, saved only by Neville's quick recognition of the plant. How Harry's skill on a broom had allowed him to retrieve a flying key. Ron's ability to play his way across a life size game of wizarding chess and finally, Harry casting the strongest shield charm he could manage and charging through flames to confront the shade of the man who had killed his parents.

  It was a hard tale to believe, but as Ron spoke Hermione saw both Harry and Neville nodding along. Neither of them seemed to be surprised by any of the things Ron was saying, and it was hard to imagine that they would coordinate some elaborate deception just to toy with her.

  “That doesn't make sense,” Hermione said, trying to think through the implications, “you interfered with Dumbledore's plans and he rewarded you for it.”

  “Interfered?” Ron asked, affronted. “Quirrel got through all of his defenses and would have gotten the stone if we hadn't showed up.”

  “Those weren't defenses!” Hermione exclaimed. “Look, if you lock a door and you don't want somebody going through, where do you keep the key?”

  The three boys stared at her for a moment before Neville spoke up. “In my pocket?”

  “Exactly!” Hermione said. “You don't leave it in the same room with the locked door, no matter how many enchantments you put on it.”

  “What are you trying to say?” Ron asked.

  “I'm trying to say that you didn't get past defenses-you got past challenges that Dumbledore wanted people to get past,” Hermione replied. “I'm saying that you didn't do anything that was worth one hundred and sixty points-“

  “Will you lay off about the bloody points already?” Harry interrupted, surprisingly vehement. “Quirrel really did try to kill me. When I grabbed him his arm started burning...”

  Harry's voice trailed away as he was obviously lost in memory. Hermione remained silent, slightly ashamed that he thought she had been making light of the danger he had faced.

  “Look, I don't know why Dumbledore awarded us points. I don't know why he does half the things he does,” Harry said. “All I know is that we tried to do the right thing, and we nearly died doing it. If you have a problem with the House Cup, you should be complaining to Dumbledore, not us.”

  The compartment fell silent after that, and Hermione left without saying another word. She felt bad for upsetting Harry like that, but she couldn't help feeling a little irritation herself that none of the Gryffindors seemed to understand how unfairly her house had been treated.
