The entire Stygian and Anguis series are completed (though there's a sort of sequel to Stygian that isn't completed but Stygian wraps everything up so you don't have to read that one) and are over 300k+ words. Shade to Shade is the sequel to Latet and Starfall to Ignite. Technically speaking Anguis is a prequel to Stygian but you honestly don't have to read it.
