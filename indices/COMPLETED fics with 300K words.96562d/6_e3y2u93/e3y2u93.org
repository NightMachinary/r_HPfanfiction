Linkffn(the blood of your veins by Arinus)

This is the middle book of my my mentor!Snape/parent!Snape fic and it is the longest at 856k words. It covers an OC's 7 years at Hogwarts which overlaps with Harry's. There's also a 97k word prequel and a WIP sequel that is 166k so far (the first two stories, including the very long one, are done).
