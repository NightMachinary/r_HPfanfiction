I've read both Arithmancer and it's sequel. The first one was good because it was outlined, and Hermione's special ability doesn't overpower the rest of the story. The second one spends too much time trying to be clever, with some plot lines like Rita Skeeter just loosely tied up at the end. Hermione ends up on center stage in the sequel, and never really leaves it.
