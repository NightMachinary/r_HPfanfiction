I have read this fic a few times and really enjoy it, it is Snape/Harry so if you aren't into that you may not like it, but still worth a look [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4608235/1/It-All-Started-With-A-Visit-To-Gringotts]]

No real pairing with this one, again it's one I've re-read and really enjoy [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7161848/1/893]]

More than happy to recommend some others if you don't mind the occasional slash pairing or no pairing, also a few really good Draco/Ginny/Blaise if you're into that and also Lily/Scorpius
