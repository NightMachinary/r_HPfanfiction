The fics are updated at a regular intervals, and some of them are split into different ones, like Pos or DP&SW, Harry Potter and the Game.

The only uncompleted fics are: Dodging prison and Stealing witches (Book 2 out of 8)

Prince of Slytherin(Book 3 out of 7 or 8)

Harry Potter and the Game (Book 3 out of 5)

The second sequel of Harry Potter and the gift of memories

A third path to the future

Revolution, last sequel of Resonance, but it is practically complete.

The fourth part of Last Mage of Krypton.

You will see that most of the fics are complete, and it is only the sequels which are not.

More fics to add:
