I don't think you understand what the word 'completed' means. A work in progress is by it's very definition not completed. It's also pretty disingenuous to call a work complete as long as one part of a series is complete but the rest are well away from being completed. Especially when those parts that are finished doesn't have contained endings or anywhere close to a decent resolution. You yourself listed 7 of them as not completed and there's at least 2 that you missed. That's about half of the total works you listed in your initial post.

The OP specifically asked for completed works, so if you're going to recommend something that's not actually complete or a series of works where only parts of it is complete you should most definitely note that next to the recommendations. Kind of like you did in your second list here, so good on you for that.

I would be beyond pissed if I asked for a recommendation of completed works, saw one of your definitely not completed recommendations and ended up reading 300k words just to get to the end and see that it's in the middle of part 3 of a 5 part series. Personally I always doublecheck fanfics these days to see if it's been abandoned or if there's a sequel somewhere that's also abandoned/not finished, but I'm sure there's people that don't do that and would just start reading from chapter 1 without checking.

Still thanks for all the suggestions, quite a few of them I haven't read or looked at yet, so much appreciated.
