To be Mary Sue (or more specifically, Marty Stu) would indicate that he's good at everything - or rather, the best at everything - in a way that doesn't have any good explanation except that the author wanted it that way. I don't think that applies to this Harry.

He has trouble controlling his temper, which semi-alienates Neville for a while. He's condescending to people he considers not worth his time, like Ron, and that's upsetting to Hermione, whom he actually likes. His head for strategy gives him an edge in the mock battles, but he's still beaten by Hermione because he didn't think to delegate responsibility and get other people's ideas like she did, and beaten by Draco because Draco's soldiers were smart enough to copy Harry's own protective gear.

When he is legitimately extraordinary at something, it's usually from either applying his background in logical and scientific thinking to magical problems, which apparently hasn't happened before in recent times due to the small numbers of muggle born wizards, or else because of the changes to his brain from encountering Voldemort.
