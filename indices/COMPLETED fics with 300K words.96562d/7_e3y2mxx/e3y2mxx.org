Most people either love or hate linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality).

Personally, I found it to be smart, funny, complex, almost typo-free, and thought-provoking. On the other hand, lots of people find Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres to be an arrogant jerk, which is sometimes true (especially the first few chapters), and sometimes not (he is very loyal to those he considers friends), and sometimes it gets him smacked down hard (like his interactions with Professor Snape). If you like long fics, I suggest reading and deciding for yourself.

Note that there's an alternate beginning (longer and with a better depiction of Harry's relationship with his parents) by [[/u/daystareld]] at [[http://daystareld.com/hpmor-remix-1]]
