I can thoroughly recommend the Albus Potter series, starting with linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation). It's a full 7-book series with a couple of sequels, one-shots etc added on. Because it's very well planned-out (they had a 100-page synopsis of everything that was gonna happen) there's plenty of foreshadowing, callbacks, etc. etc.
