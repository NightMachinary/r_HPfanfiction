If Albus Severus is old enough to grow a beard, then his parents shouldn't care about that. I get that it was just an idea, but in story it doesn't make much sense...

I like the Fred Jr one, that sounds like a good idea, though by resemble I assume you meant his behavior rather than his actual looks.

I always did wonder what would happen if Victoire, Louis and Dominique went to Bexauxbaton instead.
