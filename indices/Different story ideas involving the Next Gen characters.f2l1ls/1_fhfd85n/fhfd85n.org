Hugo is a squib. He ends up becoming extremely close to his muggle grandparents. How everyone else reactions is up to you.

Dominque takes up an extremely unladylike sport (skateboarding, boxing, death defying stunts etc, anything but Quidditch), horrifying her mother Fleur.

Despite nheriting his mother's clumsiness and his father's lack of luck, Teddy Lupin's somehow managed to fool everyone into thinking he's a competent (though insane) auror even though he's. When the department comes under investigation, will he be able to keep up the act?
