I thought a Hex was a short term negative effect, a Jinx was a long term negative effect, and a Curse was an instant or permanent negative effect.

With a Charm being a short term positive effect, an enchantment being a long term positive effect, and a Spell being an instant or permanent positive effect. “Spell” also being used as a common nomenclature for any given magic, if the specific type is not known, or given.

But maybe that's just headcanon...
