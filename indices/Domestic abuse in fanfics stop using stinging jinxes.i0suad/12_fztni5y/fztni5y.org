Seriously guys it's just unethical to use a stinging jinx anywhere in your fic if it does not pertain to kink. If so stop kink shaming the kink fics using stinging jinxes in a playful manner ALSO think of adding your own non-canon, less painful jinxes of your own into fics, for example use psychological horror elements to make a non painful attack mentally painful. My favorite is the knee reversal hex concept where your knees aren't in any pain but you are unable to move immediately after and it breaks someone's will to live a little bit.

MUCH better than a welt overall.
