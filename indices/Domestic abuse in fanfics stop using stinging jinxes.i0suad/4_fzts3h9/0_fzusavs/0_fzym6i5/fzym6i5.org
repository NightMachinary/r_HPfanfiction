You literally can though. Two examples: the Patronus and Expelliarmis. If your Patronus is weak, it will come out as a mist, a little stronger and it'll become a white shield, and the strongest form is a solid white animal being summoned amd protecting you. With Expelliarmis, we see it go from simply knocking the wand out of someone's hand to throwing the person against a wall hard enough to knock them out. There is definitely some amount of power variation within spells. How you want to extrapolate that is up to you, but the evidence is there.
