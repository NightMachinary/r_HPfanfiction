The problem at its most basic seems to be that JKR "invented" two spells and called them basically the same thing.

The first, from /Order of the Phoenix/ is a minor offensive spell that causes mild pain, localized swelling, and reddening of the skin.

The second is a much more aggressive spell that should probably be more rightly named the Anaphylaxis Jinx or Swelling Jinx. The debilitating pain would be caused by the rapid, massive swelling in the target area.

I imagine that there are some relationships wherein the /OOTP/ spell wouldn't be taboo but it's not for me.

Someone who used the second spell against me should expect both a termination of our relationship and reciprocation of some sort that may or may not include burning their home down.

  "He saw Hermione point her wand...into his face; there was a bang, a burst of white light, and he buckled in agony, unable to see. He could feel his face swelling rapidly under is hands...."

  "Harry clutched at his excruciatingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable underneath his fingers, tight, swollen, and puffy as though he had suffered some violent allergic reaction. His eyes had been reduced to slits through which he could barely see...."

  "Through his puffy eyelids, Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy scrutinizing his swollen face."

  "His face was huge, shiny, and pink, every feature distorted by Hermione's jinx."

  "Looks like a Stinging Jinx to me."
