I'd like to point out that the "reality" of the jinx is irrelevant. In the books, it might be a serious jinx/hex.

But in most fanfictions, it's use and, most importantly, it's /results/ are the equivalent of a playful slap.

It may cause painful and disfiguring swelling, /in canon/, but it /doesn't/ in those fanfictions.

Just like wards with, magic in fanfiction doesn't have to work the same way as it does in canon.
