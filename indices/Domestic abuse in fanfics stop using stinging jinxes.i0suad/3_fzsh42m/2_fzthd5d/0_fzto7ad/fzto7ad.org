I'm reposting my reply to the parent comment because I'd like you to see it. It might change your mind, or at least give you a bit of perspective on these situations.

Getting kicked in the balls was a pretty regular part of going to public school. Getting towel whipped could hurt pretty bad too lol.

One key thing to all of this is that fanon stingy hexes/jinxes seem to be quite different than the canon stinging jinx, at least in the stories that I've read. @OP seems to be missing that. It seems to be more of a light slap/pinch rather than the very painful sting with lots of swelling in canon. Technically both can work simultaneously- just look at Expelliarmis. Depending on how much power you put behind it, it can simply knock a wand out of someone's hand or it can slam someone into a wall with enough force to knock them out. That could easily work with the stinging jinx.

Also, in regards to friends or partners hurting each other, it really depends on the people and the relationship between them. If you're writing a Harry that's suffering from some kind of PTSD from an abusive childhood, then obviously he wouldn't be okay with someone who reacts violently/hurts him, especially over small things (even if it is something like a pinch or a light slap). But I'll use myself as an example of the opposite. I had a friend in high school, and we did a lot of stupid shit. We once had a competition to see who could last longer having their hand burned by a magnifying glass in the Sun. Another time we waterboarded each other, and once I lost a bet and had to let him slap me as hard as he could across the face (it fuckin' hurt). I also paid him five bucks to put his dick in marinara sauce, which apparently hurts a lot. Point being, casual pain between friends is fairly normal so long as everyone involved is cool with it. I won't even get into the fact that BDSM is a thing between partners since this post isn't really about sexual violence, but it's a good example of consensual pain between partners.

All that being said, as stated in a comment above, the wizarding world's culture is quite different than our own, especially in terms of injury and harm. While I definitely don't agree with child abuse being okay under any circumstances (eg Neville being dropped out a window and Molly hitting Fred with a broom when he was a kid), friends doing stupid shit to each other is different. In Hogwarts kids get into fights and cast jinxes, hexes, and curses at each other often enough. While these aren't the same as friends messing around and are treated like actual fights, it's never considered a big deal because, quite frankly, it's not. The spells they use are generally pretty minor compared to what we see Death Eaters use, or plenty of fanon combat spells. The stinging jinx as portrayed in fanfics is less severe than pretty much anything we see in the school fights in canon, so I don't think anyone would treat it as a big deal at all.
