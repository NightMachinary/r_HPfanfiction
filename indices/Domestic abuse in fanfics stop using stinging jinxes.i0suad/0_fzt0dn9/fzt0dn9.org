I think the first point is that most fics do not use stinging hexes like in canon. In canon, it's like a bad reaction to a bee sting that disfigures and causes significant pain. In many fics, it ends up being merely a welt, if that. I've read many stories where it's little more than a temporary red mark.

I think it depends a lot on the particular relationship. If someone does not like it, or the hexing occurs in anger, I see the abuse. But if the friends or couples express their playfulness through the equivalent of playful slaps, I see no reason for it. So long as it occurs consensually (tacit is fine in these instances, in my opinion, due to the lack of severity in most fics), I see no reason to consider it abuse.
