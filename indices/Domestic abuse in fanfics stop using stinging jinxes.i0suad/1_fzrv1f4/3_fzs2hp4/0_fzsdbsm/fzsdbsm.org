The issue is, while some laws draw the line when it comes to leaving a mark, does that mean that /the Wizarding World's/ laws do? Healing means that injuries get dealt with faster. It might even be argued that, since it's something so easily fixable by a witch or wizard with a healing spell, it "doesn't" leave a mark.

The abilities are /different/. The technology is /different/. The laws are /different/. The /culture/ is /different/, and /all of that/ influences how acceptable - or unacceptable - things like that would seem to the average child. All of these factors should be considered. Simply applying our values and morals without consideration is a bland, uninteresting approach to worldbuilding that completely ignores that the way things work for us /would not/ be the way things work for wizards with access to magic. The abilities at their disposal make it impossible for that.
