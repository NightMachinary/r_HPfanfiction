You ever played bloody knuckles? Fist/coin/deck of cards variants?

Wallball, or, where I come from, wall pock?

The circle game?

Five-star slaps?

Ever done cup checks in sports?

Hell, when I was a kid, me and my friends had this utterly stupid "game" where whenever we were sitting in a car together we'd hit each other hard as we could on the top of the thigh because that hurts extra for some reason.

Those are just the ones I remember off the top of my head. Kids and teenagers will do any number of juvenile /painful/ games. In a society where you can get injuries vanished in minutes, I can easily imagine schoolyard roughhousing becoming more extreme.
