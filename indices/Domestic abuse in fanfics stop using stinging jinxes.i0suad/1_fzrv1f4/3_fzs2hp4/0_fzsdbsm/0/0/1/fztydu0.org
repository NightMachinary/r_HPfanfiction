For sure, (wallball was my jam) but you have to remember a couple of things; one of the three most reviled curses only causes pain, and leaves no marks. There is a definite limit somewhere.

Second, these juvenile games aren't really acceptable as adults. Does the pain get worse an adult? No of course not. One would hope the adults would have a better understanding that even if there is no physical mark, pain is an issue all of its own. The adults we do see playing these types of games is considered immature at best and abusive / mentally unstable at worst.

The way this matches up with the magical world is likely skewed, but the universal hate for the cruciatus curse means that pain is given consideration when discussing immoral behaviors.
