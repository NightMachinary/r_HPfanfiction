It is worth remembering that injuries are simply less dangerous in the Harry Potter universe. Having every single bone in your arm vanished - gone entirely, from the larger ones to the tiny, fiddly ones that allow for your wrists and fingers to work properly, is an issue that gets solved in a single night, with the right potion. A fracture is dealt with in a fraction of a second. Injuries, thanks to magic, simply mean /less/.

This doesn't necessarily excuse casual violence from a moral standpoint, but it makes it much more believable and understandable that for children, who very often don't consider the consequences of their actions, to simply go "Ah, it's easily fixable by the infirmary. It doesn't matter, really." Because it doesn't, looking purely from a long term damage point of view. Those painful welts and those disfigurations are not even a minute's worth of inconvenience if you have any sort of medical proficiency. They're actually /less/ damaging in the long run than punches and slaps can be in real life.

That said there's still aspects that might not be pleasant and could be explored, and considering it would add for some useful context and discussion between people - it would make a lot of sense for people raised in a Muggle environment to have a different view on injuries than those raised in a magical environment. But it is, simply put, not the same in both, because magic inherently makes injuries mean something different.
