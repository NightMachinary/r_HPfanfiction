I think part of this person's point was less about how acceptable we might feel it is or isn't, but how people in the Wizarding world might view it. Every culture has a different definition of acceptable, so even if their behavior is intolerable, it can make sense for them to act that way and feel fine about it. Basically, due to the unique circumstances of the HP universe, it may be understandable that practices we would find horrify may be far more common and acceptable.

To be clear, I am not saying that any of these accepts are ever acceptable, only that as an author, they may be able to justify it as realistic given the circumstances.

I also think there are a bunch of other points that weren't specifically mentioned. For starters, as wizards are exposed to not only more danger, but also more pain (as a result of their more casual safety practices), so people likely have a very casual attitude towards pain, and most likely a higher pain tolerance in general.

Lastly, as mentioned in another comment, most fanfic's dial back how painful the hex is compared to canon. Most of the instances that I've seen, the hex has functioned more like a shock pen or any other minor pain that is more annoying than truly painful. Obviously if varies, but that's what I've seen.

So, given a more casual attitude towards both injury and pain, and the fact that the pain is often much less severe than in canon, I think it's realistic for behavior such as using the stinging hex casually on friends or partner to be considered socially acceptable. Whether that makes it right or not isn't always the point with fanfics. Sometimes it's more about what makes sense in the world.

As well, in many of the fics I've read the way the spell is described makes it so minor that even in this world nobody would consider it domestic violence or assault.
