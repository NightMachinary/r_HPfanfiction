While I agree with your point (a child raised in a magical society would not view injuries the same way a muggle child would), I don't think it should be translated by "couples could use stinging hexes on each other because they can heal it quickly without leaving any marks".

It may sound stupid, but pain is pain, and nobody "want" to feel pain. We (humans) accept pain as a byproduct of a different goal. We accept the posibility of being hurt when playing a game, but the main objectif is to have fun during the game. Some parents may also hurt their child a little (good old spank and slap) to discipline them, but the goal is to make the child link the pain with their bad action so they don't do it again (yeah not really accepted in current society but it was the goal). Even the masochistes seek the pleasure behind the pain and not the pain itself.

Anyways, my point is that, there are some context where I could accept the wizards being more "violent" thanks to their superior healing system. Quidditch sound like a death sentence for someone with muggle physique and medecine, their child could be more adventurous, and maybe even parent could use some hexes to discipline their child.\\
But, and to use OP example, having a couple use stinging hexes on each other does not sound acceptable, the same way muggle couple should not hit each other (some hit can heal quickly after all). And it's better to not talk about the whole "stinging hexes next to the boyfriend bits" (can't think at any worse tue l'amour than that).
