I don't really care about that. For me it depends in how you change it personality and if you justify it properly. There are some fics where they give stupid reasons in order to make Harry (or any other character) dark, or more independent. But in order to do that there are many ways, like creating an alternate universe where Harry was raised by Voldemort, for example.

I personally like when people change some aspects of the character, but only if it is realistic.
