I don't think it is that simple. As someone who ships Harmony, I care little whether Ron and Ginny are bashed or not. It may be entertaining, and it may serve for the author's plot, but I don't think many Harmony shippers view it as necessary to justify their ship. It is unfortunate that it is so widespread, but I for one relish fics where this is not the case.

Your critique seems to be more of the shippers than the ship itself, and I can agree with that assessment. It does get draining to always read about Weasleys who rely only on potions to pursue mere wealth or fame. Entertaining it may be, but even the most entertaining things grow boring after excessive viewing.

If I were to say that I ship Harmony because I find the concept of their relationship to be an ideal I should seek in my own romantic relationships, would that be a valid reason in your mind to ship Harmony? Would I be guilty of shipping an incestuous relationship, despite the fact that Harry and Hermione are not related by blood? I personally do not believe I would be. I have a sister, and the way I treat her is nothing like how I've read Hermione and Harry treating each other.

You may ship Romione and Hinny. Then good for you! Read all the fics! Share all the arts! Let your ships sail off into the sunsets, and I'll let mine sail into the dawns. We shall wave at each other in goodwill from the bows of our ships as we pass in the night.

Ship and let ship, my friend.
