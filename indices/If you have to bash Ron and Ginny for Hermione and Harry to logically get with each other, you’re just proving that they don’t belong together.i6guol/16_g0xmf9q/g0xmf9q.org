I'd say "prove" is a very strong word. That said, it's even more general than that. Any 'shipping-centred fic that rewrites one or both partners' personality from scratch or bashes a romantic competitor is an argument /against/ the 'ship. For example, just off the top of my head,

- /Harry Crow/: Harry and Hermione could be a lovely couple... if Harry were raised by goblins.
- Robstfic in general: Harry and Hermione are destined for each other... if Harry were a gentleman, a scholar, and a badass and Hermione had no personality.
- /What We're Fighting For/: Harry and Hermione could get together... if Harry were an emotionally stunted killing machine with a heart of gold and Hermione were isolated and helpless, with Ron being one of her biggest bullies.
- /Unsung Hero/: Harry and Hermione could happen... if Harry were much more hard-working, ambitious, intelligent, and level-headed.
- Majority of Dramione fics: Draco and Hermione could fall in love... if Draco were suave and steadfast, Hermione were a flighty ingenue with no personality or values, and Harry and Ron were crude, inept, and incapable of changing their mind about a person.
- Majority of Haphne fics: Harry and Daphne could be a real power-couple... if Daphne were a smart, cunning, skilled pureblood who is proudly neutral about Voldemort (as if it were a good thing) all is about Pureblood Culture and Traditions but is not at all prejudiced against Muggleborns.
