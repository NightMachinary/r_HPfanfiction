This conversation seems to have grown while I wasn't looking. Now I can't speak for the others, only myself, and yes I'm going to make an assumption about you... You seem like a purist, a Canan writer and that's fine, perfectly respectable but Canan writers tend to be very rigid in interpretation. As you said, there's no Canan to support the pair -- of course not, I wasn't saying their was...

Now stick with me. The second type of writer is AU writers. We -- myself among them --tend to look at fanfic as a tool, being in my opinion more creative and flexable, using Canon as a drawing board, but using fanfic to Fix or improve aspects of canan with plot-holes or haven't been fleshed out.

I did not mean that there is direct published Canon to support it no, but the /subtext/ does, having far more substance in terms of Friendship and years of interaction at Hogwarts as Best Friends then there is for H/G. Seems to me personally that JK basically forced it at the end, having said in an interview somewhere that she Started with the 19 yrs later epilogue and basically worked backwards

Now... Having said all that, I wish to be clear. *I don't care either way*. I like neither Ginny nor Hermione as characters. I'm a Gay guy and will stick to my Slash thanks
