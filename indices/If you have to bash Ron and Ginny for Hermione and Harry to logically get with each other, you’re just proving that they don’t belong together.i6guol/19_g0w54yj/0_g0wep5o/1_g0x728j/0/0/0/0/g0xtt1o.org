  JKR in all of her books pays amazing attention to detail.

Like Hagrid flying around a whole day with Harry whom he just picked up from the ruins? That's literally in the prolouge/chapter 1.

I only bothered to skim the first link, but that alone raises the most important narrative argument in favour of Hermione as romantic interest. Harry is the MC, Hermione is the female character with whom he interacts the most and with whom he goes through the most and worst shit. Like, not to rain on Ginny, but there was only one instance were she fought alongside Harry, and that was the DoM. Hermione was there for all but one adventure, where she was almost killed gathering crucial information.

  and Harry is too far from the high tier intelligentsia for them to be good together

Ron wasn't exactly better in that regard, if that argument moots H/Hr it also moots R/Hr.

An argument which convinces one person does not necessarily convince the rest. Case in point IMO it is pretty clear that Draco Malfoy committed the most war crimes in the series after Voldemort himself, war crimes for which even the allies outright executed people (perfidy in particular, but there's a long list). Yet despite me reaching that conclusion, not many others do, which proves that an individual "enlightenment" hardly makes a truth.

Each of these arguments does not sway most people, otherwise there would be only one OTP for this fandom.
