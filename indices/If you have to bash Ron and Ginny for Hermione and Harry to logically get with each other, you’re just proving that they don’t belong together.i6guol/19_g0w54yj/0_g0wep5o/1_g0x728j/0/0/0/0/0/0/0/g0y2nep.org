Ron and Hermione had nothing like Harry and Ginny. Let's say a Horcrux's effects are radiation. Ron and Hermione each are constantly on a desktop computer with a microwave cooking next to them. Ginny was in Hiroshima when the bomb dropped. Harry has had the Tsar Bomba dropped on him. For the chamber, while different, they both were there, and both almost died, with Ginny coming very close to death. For the resistance fighters one, my point isn't specifically them, my point is you can very easily say what their experience was. Only Harry and Ginny can understand each other's pain from those experiences they shared. And while being kidnapped is terrible, if Harry Potter was real, it would be a picnic compared to what he and Ginny would have gone through. Even if this isn't proof for Harry and Ginny, it is proof against H/Hr. Hermione's thirst for knowledge would have her push and push and push Harry to give her details and talk through it with her as if she was a pyschiatrist. Harry would hate this. And speaking of "For a good chunk", a) That doesn't have to be romantic, it could and in the end would be platonic, and b) What did they do without Ron? Nothing. Harry and Hermione is a fucking TERRIBLE team. Their only main successes ever as a team have been Sirius and the potions in TPS. You're missing all of the points, and underestimating how well Harry and Ginny would be able to understand each other. You clearly won't listen to reason, so I'm done.
