Ron and Hermione also had a Horcrux invading their minds, hence Ron leaving (unless you want to argue otherwise).

Ginny and Harry had vastly different experiences in the Chamber and Ginny was unconscious for the whole affair.

That would imply that someone else was fighting since all resistances had networks such as the Polish Home/National Arm, the French one or the White Rose.

The Order ran a radio show and that's it. A few people sprinkled across the countryside trying not to be caught also does not count as fighting. However, you unintentionally make a nice point there, the two or three months Harry and Hermione were alone are an experience no one else can relate to. Ron had his family to fall back to (as he did), the Order had their cozy radio station, everyone else was merely trying to survive. Yet for a good chunk of the hunt, it was literally Harry and Hermione against the World, literally the last people still fighting out in the field for the cause.

However, having a traumatic experience does not mean that you want a partner with the same experience. I was kidnapped when I was twelve and I'm certainly not looking for women who were kidnapped themselves.
