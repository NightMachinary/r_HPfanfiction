For point 1, you're cherrypicking. Point #2 is absolutely stupid. Because she's the main female protagonist, she goes with Harry? There are 3 things Ginny shared with Harry by the way, not two. She shares the chamber, which even if she didn't actually fight the basilisk, it is a traumatic experience only the two of them can share. The second is Tom Riddle having invaded their minds, practically raping them mentally. Again, only the two of them can share or understand it. The third is the DoM. All experiences Harry and Hermione share can be comprehended simply, and would be shared by most if not all resistance fighters in europe during WWII. Harry and Ginny's can't, only they can understand that, only they have the Horcrux having invaded their minds. Point 3 isn't read correctly and was accidentally taken out of context. I didn't use an Oxford comma there. I meant as a combination, they react terribly based on other personality traits in addition(E.g, Harry's stubbornness). For your last point, I'm not saying one does. I'm saying a COMPLETE analysis forces those who are willing to admit they were wrong to switch sides.
