Ok, so, first of all, addressing your reddit comment links, these are all about traits being noticed. This is not odd when put in context. One of the things that makes Harry Potter so great is that JKR in all of her books pays amazing attention to detail. This is just her writing style. The article "Giving Her The Power"(You can find easily on google, the website's called sugarquill) points out many of the same things with Ginny. Yes, it points out instances where he happens to notice Hermione and not Ginny, but these in the end are cherry-picked, and most come from moments where Harry is talking to Hermione or vice versa. Secondly, there is nothing here proving that Harry and Hermione work well together romantically. The two main times they were alone were the Horcrux hunt and the start of fourth year. Both times, morale was extremely low. To give a comparison, in second year, at times Harry was being treated much the same way he was in 4th year, but he was much happier. Why? Ron was with them. Bottom line, Hermione is too bossy and Harry is too far from the high tier intelligentsia for them to be good together. Lastly, you are wrong. I know you are. That might seem a little pompous, but let me explain. I started out as a fierce H/Hr shipper, probably the fiercest there was at my age in the entire US. However, I started re-reading the books. And less than a year ago, I looked at the problem with logical thinking. I watched YouTube videos from each side, read articles from each side, thinking they would prove H/G wrong and that I had foolishly overlooked something. And then, I got a huge shock. I was completely wrong. What did it for me was a video by a guy named BucReviewer, about H/G versus H/Hr. So don't give me more evidence, I've read all the points. I'm not going to switch my view. I switched it once, over a few months and many hours of reading and youtube videos. The ship is wrong, and that is just a basic fact. And to finish this off with a quote from Brennus:"Oh, and JKR never said that she should have paired them up: actually read the bloody interview before using it as supposed proof."
