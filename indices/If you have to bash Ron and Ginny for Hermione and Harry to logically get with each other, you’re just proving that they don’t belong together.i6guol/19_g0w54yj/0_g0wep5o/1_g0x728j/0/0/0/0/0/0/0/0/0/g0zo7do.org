Ok, so, the burden of proof isn't on me right now, it's currently on you. At this moment, I am asking you for proof. Btw, what bullshit is that? What else do they have in common? 1. Both can have a bad temper, but are very caring and willing to sacrifice themselves for those they love. 2. Both in some way feel the odd one out in their family(Harry being excluded from being granted basic human decency, Ginny being the only girl and not allowed to play Quidditch or have fun with her brothers). I could keep going on, but I'm not going to waste my morning like this. Having something in common is not just activities, it's personality traits which are compatible, which Harry and Hermione don't share.
