This argument always comes up. First of all, there is nothing in the books to suggest H/Hr. The two times they were both together without Ron, much like how they would be as a couple in an involved relationship, were start of book 4 and part of the Horcrux hunt. Both times they were unhappy, because they cannot get along for a good while based on their personalities. The second point of yours is insane. Ginny clearly gets over her crush, and sees Harry as Harry, not the boy-who-lived. I'm not even arguing this one.
