Listen, my main point isn't proof against, it's an absence of proof. Also, in 5th year Harry was also being ostracized, but he was much happier because his friends believed him. When it comes down to it, Harry and Hermione just don't work together well. Again, look in book 5 and see how Harry reacted when Hermione kept pushing him, and how Ginny got him to open up during Christmas and in the library. Before you reply to this again, I would encourage you to watch a video on YouTube by a guy called Bucreviewer about H/G vs. H/ Hr, and once you can reasonably counter that video, tell me why I'm wrong.
