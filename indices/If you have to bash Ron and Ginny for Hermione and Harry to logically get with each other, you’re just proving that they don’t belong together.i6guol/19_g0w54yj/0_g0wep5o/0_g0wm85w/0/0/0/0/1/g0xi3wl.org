Yeah that one might be on me awkward lol. Thats fair. I took a post about Bashing Ron & Ginny and essentially made it about Hermione and Ginny lol. But my point was that I don't really bash Ron or Ginny.

I explained how I see Ginny, and Ron. Ron has a lot of potential as a Character. I think his is Teenaged Jealousy & frankly some Anger management issues.

I actually think Anger Management would be a fun plot device it use to tackle the fandoms issues with Ron
