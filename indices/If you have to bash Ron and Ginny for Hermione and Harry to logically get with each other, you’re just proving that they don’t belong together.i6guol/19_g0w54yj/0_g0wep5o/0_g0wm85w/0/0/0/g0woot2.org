I'm not trying to fight the war, I'm trying to get people to stop spewing bullshit about how "Ginny is just a hero worshipper" or "JKR really just brought it out of nowhere, it isn't a very good ship". There's a difference between fighting a war and asking people to recognise that the ship is not a bad one.
