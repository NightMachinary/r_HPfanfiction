My issues with Hermione stem from Characterization, she annoys me greatly not the Harmony itself. I can understand that from a content POV. There's far more Content in the books to support H/Hr then H/G.

Most of Ginny's Obsession comes from the stories of the BWL as a child and the expectation, bolstered by her first yr disaster. She's got what I call Damsel syndrome.

Personally I agree with PutridBasket. Luna would have worked way better
