its like the most I care is kinda hoping two charcters who have chemistry get together but if it doesnt happen you just move on

its kinda weird treating it like a religion and holding onto it for decades

the only time I actively hate pairings is if the writting goes down the shit due to the pairing

like in arrow, the pairing was fine but the writting went to hell and the love interest started acting like a massive wanker while the show acted like she could do nothing wrong so the pairing was bad as it ruined a charcter I enjoyed but thats mostly due to the writting of said relationship
