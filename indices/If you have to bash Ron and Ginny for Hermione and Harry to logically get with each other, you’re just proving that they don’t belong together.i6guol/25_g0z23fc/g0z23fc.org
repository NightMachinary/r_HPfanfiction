Ive seen plenty of ships and tbh what makes me drop it when theh writing is horrible or they go out of character for no good reason. Tbh ron and hermione had their awful moments which i disliked but i never hated them.

Bashings just a huge red flag to me. Most of the time, i drop them at first chap.
