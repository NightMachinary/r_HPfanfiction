That is because you always start these "arguments". Like, literally every time I see you you're in some way flaming or insulting people. or calling them "stans", whatever that means. You're projecting your own investment into this... situation onto others and it's major cringe.

If everyone you meet seems to be an asshole, then you are the asshole.
