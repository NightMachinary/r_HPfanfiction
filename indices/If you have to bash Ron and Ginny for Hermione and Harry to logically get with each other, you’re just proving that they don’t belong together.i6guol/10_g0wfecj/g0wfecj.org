I don't have to bash Ron or Ginny to prove - to my own satisfaction - that Harry and Hermione should be together. But sometimes it's fun. Like reading crack fics, or reading a pairing or premise I don't usually find interesting.

Are you angry that people don't stick religiously to the canon pairings, or that people bash characters they don't like?
