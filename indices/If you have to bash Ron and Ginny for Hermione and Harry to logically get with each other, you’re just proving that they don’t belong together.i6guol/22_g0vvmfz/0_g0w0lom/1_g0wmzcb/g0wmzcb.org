  Bashing doesn't ever make sense
#+end_quote

Objection, crack is perfect for bashing.

There's a famous German YT parody where Quidditch is teleshopping, the Weaselys are inbread and practice incest, Dumbledore finances the school with CP since his rap career does not earn enough, Slytherin is gay (with Potions being a special class for hardcore stuff "without lube"), Hermione a lesbian who got petrified/rubberised from a faulty sex toy which pornstar and professor Fuckhard (Lockhart) sold and everyone is a horny idiot 24/7.

It is utterly hilarious because it is so far out that you can't take it serious. Bashing only sucks if you get the feeling that the author is serious about what they write.
