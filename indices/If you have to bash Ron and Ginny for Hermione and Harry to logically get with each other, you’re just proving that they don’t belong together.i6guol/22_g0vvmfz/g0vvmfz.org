It makes sense for Hermione fans to bash Ron, since he's her most prominent antagonist in the books. Bashing Ron isn't an argument that Ron is bad, it's just indulging in being mean to someone who's canonically mean to their favorite character.

I mostly like Ron because I like Harry and their friendship, so I mostly avoid Ron bashing, but I get it.

I really enjoy when Draco is humiliated and I don't think that makes the case for Drarry, Dron or Dramione any stronger.
