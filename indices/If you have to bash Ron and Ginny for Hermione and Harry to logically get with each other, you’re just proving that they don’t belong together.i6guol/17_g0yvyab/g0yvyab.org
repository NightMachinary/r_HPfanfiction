No, it just proves that the author is poor at writing. Harry and Hermione /can/ get along without Ron and Ginny getting bashed, if it is written right. Most people writing such stories already don't care much about those two characters, so it is just easier to shove them to one side and use them for comedic/antagonist/insignificant purposes.

Personally, I don't think Harry/Hermione pairing works at all if you take them at canon value, both or either must go through heavy change in the fanfiction story in order for it to be organic. Harry doesn't like pushing himself when there's no necessary need for it, he's content with being above average, while Hermione is far too judgemental of those who don't value the things she does, such as studying and academic excellence.

Whenever there's a fight in the Trio - Scabbers/Crookshanks and Firebolt in PoA, Harry as Triwizard Champion in GoF, and Won-Won/Lav-Lav in HBP - Harry finds his time spent with Hermione to be dull and uninspiring. He prefers Ron's company unless there's something necessary he needs to figure out which is when he goes towards Hermione. Their pairing simply won't work because canon!Harry is not interested in studying and other pursuits that Hermione is in, and canon!Hermione is very serious and doesn't like wasting her time with unproductive tasks or laze around doing nothing of note.
