Jesus Christ, this. Not Harry and Hermione specifically, but just shipping in general. Heck, writing in general.

When fanfic authors engage in heavy-handed character bashing and contrived situations and plots to get their favorite ship together, I think "Who are you kidding?" And also "What's the point?"

If you have to bullshit that hard to justify your plot, you're just admitting that you can't make it work.
