Idk, there is an absurd amount of hate for Harry/Ginny. While in an ideal world the bashing should be unnecessary, if they don't bash Hermione their review section will be filled with people who refuse to accept the pairing and endlessly complain that Harry and Hermione should be together.

Bashing a character is the quickest way to get readers who are obsessed with that character to fuck off and read something else
