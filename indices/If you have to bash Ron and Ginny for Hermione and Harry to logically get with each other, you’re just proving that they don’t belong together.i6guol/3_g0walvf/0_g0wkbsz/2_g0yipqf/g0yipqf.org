  But this was a downright lie. Harry liked Hermione very much, but she just wasn't the same as Ron. There was much less laughter and a lot more hanging around in the library when Hermione was your best friend.

Lol dude's still spending time with her, it's just that his relationship with Hermione is different to the one with Ron. If one of your best friends suddenly cuts you off it's normal to miss them and that dynamic. Harry still says he liked her very much. Are we expecting a 14 year old boy to not miss hanging out with his bro? Ron would feel the same way if he was alone with Hermione lol. And this is at 14, we see their personalities shift over the course of the books. This is always what I find vaguely ridiculous about shipping arguments, we're debating lifelong relationships from what these people are at 14. Who I vibe with now is different from who I vibed with at 14.

In real life, Idk if Harry and Hermione's personality would mesh well together if they just met and hadn't been through anything formative, but I think the strength of the experiences they've shared creates a strong enduring bond which means they could work through any difficulty, especially in post-Hogwarts fics where everyone's older and more mature and I see evidence of that bond in canon. I could see Ron and Hermione working but I think it would be more difficult, and I feel like the bond between Harry and Hermione in canon just seems stronger and steadier. If I found someone the relationship I'd want with them would be with the strength of the bond that Harry/Hermione share.
