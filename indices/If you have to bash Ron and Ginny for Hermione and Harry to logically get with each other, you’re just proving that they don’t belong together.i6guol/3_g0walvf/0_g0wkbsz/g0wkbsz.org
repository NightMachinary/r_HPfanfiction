You know what is a better (canon supported) reason why Harry/Hermione makes no sense?

The fact everytime Ron got into a spat with either Hermione or Harry, and so Harry and Hermione interacted as a duo rather than as a trio, Harry found himself hating it.

Seriously - he found it boring beyond belief - go read Prisioner of Azkaban when Ron refused to talk to Hermione after the Firebolt incident, or GOF after Harry is choosen as a Champion or hell even Half Blood Prince - When Hermione gets offended at Harry using the book and Ron stops talking to her.

Every single time Harry's reaction is the same - he finds himself underwhelmed and somewhat bored. They're just not good together as a pair.
