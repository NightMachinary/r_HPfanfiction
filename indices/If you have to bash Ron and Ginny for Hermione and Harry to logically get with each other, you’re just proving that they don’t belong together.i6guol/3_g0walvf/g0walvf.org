You're not proving anything. Bashing is stupid but there are plenty of non-bashing stories where Harry and Hermione get together. Vox Corporis is probably the best example. Unlike a sister does it differently.

Bashing Ron and Ginny to get Hermione and Harry together is lazy writing, and probably genuine bad writing, but it doesn't prove anything about the HHr pairing.
