I'm glad you asked, in the comments of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPharmony/comments/gmtzvs/how_hhr_pairing_makes_sense_for_you_in_the_books/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][this post]], you can find several arguments to the validity of HHr as a couple, as well as dozens of essays examining the two characters and their relationship. Not only that but one user on the subreddit recently wrote a four-part essay detailing the evolution of Harry's attraction to Hermione with evidence straight from the text as well as renowned psychological studies.

But if you want my recommendation specifically for strong evidence, I can direct you to a saga of 7 books written by JK Rowling called the Harry Potter series.
