You can deny it all you want or masquerade it as delusional fandom-misinterpretation, but in reality, there are many reasons Harry and Hermione would make a good couple, with evidence to the fact littered throughout the text. Bashing is a trope that has generally fallen out of favour with every corner of the fandom. Very few popular HHr stories nowadays have much bashing in them at all (Strangers on a Train being a notable example that directly goes against bashing of any sort).

The ones that do often are there to fulfil an anti-establishment, adolescent power-fantasy, where magical prowess equates to sexual dominance, in which case the actual object of desire is interchangeable and often multiple. HHr stories often are brought up as examples of this, notably due to an excessive backlash to the idea from canon shippers, when really any ship is guilty of this. It's just common practise for inexperienced writers to demonise one side to make the other seem more logical, it's hardly a habit exclusive to writers of one ship. Why HHr gets the most flack for this, I can only guess, but the popularity of these stories certainly springs to mind, that and the pairing of HHr directly contradicts not one integral canon ship but two.

A lot of HHr stories partake in hints of bashing, but mostly it's done to expose character flaws in certain characters and allow them to grow from it, which is a treatment that is consistent with the main pairing too. There are also stories without external bashing where Hermione and Harry are deliberately brought to task for their own failures and forced to grow from that conflict. One example is Hermione Granger is Stupid.

Perhaps that is the point of your post then, that those who rely on bashing to facilitate a relationship are flawed writers, but the fact that it is framed around HHr in particular wreaks of ignorance. Nuff said
