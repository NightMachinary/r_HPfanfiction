What's wrong with Tonks/Harry? I mean, I know that she's a little bit older than him, and they barely interacted with one another in canon, and they are related to one another, but she is not that much older than him (a 7 year age difference between her and Harry, compared to the age difference between her and Lupin which is almost double that at 13 years conservatively), fanfics can change the amount of interaction time between them so that they can get to know one another better develop a romantic relationship, and as for being related to one another, that's through a Great Grandmother, and possibly due to marriage only (I'm a little iffy on the details of the family tree there) making them 2nd or 3rd cousins if I'm not mistaken, which while a bit squicky isn't unheard of, even outside of the wizarding world.

BTW I'm personally more of a fan of Hermione/Harry.
