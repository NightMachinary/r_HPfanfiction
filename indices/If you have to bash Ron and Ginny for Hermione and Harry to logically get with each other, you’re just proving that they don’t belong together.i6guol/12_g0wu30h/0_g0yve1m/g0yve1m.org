This.

Snape and Draco do not deserve sympathy They do not deserve the honor of a relationship with any of the golden trio (although I must admit, they idea of either of them with RON has a lot of potential as a crack fic) Snape is an unmitigated asshole And any Draco that isn't OOC has been ruined beyond repair by Lucius.
