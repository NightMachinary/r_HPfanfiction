I would say, rather, that the story has failed to prove that they belong together, which is not the same as proving that they don't.

It could be considered weak evidence that they don't belong together; one person who sincerely believed it turned out to have a flawed argument, therefore it's /slightly/ more likely that there are no good arguments. It's far from conclusive by itself, though.
