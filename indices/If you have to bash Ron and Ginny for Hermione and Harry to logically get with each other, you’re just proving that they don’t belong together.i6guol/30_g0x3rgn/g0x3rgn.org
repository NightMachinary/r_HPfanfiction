Honestly neither of the two male leads are good for Hermione in my opinion, at, least with what is presented to us in the novels. Neither is intellectually at her level which is why many stories trying to get them together forces Harry to become uncharacteristically interested in learning, Ron to be a strategic genius or some such, or Hermione basically ignore Hermione's love of knowledge.

Honestly the second and third tier characters make the best love interests because we don't know a lot about them so they're easy to fill in to more easily mesh with the main characters. Haphne is a meme but it can be done in an interesting and well written manner. Luna as a love interest is hard To write correctly but anything you want can be behind the dreamy mask, or it could not be a mask at all. Sue Bones apparently has huge breasts according to every Fan Fic ever but besides that she can match your stories version of Harry perfectly. Tonks and Ginny also fit here.

It's funny to me that some of these second and third tier characters have somehow developed their own semi consistent personalities so now we're turning to new third tier characters so people can keep trying to make a girl their perfect match for Harry. Tracey Davis is popping up more often, Harry and grown up Gabriel has become almost common place, and it seems like just about any girl around his age is matched to him at this point.

There is no right ship. That's right I said it.
