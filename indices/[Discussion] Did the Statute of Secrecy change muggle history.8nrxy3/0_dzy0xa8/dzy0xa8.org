  When was the Sstatue of Secrecy passed, and how does that compare to the timeline of rationalism and scientific methods becoming popular?

1692, and yes, that does tie neatly to science starting its rise. Although it's not cause and effect, as the likes of Robert Boyle had been notable for doing actual science for thirty or more years at that point. It's the period when Isaac Newton (TOTALLY a wizard) was keeping his alchemy on the down-low and publishing only his mundane science and mathematics. One suspects he was one of those figures who had to choose which world to remain in when the Statute passed, the fact of his magic being part of why the historical record of the man is so decidedly /odd/.

And yes, Egypt up to the end of the Ptolemaic period was definitely run by wizards. The magic that the kings of Egypt were required to practise is recorded on papyri, monuments and temple walls - they couldn't erase it all, not least because quite a lot of it was buried - and the best they could hope for would be it being put down to myth.

(Which suggests that the Nile Valley is to magic as the Zone Rouge is to the First World War. Absolutely /lousy/ with contamination and unexploded ordnance such that the projected clean-up time measured in centuries. Which is what the Gringotts teams are actually doing there, the recovered treasure just being a bonus.)

There are also a lot of old stories about Christian clergy being able to work magic, some of them as late as the 9th century. In our universe, just myth-making. In the Potterverse, the fragments of real history that made it through the editing process.
