I think it's more Anglocentric than that: the statue was signed in 1689, the same year as the English Bill of Rights, and the Ministry of Magic was subsequently founded in 1707, the same year as the Acts of Union between England and Scotland.

JKR has stated in interview that she tries to have events in the Muggle and magical worlds mirror each other, and I think here she has attempted to have Muggle and magical moments of huge constitutional change coincide. It's simply an artefact of the books being set in Britain that the international statue mirrors domestic British politics.
