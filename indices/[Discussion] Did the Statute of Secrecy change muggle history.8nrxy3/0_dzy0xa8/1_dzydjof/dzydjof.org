If I had to guess, Rowling picked 1692 because its the date of the famous Salem Witch Trials. Its somewhat ironic since, while horrible and definitely not a high point for Magical/Muggle relations, it pales in comparison to events like the Spanish inquisiton. Hell, Hammurabi laid out a procedure for dealing with magical or magically affected people that is more or less in line with the Puritans' methods, and that was 3500 years beforehand.

To speculate, the magical societies of the world were probably debating this decision for decades or even centuries. Possibly, it was already being instituted in certain regions where more trouble had already occurred (I can see Italy getting in on this earlier). But now an entirely new land was discovered. And what happened? Two hundred years of direct and indirect genocide or subjugation of the population, often enforcing certain beliefs on both the invaders and invaded. Finally, the last straw. People fled to escape persecution (or perceived anyway) in Europe, and they still persecuted others for not following their beliefs or ideals.

Most big events in history are like this. A long creep towards a particular outcome, followed by a trigger that leads a sweeping change in the world.
