Thats right! I had forgotten the Thirty Years War happened just before that.

The thing is, I think you might be assuming a bit more unity in the magical world. Magical society appears to have remained stagnant with regard to most of the developments in the muggle world for the next three centuries. There are multiple possible reasons for why this is: ignorance of muggles in general due to their isolation, attempts to preserve a unique magical culture separate from the muggles, or simply a desire to not change the way things are.

In this regard, the wizarding world is almost like the Fallout-universe. Cultural development stagnated due to a large change in the circumstances, and was maintained through either by choice or happenstance. Nations were largely independent of one another at that time, with conflicts being where most people met or interacted with the peoples of other nations (this is generalization, not true of everyone, just like magicals). The magical world seems to have mostly kept the former governmental styles prior to the SoS. The nations of the magical world seem to largely stay out of each others issues, as one can deduce from the apparent lack of response by any other nation or force to either rise of Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Nations where magical societies formed after the SoS was passed probably ended up being more like the current governmental style of there muggle counterparts.
