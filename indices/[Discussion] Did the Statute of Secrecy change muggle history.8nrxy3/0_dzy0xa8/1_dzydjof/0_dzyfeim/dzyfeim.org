Well, that might be Rowling's reason for picking that year, but it doesn't make a lot of sense for the final outcome of a leglislative/political process, no matter how long debated. My own view is that it's the outbreak of the Nine Years War, 1689, one of the first wars to really go global. Most of the magicals who were politically prominent by that time would have been children or young adults at the end of the Thirty Years War - /notorious/ for the witchhunts that went on during the fighting, which was only the headline act for a century of utter mayhem - and it would be easy to use a sentiment of "Never again" to call an international summit and drive through the Treaty that's enacted in the constituent ministries as the International Statutes.
