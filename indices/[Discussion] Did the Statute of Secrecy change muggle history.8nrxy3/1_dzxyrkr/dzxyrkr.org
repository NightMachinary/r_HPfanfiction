When was the Sstatue of Secrecy passed, and how does that compare to the timeline of rationalism and scientific methods becoming popular?

I feel like there would be a connection there - with magic no longer being something you can point to as an explanation, other methods would be needed to fill the gap. Science didn't have to be the one to take over, but it did, and now muggles don't just live separate lives, a huge chunk of them imagine the universe according to totally different rules.

EDIT: Cleopatra was totally a witch, and it's likely that many Egyptian, Roman, and Greek nobles were as well. Probably dang near every pharaoh, a significant number of Hellenic kings, and I wouldn't be shocked to find out most senators were technically wizards.

Ballpark: India would make wizards their own jats, of course, and probably their own varna: the Bhramins. China would have been run by wizards until the Yuan dynasty at least - and the Ming might have all been closet wizards.

Second edit: 1692 is in the Qing dynasty - so that probably means basically all of the Chinese Empire had wizards near the top, and the inability to keep using magic to solve international problems may have been a big factor in the Century of Humiliation. Which leads to the question of how the PRC deals with wizards. I could see them going either way, really.
