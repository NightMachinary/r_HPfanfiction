You sort of run into a tricky thing with Cleopatra: she was a descendant of the Ptolomaic dynasty that took over after Alexander kicked it (they were Macedonians). So she wouldn't be quite the same as the previous pharoahs during the Old/Middle/New Kingdom. Its kind of interesting to think she was a parselmouth though: she ordered the serpent to kill her to prevent humiliation by Octavion.

India is an interesting case, since the Vedas speak of so-called superhuman individuals that roamed the sub-continent. Its hard to identify any famous cases that might have been changed to fit muggle histories though.

WIth China I see them being something like the source of a large amount of the potioneering and alchemical theory, and this gave them a huge advantage over less advanced societies around them. You could preface this that the steppe nomads around them (like the Tatars or the Jurchin) attacked so they could get ahold of these secrets held by the imperial courts of the various dynasties. I can also see them somewhat elevating most if not all the talented magical practitioners to positions in the bureaucracy, in large part to control the available knowledge and secrets.

I had an interesting thought that William Shakespeare was a master of emotional magics and/or sound magics, and used these to identify the most moving phrases and stories for his plays.
