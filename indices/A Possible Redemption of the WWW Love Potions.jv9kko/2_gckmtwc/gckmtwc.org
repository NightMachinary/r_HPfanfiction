The only thing even remotely close to love potions that I might give a pass is something that prompts someone to look at a person objectively and judge them by actions, suppressing their existing prejudices, and where tolerance build-up is rapid. And even that is dubious; prejudices aren't all bad, they can help you survive by discouraging you from associating with people you know are likely to bring you harm.

Love potions are immoral unless consent is given, and that was clearly not the case with WWW potions.

My headcanon for why they're legal in first place is that the Wizarding World is still into arranged marriages, and love potions can be used to force passion if you were unable to legitimately fall for your match. This does NOT make them okay, it only explains them being legal.
