One of the folks I used to follow on Tumblr had a series of askblog-based AUs, one of which, [[https://luminousalicorn.tumblr.com/tagged/potions/chrono]["potions"]], was written by somebody who (1) had been dosed by a love potion, (2) was now brewing that love potion to keep dosing herself, and (3) would happily debate the ethics of love potions with anyone who cared to ask.

It is so incredibly weird to read.
