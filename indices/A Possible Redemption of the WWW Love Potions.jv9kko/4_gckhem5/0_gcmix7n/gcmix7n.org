I like this idea. On one hand, the potion will have no effect on the target if they don't already hold an attraction to someone. But on the other hand it can still be dangerous/immoral because it forces someone to act in a way that might be outside their comfort zone. In other words it nullifies some of the darker aspects while retaining its questionable effects.

Also, I can see some psycho types justifying their use of the potion because /if/ it works, then "It's fine, because they already liked me to begin with."

Someone like Merope Gaunt might have used that excuse.
