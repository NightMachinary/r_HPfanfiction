Considering mind control/mind wipe is considered a civic duty of the wizarding population so as to maintain the Statute of Secrecy, I don't feel like a kissing potion would be as any sort of harm. I don't think love potions should be made or used, but the fact is they are something that exists and a 'part' of the wizarding world. Fred and George are also not ones to think much about the potential harm their products can cause.
