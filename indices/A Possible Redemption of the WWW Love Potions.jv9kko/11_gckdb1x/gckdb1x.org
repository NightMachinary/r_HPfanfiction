But almost all magic is shown to be as moral as its intended use instead of possessing an inherent morality. Even Crucio is called "gallant" by McGonagall when Harry uses it on one of the Carrows. Not to get dark, but Petrificus totalus could be used for rape or sexual assault, and it's a first-year spell.

I think the WWW love potions were meant to be taken more seriously by readers than some people suggest. One of those love potions indirectly leads to Ron almost dying, and WWW sold the Peruvian darkness powder the Death Eaters use the night Dumbledore is murdered. There is a dark side to the Wizarding World, even the "good" part of it.
