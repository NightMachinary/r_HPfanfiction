What about treating it as a mental suggestion potion? Key word being 'suggestion'; when you drink it you get the mental equivalent of 'Prompt; declare your love to Oriana Chadwick' (or if you prefer, Selene Innsbrook) and a little 'go on, you can do it' nudge.\\
So the only real effect would be to reduce your inhibitions/nerves, and point you in a direction; your actions (and how silly they are) would be up to you.\\
