Mind control is mind control, imagine being forced to cuddle with someone you find disgusting or personally hate, or not even do any action but make you feel atraction towards someone you really don't.

It's still horrifying, it's a potion that violates the body and the mind taking away your control of both, even with reduced effects it would be way worse than just embarrassing.
