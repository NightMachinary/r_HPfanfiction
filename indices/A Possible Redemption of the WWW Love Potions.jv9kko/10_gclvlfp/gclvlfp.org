My take on it is that the less dangerous ones (Amortentia excluded) is that they are aphrodisiacs that enhance the desire for a specific person. In real life, oysters are powerful aphrodisiacs but you don't lose control after eating them and in order for them to have an actual effect on the brain, you still need to be attracted to the person. Ron was a teenage boy and, as most horny teenage boys, he found attractive most decently looking girls. Also in the books it's stated that the more aged the potion, the more potent it gets, which was probably was a side effect that the twins not aware of. All in all, love potions are not considered dark magic in universe and most likely the consumer still has some autonomy over their decisions.
