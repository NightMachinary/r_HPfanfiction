linkffn( The Choices We Make by seventhSINwrath)

â€‹

unfortunately, it's only a one-shot and doesn't get too much into snape personally getting rejected what I liked about it was the people who decided on the arranged marriage didn't get their way.

there's also another snape/harry arranged marriage one shot where Harry actually does go through the wedding about is not happy about it and makes his feelings known to everyone. Snape is in love with Harry in this one too and I loved how Harry didn't give a shit but I stopped reading halfway tho because of didn't like how Harry changed his mind about Snape. id send a link but forgot the name
