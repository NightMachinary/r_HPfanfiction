I can imagine Lavender and Parvati writing fanfics.

Parvati would be the kind to write rare pair one shots as a gift to Lavender for on special holidays or something.

Lavender would write a 500k+ angsty slow burn fic following multiple characters and their relationships. Heavy drama and lots of smut. Includes every trope you can think of. Cheating, accidental pregnancy, amnesia, secret second family, enemies to lovers, mutual pining, forced bed sharing, love potions, time travel, major character death, etc...
