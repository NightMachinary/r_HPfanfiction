Gwendoline Cedrella Weasley (Born March 1st, 1980) (Vaguely Arthurian name and grandmother's name. Was pressured upon by said grandmother. We are not making fem!Ron an earlier Weasley girl named Ginny, as that defeats the point of making fem!Ron)

Ginny still exists, but is the unintentional seventh Weasley child. Accidents happen.

The first thing Fem!Ron is distinct in is her appearance. As with normal Ron, she is her father's child, which translates to being tall and lanky, at least initially, with blue eyes. Because of rapid growth, a bit clumsy.

Second is her character. Genderbending Ron from birth would indeed change his character significantly. Fem!Ron remains awkward and rather skinny until she goes through puberty rather late, at which point she grows into her looks as a rather beautiful girl. (Tropes are tropes but an ugly duckling trope works best here). Gwen, as she is commonly called, is more traditional than Ginny, and often helps her mother in the household, while remaining a Quidditch afficionado. This leads to Gwen becoming a force to be reckoned with in the kitchen, rivaling her mother. She just has a knack for it.

Gwen is not as close to her father and brothers, or even Ginny, because of being her mum's unconscious favorite, and being a bit more of a girly girl they find themselves hard to identify with at that age.

Instead, she drifts to her mother and grandmother, Cedrella Weasley, who she is named for. It is from her she learns to pennypinch to a near notorious degree, to save up for things she really wants. When they were all still really young, Grandma Weasley tried to learn them to save up money for more fun things. Aside from Percy, before her, no-one listens, and neither will Ginny. Gwen cautiously saves up for a second-hand broom and a new wand, and some other things for when she goes to Hogwarts. Grandma Weasley personally makes up the difference.

She does eventually buy a second-hand broom, but Fred and George are jealous, and steal it to fly on in the night. There, it gets destroyed. If you thought Molly Weasley Howlers were bad, boy, you are in for a treat. She had to learn it from someone, and that someone was Grandma Weasley. After that incident, Gwen has a frosty relationship with her twin brothers.

Younger Fem!Ron is insecure because of her appearance, and Harry is more gallant about it than most. He comes to love her despite of it. Harry at this point in time is still much of a runt himself, coming fresh from years of canon Dursley, so he sympathizes with her.

She is also a bit more organized and pro-active, as she does not wish to disappoint her Gran. Neither does she have atrocious eating habits, because she always was seated close to her mother and grandmother at dinner, and it was quickly stamped out.
