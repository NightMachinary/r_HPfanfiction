Yeah, I've had to do that for the fic I'm working on, because critical plot points require either moving canon 10 years forward, or completely rewriting much of the history of the 80s and 90s.

For now it's not hard to do - I can just have everyone whose age is important be born 10 years later, and have Voldie wait an extra 10 years studying and traveling before starting the first Blood war.
