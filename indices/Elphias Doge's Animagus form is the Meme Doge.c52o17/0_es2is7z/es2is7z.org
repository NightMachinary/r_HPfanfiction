It was days like this one that made Harry regret taking up the Potter seat on the Wizengamot. As a junior member, the man-who-conquered was placed on "whichever committee no one else wanted", which was why he was sitting in a conference room with eight wizards and two witches. The topic of debate was whether the penalty for violating import rules for potions ingredients should be stricter than the penalty for violating import rules for flying carpets.

The committee had been arguing for twenty minutes when it happened. Elphias Doge, the oldest wizard in the room, had quietly dozed off in his chair, letting the argument proceed without him. Harry noticed, but said nothing.

Daniel Greengrass, however, was not as patient as Harry. Leaning over, he shook Doge's shoulder. "Oi, Doge, wake up!" he said.

Elphias opened his eyes and glared at Lord Greengrass. The room had quieted, and everyone looked at the elder member of the committee.

Doge sighed. "If you lot are just going to talk in circles, then I'll sit here and stare at you." Before anyone could reply, Doge shifted into his animagus form. The (very good) dog sat in the high-backed chair, his head tilted slightly, his eyes focusing on nothing in particular.

All activity in the room had ceased, as everyone stared at the unnerving creature before them. Then, after a moment, the silence was broken by a snort of laughter from Harry Potter.

"Such Merlin," he said between laughs. "Much win."

"Woof," replied Elphias Doge, happy that someone finally got the joke.
