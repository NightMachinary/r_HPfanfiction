I purposefully left the identity of both the Professor and the Mother vague, so anything's fine. I expect that, if someone does pick up my humble prompt, it'll involve Hermione in some way, since she's one of the most popular characters to write about regarding Harry romances/tragedies.

I'd hope that lesser-used characters are attempted, though.

As for "bashing"... eh . Bashing has the literary substance of sugar: it's good for a craving, but it has the substance of empty calories.
