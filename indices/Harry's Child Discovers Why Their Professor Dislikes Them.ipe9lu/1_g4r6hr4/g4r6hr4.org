Version 1(Disclaimer, I don't think Hermione would /ever/ act like that towards a child(or a breakup), she might be vindictive towards the parent, but not the child, it's just not in her):

Lilian Potter was confused, her Defense Professor was supposed to be a great witch, she was called a hero for the Wizarding World, helped her father defeat Voldemort, and was widely regarded as a genius. She had been really excited to be taught by her.

But Professor Granger seemed to dislike her, rather badly.

She did not do anything untoward, she did not berate her, or scream at her for no reason, and she graded her work and tests fairly.

But every opportunity she had, she would punish Lilian for the littlest offense, discounting more points than normal, and even when Lilian excelled in class, she would either give her less points, or just congratulate her without looking.

Now, if Lilian had been a bad student, or a rowdy one(like the Weasleys) she would kind of understand, but Lilian was a quiet student like her mother had been, much different than her adventurous father.

And this only happened with Professor Granger, the other teachers and staff would fawn over her, they would say she had her father's eyes, but otherwise looked just like her mother.

Headmistress McGonagall would be one of those to say that and look at her fondly.

She asked her cousin Scorpius, who always had an ear in the grapevine, but he told no student knew, since when not with Lilian, Professor Granger was a fair and kind teacher. He had asked his mother, but she had evaded the question, only guaranteeing it wasn't Lilian's fault, while his father just told him it was family business, but had remarked it was 'ironic' or something.

Lilian was a smart girl, she had been placed in Gryffindor because she was brave, and because her mother's House just wasn't as fit for her.

She learned that her father, Professor Granger and Mr. Wesley had been great friends at school, so she asked Rose, one of her best friends.

Rose pulled her into an empty classroom and started casting privacy charms like they were going out of style.

"Look, Lils, I am only telling you this because it's involving you and you are getting hurt, and I think it's wrong, but please /don't/ tell anyone you heard it from me okay, I heard it from Victorie, who overheard her parents, so it's probably the real deal.

"Ok, Rose, I won't tell."

The redhead took a deep breath.

"Okay, so Granger and your dad, back when they were in school, they were dating."

Lilian's eyes widened, she had suspected something like this, but had discarded because she couldn't imagine her extremely kind and thoughtful dad having a bad breakup.

"Wow. So she hates me because she's my father's ex."

"It's not your dad, it's your mum."

"What!? They knew each other?"

"I don't know, I know they, as in Professor Granger and your dad, were dating, and then something happened, and he broke up with her and started dating your mum."

Lilian really wasn't liking where this was going.

"So, she hates me because I look like mum?"

"I think so, yes, look, Victorie implied it was bad, apparently her parents talked about a duel, a really bad one, they trashed the living room and it got to a point your dad intervened and had to disarm them, Aunt Fleur had to run damage control, the Minister himself had to pull some serious moves to keep the media out of it, and Dad was torn between the two, it's why they are not so close anymore, and why grandmother doesn't like your mum that much."

"But Mrs. Weasley likes me."

Rose smiled, "Of course she does, you are the perfect granddaughter who's all proper and she can't wait until you get there so you can talk about girly stuff."

Lillian huffed, she had already 'resigned' herself at being considered an honorary Weasley along with her dad, she then noticed her mother may not be included.

"So, what do I do? It's not my fault."

"I know, but you look like a younger version of your mother, only with your father's eyes, you are like a walking reminder."

"Do you think my dad...that he...cheated on Professor Granger and left her for my mum?"

Lilian didn't like to think like that, her parents had always been her role models, her father was kind, passionate, and heroic, he always made time for his family, always showered them with love, her mother was a bit more reserved, some thought aloof, but she was always there for her family, and always showed love for her and her father, who made a game of getting a reaction from her.

They always looked like the perfect couple, the brave knight and the fair lady, it was hard to reconcile that with her father cheating on his girlfriend and leaving her for her mother, who would know what was happening.

"Hey! Lils, get that look out of your face! I really doubt that, your father simply isn't the type, and Victorie said they broke up and then your father got with your mother, the duel was after all that happened."

Rose placed a hand on her friend's shoulder, "Look, maybe this is still too recent, or you being here has made her remember it all again, and with the time she's going to get used to it, and it's not /so/ bad, right?

She was right, maybe it would improve with time.

It didn't.
