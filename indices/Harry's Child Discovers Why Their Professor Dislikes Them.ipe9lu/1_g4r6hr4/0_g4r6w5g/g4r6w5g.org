When Lilian was in her third year, and started growing into her looks, it started getting a bit worse, with Professor Granger actually scowling at her, and something her eyes would show aggression that was really weird on the otherwise nice woman.

Lilian didn't want to bring her parents into this, her father was very protective, and would probably march into the school, and her mother, well, if they dueled before...

But now she had to worry about her little brother, who was coming to Hogwarts next year, James was her opposite, he looked like father, but acted like their mother, it was such a certainty he was going to Slytherin her Uncle Draco had bought him a green uniform for Quidditch, much to her father's consternation.

She didn't want to know how Professor Granger would treat him, and she knew that he had a temper, and wouldn't stand for it.

She had to solve this.

She thought about going to Professor McGonagall, but what could she do? Professor Granger didn't do anything /wrong,/ she still graded her work fairly, and never raised her voice, but her looks and some of the things she started saying.

"Miss Potter, your handwriting still has ways to go."

"You need to hold your wand properly Miss Potter, these are offensive spells, not make up."

"Miss Potter, by your age your father could cast a corporeal Patronus, your performance is, not as impressive."

The proverbial straw in the camel's back came in a visit to Hogsmeade, when she, Scorpius, and Rose went to buy some books and met Professors Granger and Longbottom as they were leaving.

Lilian was dressed in casual clothing for that, enjoying the weather before Winter, and she had her hair in a bun, very similar to how her mother used to dress.

She was laughing at something Rose said(and her laugh was also very similar to her mother's) when they met, but she caught the tail end of their conversation.

"And she was just there with him, with that gloating bitch face of hers, holding him like a trophy, how can he be so stupid, Nev?"

Professor Longbottom had a long-suffering look on his face as if he had heard that story a lot. With closed eyes, he gently guided her out of the store, and spoke, as if repeating a mantra.

"They are /married,/ Hermione, have been for more than a decade now, it's kind of what marri-"

He stopped speaking when Hermione stopped abruptly, he opened his eyes and looked at the three students in front of them, specifically at the student in the middle, and couldn't stop himself from muttering 'shite' under his breath.

For the first time, Lilian was actually scared, Professor Granger looked at her with hatred, and at the moment it was like she was seeing someone else instead of Lilian, she had a pretty good idea who. There was actually a breeze as Professor Granger's magic flared.

The Professor sneered, and then almost /snarled/, "Green-"

"Miss /Potter/! Miss Weasley and Mr. Malfoy." Professor Longbottom almost screamed the first name while placing a hand on Professor Granger's shoulder and guiding her to the side, and /away/ from Lilian.

"A fine day to you three, don't forget about the essay, it's due Monday, and no extensions!"

As Lilian saw then leaving with wide eyes, seeing Professor Longbottom start whispering with a grave expression, while Professor Granger placed her hands in her face.

"Shite, Lils! I thought she was gonna curse you!"

"Me too, she looked really mad, some people give me ugly looks here too, but not like /that/!"

Lilian turned to look at Scorpius, who actually had a hand on this wand, and was too following the Professors with his eyes.

Rose was looking shocked.

"Did you hear that? She almost called you Greengrass, your mother's maiden name!"

Scorpius turned to look at her, and his eyes widened, "Lils, are you okay? You-you are crying."

Rose hugged her as she sniffed, and Scorpius guided them to a more secluded spot until she calmed down.

"She thought I was my mother. Did you feel her magic? She was going to-to attack me!"

"You need to tell McGonagall or your parents, I mean, she can't do that, your father is the Minister of Magic!" Scorpius said.

Rose was nodding, "I will talk to my dad if you want, they are friends too, and I could talk to Aunt Fleur, she is good at talking to people."

"No!" they both were taken aback by her vehemence.

"If we involve them, this is going to become an adult problem, and mother won't let this go, hell, dad might be angry too, even if they were friends, and if I say I felt threatened..."

"Your father will have to go through official channels."

"You won't even need to say it, they will probably ask for a memory."

Lilian nodded, except for her, Professor Granger treated everyone fairly, even Scorpius and some of the children whose parents she fought in the war, and she was a very good teacher.

She knew what to do.

"Guys, I will talk to her."

"What! Are you mad? After that? You still want to be alone with her?"

"She won't attack me! At least, I don't think she will, she was already angry and seeing me..."

Scorpius looked offended, "Hmpf, Mother is right, you Potters are too forgiving, it's not your fault, so you look like your mother, but you are /not/ her."

"I know, and that is what I will say."

"We /will/ be outside, and Rose could call her cousins, just to be safe."

"Louis will be there, Fred too."

Lilian took a deep breath and nodded, she would go there tomorrow, after things had calmed down a bit.
