It was a very diverse group that was walking down the hallways, Potters and Weasleys were already expected, but the Malfoy in there still turned some heads.

Lillian looked at her cousin Scorpius, and her friends, the Weasleys(who were like cousins for her too), they nodded and waited by the corridor's entrance.

Lillian took a deep breath and went through the door of the classroom, walking towards the office, she did her best to not stop.

She reached the door, took a deep breath, and knocked.

There was a moment of silence, what sounded like a muffled crash, and then an "Enter" was heard.

Lilian opened the door cautiously, and couldn't hide her surprise at seeing the office things packed, nor Professor Granger's utterly regretful look when she saw her, she noticed her hair was a bit disheveled, and her eyes had bags under them.

"Ah, Miss Potter, you, good, I wanted to talk to you."

She sounded defeated, very different from the normally assured woman.

"Professor? What, is all this?"

Professor Granger scowled for a moment and then deflated, and gestured at her office, "Well, I am just getting ready for when H-Minister Potter comes here to sack me."

"Sack you? Why would he do that?"

Professor Granger looked at her like she sometimes looked at the kids who asked stupid questions when she thought they weren't looking.

"You really want to rub it in my face, don't you?"

Lilian quickly gathered what she was implying, and went to stop it, "What? No, I didn't tell anything, I don't even think there's anything to tell, I mean, nothing happened, nothing bad."

Hermione looked at her with an open mouth, as if she was seeing her for the first time, she looked into her eyes and when he found truth in them, she deflated, "That's not true, something /did/ happen, I-I..." she sniffed, but pulled the tears back in, a practiced movement, "I almost attacked a student...all because she..." she then collapsed on her chair and began crying.

"I became Snape, oh Merlin, after all that crap I turned out just like Snape...I am a horrible person."

Snape? As in Severus Snape, Professor, Headmaster, and Spy? She vaguely remembered her father telling her about Snape and the grudge they both had with each other, but she thought it was about how her father talked back to everyone when he was a teenager.

She then remembered him talking about how he was friends with her grandmother when they were in school, and then...

Her eyes widened as she saw the parallels. Ironic, indeed.

"Wait, Professor." Lilian didn't know what possessed her to approach the woman and place a hand on her shoulder.

"It's, it's not like that, Dad, he told me a bit about Snape, and you are not like that at all, you don't go after me, you grade my things fairly."

Hermione raised her head to look the girl in the eyes, and her expression softened a lot upon seeing the caring expression on those oh-so-familiar green eyes.

"I am still a bitch to you in class."

Lilian smiled, a soft familiar smile that for Hermione shouldn't look right in that face."Honestly professor I prefer that to people trying to suck up for me because of Dad."

Hermione chuckled and cleaned some tears, "I see, but what I did yesterday..."

"Professor, about that, I /need/ to know, I have been confused since my first year, I figured out it had something to do when you...dated...my dad, but I..."

Hermione looked at her, and the regret came all over again, "Merlin, I really acted like Snape, or at least thought like him..."

She took a deep breath, and indicated the chair, after Lilian sat down she rose from the chair and turned to the window,

"How do you know I won't be biased and tell my version?"

Lilian thought for a moment, "Professor, you were always fair, even after the War when all those people went on trial, and my-...I always heard you had a good sense of justice."

There was a bitter chuckle at that. "A good answer, well, I spent three years being unfair with you because of something that's not your fault, and yesterday...you deserve to know, but....know that people change with time."

Lilian nodded, extremely anxious to hear it.

"When I was in my Sixth Year, with Harry, your father, we...began dating, or rather, seeing each other, it just felt...natural, we had been best friends for years and..." Lilian could hear the pain and nostalgia in her voice.

"We did that for a few months, with the War and everything, things were pretty hectic, and then Seventh Year started and we couldn't go back to Hogwarts, it was dangerous, and we had something...important to do, Harry, Ron-That is Mr. Weasley, Ronald, and Me, so we left, just us three, to do that."

Lilian remembered her father talking about that, not going to school and an important mission, given by Albus Dumbledore himself, but he never gave details, and she felt it wasn't her place to ask.

"That year, a lot of bad things happened, and it ended in the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry won, we won, but we had grown apart somewhat, the war and the things were...we did things we aren't proud of, things we regret to this day."

"After the war, lots of things, happened, the trials, and the reconstruction, but we still met, Harry and me, and then I had to leave the country for a time to...look for some people, Harry had to stay, there were things only could do."

The silence was such Lilian could hear the tears hitting the floor.

"That's when...That's when your m-mother, /approached/ him, I think, I /know/ they were just business partners and friends first, they had never been in contact during Hogwarts, what with that stupid Gryffindor versus Slytherin thing, but after the war, things were /easier."/

Lilian remembered her parents talking about that, they met on a business lunch, through Andromeda Tonks, Dad's lawyer, and family friend, even to this day, and her mother started helping to deal with the Potter and Black states, who even with the war were substantial, her father had no idea how to manage companies and properties and was /terrified/ of squandering his family's legacy.

Her mother had been trained from birth to manage companies, to be the heiress to the family, and so she was able to help him, after Andromeda vouched for her, apparently, others who her mother had helped avoid punishment in the seventh year vouched for her and Aunt Astoria too. They became friends, and then lovers, apparently they went into a cruise or something.

"When I came back, everything was so different, Harry was different, very different, we tried to approach, but, he had become a different person, he wanted different things, politics, and I knew, I /thought/, it was your m-mother's doing, that she had turned the boy I knew into a...politician, a Lord of the Wizengamot," the disdain in her voice was unmistakable, as was the undercurrent of anger at the next ones, "that she had turned him away from me."

Lilian thought about how little she knew of that time, her father had told about other girlfriends, but never expanded upon it, and he had said he changed a lot after the war, became more thoughtful, how he learned to see the opportunities he had to help people, to use his fame for good instead of just 'getting lambasted by reporters', heck there was even a book about his 'rise',' Harry Potter: From Warrior to Lawmaker.', had her mother done that?

"And I was right, your m-mother, D-Daphne Greengrass /changed/ Harry! He didn't want to play Quidditch professionally anymore, or be an Auror to be an Auror, he wanted to become an Auror, then Head of the Department for Magical Law Enforcement, and then /Minister./"

It was exactly what had happened in a little more than a decade.
