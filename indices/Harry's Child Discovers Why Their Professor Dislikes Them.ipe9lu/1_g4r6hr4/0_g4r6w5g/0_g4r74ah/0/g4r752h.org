But Lilian never saw her father as a politician, he had real friends, and kept the people he disliked at a business distance or at the most a cordial relationship. She could see he was truly passionate about the things he did, and he wasn't cold /at/ /all,/ her mother had even told her was just 'too honest' with people to be a politician, but she said that with a fond, almost silly smile.

"The Harry I knew and /loved/, wasn't like that, the way he talked, like a politician, and then he...ended things, officially I guess, it was already over months before, I didn't take it well, and confronted Greengrass, and she...well...looking back I am going to say we were both giant bitches that day, she showed me a ring, it had been a gift from what I know now, but I thought other things, and she /gloated/, and I...well I talked back, we began screaming and then spells started flying."

Lilian couldn't imagine her mother /gloating/, but she had said her teenage self wasn't very pleasant in some situations.

Hermione gave a bitter chuckle, "It was a mess, we destroyed the living room and some of the walls of Grimmauld Place, some of the wards even fell, we were really going to hurt each other when Harry appeared, he disarmed us, with that fancy Wand of his."

Lilian, for some reason, immediately remembered her father's notched Wand, that he always had on himself and that she never liked picking up, he also used a darker one, to teach her magic or do some fun spells, that one was much more friendly and shared the same wood as her own wand, Holly.

"We shouted and said things we shouldn't, I found out he thought I had done some things I...hadn't, not in the way he imagined them, and I think that was the day we..." she sniffed.

"And since then, me and..." she looked at Lilian, for a moment looking surprised she was there, "your /mother/, never saw eye to eye, some other things happened over the years, but they all stem from that, and I never could get past it, I couldn't look at you without seeing your mother and, Merlin how I am a stupid little girl. I am so sorry."

Hermione seated back and was now looking up with a miserable expression.

Lilian thought a sensible teenager would just thank her and leaver he quietly with some platitudes.

But she was Lilian Luna /Potter/, daughter of Harry James Potter, and so she wasn't that sensible. She was also the daughter of Daphne Ophelia Potter so she knew how to be diplomatic. She was also a girl, which already helped a lot to understand Professor Granger's situation.

"Professor, I, I understand, thank you for telling me."

Hermione just nodded, probably expecting the girl the leave.

"But I think it's mighty stupid you are leaving because of that."

Hermione looked at her, and for a moment she again looked like she was seeing another person.

"What?"

"Look, I know it's not my place, because I am thirteen and a child and I don't understand all that happened and that my dating experience limits itself to having kissed Frank Longbottom in the Chamber of Secrets." she immediately closed her mouth with her hands. "I shouldn't have said that, I should /not/ have said that."

"Anyway...I think you are a great teacher, easily one of the best, and everyone loves you, I mean some of the boys are, /eww,/ but, look, you were just distressed and I can see that and yes, it scared the crap out of me, but I won't tell if you don't and those that were there won't too, I also think you are justified in being mad at my mum to some capacity, but it has been fifteen years and, dad always looks sad when he talks about you, and mother, well I know you won't care but it's one of the few times she looks very remorseful." she took a deep breath.

"So I think you should stay, and...and maybe talk with my parents, I don't know how you adults act, but I can see everyone is having a bad time with this, even if it's just to clear the air, I think you should do it," she said, in a half smile, but with a defiant look on her face.

Hermione was now looking at her, and she had an extremely wistful look on her face, Lilian had the distinct impression she was seeing her with a different color of hair.

"Miss Potter."

"Lilian, I mean, call me Lilian, Professor, you just shared something so personal with me, it feels wrong to call me Miss Potter."

Hermione huffed good-naturedly.

"Fine, Lilian, I am really, really sorry, about how I treated you, it was very, very wrong of me, it /won't/ happen again and I...thank you for not, reporting me," she chuckled, "I think I am long overdue a talk with...your parents."

They smiled at each other, and Lilian felt she had done something good, now she would have to work on the other end, because she thought her mother had a grudge too, just well hidden.

"Well then, Professor Granger, I think you should unpack, and I will be going..."

"Miss Potter, or Lilian, in private, I guess, thank you for that, speaking about it was almost like...well it was good, and sorry again."

"It's okay Professor, it's not like you used rapid-fire questions to try to embarrass me on the first day of class."

Hermione snorted and Lilian turned to leave.

"And Lilian, I will forget I ever heard anything about you in the Chamber of Secrets, if you agree on working with me and Professor Hagrid on showing how speaking Parseltongue is just a regular magical ability with nothing evil involved...it was something I...always wanted to do."

Lilian gasped, and then turned back to look at her with a smile, "Okay, Professor, if you wait until next year we can have two parselmouths in school, and on some special days we may get three."

And then she left an openmouthed Hermione in there, her things unpacking around her, and walked down the corridor, where she could see her friends looking shocked as she smiled at them.

Leave for her to solve a fifteen-year-old family feud, she truly was a Potter.

NOTE: I started writing for something but then it turned completely different because I guess I just can't bash, sorry.

This would also ask for a conclusion. What truly happened? Was Hermione's version completely correct? Did she omit stuff to spare Lilian? Did Daphne do something more untoward, or was it all just a big misunderstanding that turned into anger and resentment with time and continued enmity?

Did they reconcile and rebuild their friendship? Did they reconcile, and Hermione married Harry and Daphne, to the utter embarrassment of Lilian and James, also making Minerva win a long time bet with Filius?

I don't know.
