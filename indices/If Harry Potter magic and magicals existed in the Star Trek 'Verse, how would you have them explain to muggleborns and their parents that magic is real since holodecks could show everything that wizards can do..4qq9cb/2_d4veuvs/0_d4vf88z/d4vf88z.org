Yes, magicals call it octarine, muggles call it orthogonal radiation and it's linked to some areas of earth where the mythical ley lines converge. Orthogonal radiation does not play well with solid state crystal based tech. Orthogonal radiation does not play well with genetic engineering/testing in the story either.

Magical but they're beginning to study alien cultures in hopes of findi more magicals and studying those psionic abilities of others but find vulcans and betazoids don't produce octarine like they do.
