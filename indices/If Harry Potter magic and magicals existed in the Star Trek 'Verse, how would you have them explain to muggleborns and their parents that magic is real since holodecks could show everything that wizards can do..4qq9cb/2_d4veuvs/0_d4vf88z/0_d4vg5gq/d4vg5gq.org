I guess then it rather depends on how much the wizards actually know this. If they do magic by instinct and ritual, their approach would be 'careful and cautious'.

Ensigns Gary and Udotra Harcourt were sitting down for a dinner with their daughter Madeline when someone literally 'knocked' on the door to their quarters.

Udotra was closer, so she stood from the table and called 'enter', prompting a yelp of surprise and delight from their visitor- a rather strangely-dressed human from the planet below. He entered, turning in place to watch the doors close again before turning back to the family.

"Oh, hello! Some lovely automation you have. Allow me to introduce myself; I'm Professor Aristotle Brambleditch."

Gary stood as well and tapped his communicator. "Intruder alert on deck twelve." Strangely, no response came from his badge nor from the computer panel.

"Now, now. I wouldn't want us to be interrupted. It's just that we've a certain talent for... eh... 'bending the rules' of reality and we keep an eye out for others with that potential. Our devices noticed that your daughter is one. Like us. As the timing is right, I've come to offer her a place with us, to learn how to do what we do. It's really the responsible thing to do. Oh- is that Chicken Marsala? I love a good wine sauce." The professor pulled a stick of wood from the layers of robes and a moment later an entire place setting with a full plate of the same food was arranged for him.

"Sir, I am going to have to ask you to leave!"

"Really? That's unfortunate. I was looking forward to a lovely conversation."

The man then disappeared with a 'pop'. Left behind in his wake was a hand-written letter on parchment, addressed to their daughter.
