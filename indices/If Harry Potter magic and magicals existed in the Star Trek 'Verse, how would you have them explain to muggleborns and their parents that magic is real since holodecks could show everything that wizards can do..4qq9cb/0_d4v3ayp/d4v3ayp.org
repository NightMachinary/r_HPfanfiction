They would probably treat it like the Batazoids. Deanna Troi's abilities might as well be magic to us, but the canon has some techno-babble that explains it away.

The Wizarding world is it's own separate culture but it does keep pace in some fashion with muggle advancements. The Ministry has Cars and so forth. I figure by the time that ST is set they would explain things to muggleborns through a "sciency" perspective. They would explain that Wizards can ignore most of known physics with the use of a (perhaps definable) power(energy) they call magic. They use instruments that resonate with the same or similar energy to focus this ability.

It wouldn't be treated as /magical/, but a rather rare trait that needs to be trained.
