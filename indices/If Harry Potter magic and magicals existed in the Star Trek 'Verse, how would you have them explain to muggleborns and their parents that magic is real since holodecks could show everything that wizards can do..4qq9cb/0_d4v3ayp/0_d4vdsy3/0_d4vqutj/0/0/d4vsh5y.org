  When Harry Potter is rescued from a planet he spent centuries on alone, he's happy to find his kind still exist on their new world but he exiles himself amongst the muggles of the Federation, hunting for something. Then when his one friend amongst them is murdered, Harry contacts the one group that knows of his abilities and offers his help. For a price.
