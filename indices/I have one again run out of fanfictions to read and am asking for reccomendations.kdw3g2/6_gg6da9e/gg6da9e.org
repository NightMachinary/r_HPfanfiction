on FF -- "Matchmaking for Marauders" by Earnest Hedwingway

this uses Marauders era political tension in hogwarts as a not so veiled allegory for facing racism, and Lily is putting to head some big plans. seems like slowburn JILY but i really like the way the tension is written. it's still being written but excited for updates.
