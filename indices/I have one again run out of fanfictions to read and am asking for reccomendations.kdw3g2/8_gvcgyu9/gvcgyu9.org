For the Wrong-boy-who-lived genre I'd recommend: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man) linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes) linkao3(Harry Potter and the Forsaken's Ascension by ACI100) All of then are still updating. The author for Den of Snakes, which is part of the Sarcasm & Slytherin series abandoned their account halfway through the fifth book and continued the series under the username anonymousmagpie. Forsaken's Ascension is part of the Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos series. All three of these series' are still updating.

Each of them are different, but the general premise is that Harry's twin is the boy-who-lived, raised by James and/or Lily, while Harry was abandoned to the Dursley's for being a squib. Even though he isn't a squib. There's no extreme exaggeration, and any bashing is well earned.

[[http://redhen-publications.com/files_to_post/publications/Pimpernel-lowRes.pdf]] is the link for The Scarlet Pimpernel. The most highly recommended Percy-centric fic set when the ministry is taken over by Death Eaters. A BAMF Percy helped the muggleborns escape. Completed.

linkffn(Unseen Perspective by TendraelUmbra) linkao3(Unseen Perspective by Tendrael) The Fanfiction.net and AO3 links for the same fic. Voldemort is a woman and she isn't a blood purist. Her goals haven't been revealed though. The beginning is in the graveyard at the end of Goblet of Fire. Delphi Riddle is also a character in this. Voldemort is OP and cringeworthy. Still updating.

linkffn(A Joke Gone Wrong by Atana) The start of a series by the same author where Dumbledore is a father figure to Snape. Marauders bashing. Set right after the prank where Snape runs into the forest to attempt suicide. By the last book, Snape joins the Death Eaters with the purpose of spying on them for Dumbledore.

Linkffn(The Well Groomed Mind by Lady Khali) Possibly the best Manipulative!Dumbledore fic that exists. I am not the only one who thinks that. Sadly, it's abandoned. But it's abandoned partway through the second book so you can still read the first one if you don't like reading abandoned fics. The summary doesn't say a lot. Basically, Harry's whole reckless, Gryffindor, rushing into danger before thinking personality doesn't exist. Dumbledore essentially mind-raped Harry with Legilimency to create this false personality so he could use Harry as a weapon for a prophecy that doesn't exist. Barty Crouch Jr also teaches Harry occlumeny and is a main character through the books.
