  Platonia is the name for a hypothetic entity of a timeless realm containing every possible "Now" of the universe. The physical world is not as real as timeless, absolute, unchangeable ideas. But change is a constant factor in life. Tom Riddle doesn't like change he can't control.  „Tom.“, he didn't look up from the books that were laid out before him. The mean gleam in her eyes deepened and her smile turned predatory. She felt like the tigress stalking her prey, but she knew it wasn't like that. He only let her be the tigress, because in reality he was the most beautiful predator she had ever seen. And she wanted him to be hers.  Tags and Summary may change as story progresses
