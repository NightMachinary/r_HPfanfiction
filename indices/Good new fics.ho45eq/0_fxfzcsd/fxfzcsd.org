linkffn(The Imposter Complex) is a fantastic read and updating.

linkffn(Subversion by Myricle) is dormant but excellent.

If you ever read Alexandra Quick, the fifth book in that series was posted last year after a seven-year hiatus. Highly recommend both it and the series at large.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) was definitely a thing when you were last around but has really taken off and become incredibly popular in the last year.
