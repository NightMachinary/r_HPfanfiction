*That Universe Over There* - linkao3(23702959)\\
Harry touched something in the DoM he wasn't supposed to and finds himself on top of a certain school. He notices a little girl there with him. Yoink. Spoilers: That girl is that universe's analogue of him.

Harry is the MoD, forced to take up the Peverell Lordship, has a vault filled with money, and the Goblins /want/ to help him. But does he use this? Hell no, he's anti-social, and the Goblins grin all the time which frankly scares him.

Ivy (Fem!Harry) is an experience of itself. She's like Fred&George, the Marauders, Hagrid, Charlie, Bill, and Hufflepuff rendered down into one person. And dosed with cocaine. She turns Hogwarts on its head. And may or may not have a Hufflepuff Army.

*Reading the Books* ([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1779118][series link]])\\
*Reading the books - Sorcerer's Stone* (first entry) - linkao3(24609685)\\
Stereotypical "the cast reads the books" series. Except this one is currently in Year4 and updates fairly regularly. The reactions are both realistic and hilarious. Things are happening because of the book reading. Fudge is starting to find his brain. Sirius was exonerated. And Harry has a new girlfriend.
