linkffn(Protection: The Sword and the Shield) is a really good use of both tropes and the author's imagination. Lots of lemons and basically a harem protag Harry Potter.

linkffn(The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries) has a bit of an abrupt start but is utterly amazing incorporating so much magic and mythology and character/world building in a way that is such a page turner.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Potter Grimoire) is a story where Harry gets the Potter Grimoire from Sirius. Unique and interesting family magic is a large part of this story.
