Legacy has this and is really good so far.

In it all the founders are going to be reborn, though so far it's just Salazar and Godric as Harry and Cedric. Cedric is currently a first year, but Harry left the Dursleys and is living at Hogwarts.

Unfortunately however, the author seems to have gone down the path for starting a bunch of new fics when they already had several in progress ones, so updates aren't too frequent, and in my experience that usually leads to most of an authors fics getting abandoned. I like their Pokemon fic To Be A Master a lot though, and another of their HP fics, Strange Visitors From Another Century.
