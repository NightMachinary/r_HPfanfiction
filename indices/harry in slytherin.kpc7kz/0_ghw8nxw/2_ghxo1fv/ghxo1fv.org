Don't make Harry be the only cunning person in Hogwarts. It's fine if you have Draco, for example, to be this brash child he is in canon since you can easily excuse his behavior on his upbringing, but don't make the rest of the House a bunch of sheep that follow him [Draco] around because of Lucius, or even worse, have them follow Harry (11-year old child) just because he is the main character.

Don't make Harry the heir of Slytherin the moment he enters the common room, don't make the entire house to be a bunch of bullies that curse him all the time because he is a Potter, don't use those overused tropes such as 'what happens in the common room stays in the common room' or 'the underground arena where they can fight if someone insults someone' and so on.

Don't have Harry to win over the entire Slytherin simply because he is the MC. Let him work for it, and struggle because of his blood, upbringing, and lack of magical family. You could consider Harry using parseltongue to gain some respect. For example, let him struggle in the first year, since he's new to the whole magic thing, has no connections, and he's a half-blood, which would change when he speaks to the snake, whether it is in the dueling club (second year), or you could devise a completely new scenario where this ability would manifest itself. I think the former idea would be more dramatic since the entire school would think ill of him, and the only ones who didn't think about him as evil would be Slytherins, who made his life difficult until now.

You could take a page from the Santi's 'Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived', and have someone to stick with him, only for him to learn that the entire reason for them being friendly was to milk his name and his fame and to manipulate him, only for them to end up liking each other for real, or maybe have Harry find out about this which could start some hostile rivalry between them.

And probably the most important of all, don't make 11-years old children be politicians.
