Figure out what the characters motivation is (they should be ambitious and be trying to become powerful to achieve their goals). Have a diverse selection of goals and incorporate a couple into the plot that your Harry is focused on. For example, your Harry is attending lots of pureblood parties to become a politician, Pansy wants to become an influential robes designer so she shows him what to wear and proves that she's the best in that way, Blaise has been taught by his mother all about manipulation so that he can take on the Italian wizarding world so he has no qualms about helping Harry in England and might make a strong ally (Or develop the other characters more; Theo wants to start his own business “Nott Products” and he will go to any length to get situated, Tracey's kids will get pureblood status if she marries well so she is learning as much as she can to be the best mother beyond the typical “just give birth”) Draco being the more direct competition makes the most sense so you just need to allow him a share of the wins, especially at the start of the story. Some people over power Harry by letting him do things that society advises against so there should be consequences for this that he doesn't see coming (which Draco can know about). Canon Draco loses at the start of PS cause he represents Harry coming out of the shadow of the Dursley's, meanwhile Quirrell is getting a lot of wins in the background, so pick your main opponent and give them some early intimidating wins. Introduce a plot goal that is stakes enough to be contentious but won't wipe the enemy out (this is the Quidditch games in canon) eg a special assignment. Give your Harry flaws and let the other characters recognise them and exploit them, then you can have Harry overcome his flaw at the end (not at the beginning or the story is boring).
