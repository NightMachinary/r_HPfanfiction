you could always incorporate some of the older slytherins, which I find are an untapped resource in fics with a slytherin main character. one of those options is an OC sibling of a known pureblood family, example being Josephine Zabini, from the AO3 fic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11745900/chapters/26470377][Rose Petal Red]], which i realize as a self insert isn't for everybody, but i enjoy it a lot.

alternatively, you could use known characters, but switch up their motivations a bit. Draco is usually portrayed as a fairly 2D character, especially in the beginning of most fics. However, you change his overwhelming arrogance and reliance on his father's name to a arrogance on the Malfoy name and a need to live up to his father's harsher expectations that he live up to slytherin ideals and suddenly he feels a lot more real and complex. Or, Daphne Greengrass, who i think is rarely seen as a rival, and more often as a ally/love interest. In a fic she could be portrayed by her family's neutrality during the war to appeal to halfbloods and minor purebloods, as an alternative to the more supremacist purebloods in slytherin. I think it depends on what you're willing to change or create about a character's motivations
