I do hope you don't allow some of the negativity that you receive to get to you. I am all for promoting your own work. Regardless of if I enjoy your work or not, I think it is important that we as a community, encourage more material. I just hope those lurkers who have considered writing do not also get discouraged. Everyone has a niche they enjoy, some may not like yours but clearly many people do.
