I just don't understand why it matters to you. Hell, we are apart of a dying fandom. I'll happily support any writer who can piece together a coherent story with plot. There is nothing wrong with promotion of their fic and I believe comments such as yours can go a long way to dissuading writers that may just lurk around here. We should be encouraging new material, not bashing on the author. This is a fantastic community and I would like to keep it that way.
