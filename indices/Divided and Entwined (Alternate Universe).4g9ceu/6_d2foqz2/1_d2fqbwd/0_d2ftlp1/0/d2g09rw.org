I actually like that, and people don't seem to care so much when I recommend one story in five different request threads because it's related or fits in them all. While I'm not the author, how do you guys /know/ that? There's really not much of a difference between me promoting the same story five times and someone else doing it with their own, except some strange idea that authors shouldn't rec their own things (which I do see elsewhere as well).

I had seen Patron recommended or posted a few times, and it finally made it onto my follow list when it was posted in a request thread that I was actually interested in.
