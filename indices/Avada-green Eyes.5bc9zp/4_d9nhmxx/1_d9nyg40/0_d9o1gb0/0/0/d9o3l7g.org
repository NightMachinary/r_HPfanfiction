No, No, No. The eyes are because of his maternal ancestor Merlin. Who also was the last dragon shifter (And also the last elven king). The girls all get horny because he has the inheritance from his paternal ancestor count Dracula who was a Veela and Vampire hybrid. He also can morph into a basilisk, due to the Slytherin blood he has, because he is his magical heir. He is also the leader of all the magical creatures because he yelled at a goblin instinctively. And that is how it is!! (Pardon me, if I have spelling mistakes. I don't speak English natively.)
