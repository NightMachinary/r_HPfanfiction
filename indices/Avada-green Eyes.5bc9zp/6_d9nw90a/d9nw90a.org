I feel like in some of the edgier fics his eyes are like that because of "magic residue" or something remaining from the actual curse that was cast that Halloween. And to be honest, in a world where magic even exists, surviving an Avada Kedavra directly to the face might leave some lasting effects. A Harry with green eyes the shade of the Killing Curse makes enough sense to not break suspension of disbelief if thought of like this.
