“Madam” isn't really anything special, it's just a word you use when you use someone's surname to refer to them and you want to be polite or at least pretend to be polite. It's pretty much the female equivalent of “Sir”.

So yeah, I can see Shacklebolt using that word when talking to her even if she is a nasty crone.
