[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13255607/1/A-Mentor-s-Burden][In which Tom Riddle becomes Dumbledore's biggest and most devoted fan.]] -- Naidhe's A Mentor's Burden.

For Delphi... there's this fanfic where Delphi is using time travel to fix the plot of a CC or something. It takes her a bunch of attempts and there's a log of them. I can't remember what it's called, though. I'll see if I can find it, I first came across it on this sub, iirc.

EDIT: Bad Oracle. I'm not actually sure if I've read the main fic or not (and consequently if it's a humour fic), but the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16134098][log is what you're looking for/]]
