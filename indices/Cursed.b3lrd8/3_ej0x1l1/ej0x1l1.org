Curses to drive someone slowly insane:

to only ever hear your name slightly mispronounced in the mouths of others

to perceive all objects slightly to the left of where they actually are

to constantly have the sensation of someone looking at you

to believe yourself a legilimens and nobody thinks well of you

to be unable to hear the word 'the' in ordinary conversation

to be unable to hear alarm clocks or anything that chimes the hour

Oh, and the entrails expelling curse? Started out as the Undoing Charm, with which a wizard out hunting can dress a carcass and sort and stack the offal and umbles with a single spell. It becomes the entrails-expelling curse if you use it on a live opponent in a fight and power it with malice (hatred, aggression, reactive fear, emotions like that there).
