Hermione bit her lip, "Harry, are you sure this is a good idea?"

Harry swivelled his head to give her a strange look. "Hermione, it's Snape's birthday! Even if he doesn't like students, I can't imagine him being mad for us getting him a cake."

Hermione opened her mouth as several emotions passed on her face before closing her mouth without saying a word. The two continued their abrupt journe.y Little did they know they were about to be the second person to bring Snape cake that day.

The first was Luna Lovegood.
