Definitely! This fic is amazing and I live in hope that one day the author will update. Until author says "discontinued" and not "on hiatus", I'm just gonna keep my fingers crossed for a new chapter.

That story is soooo original and awesome!!! I LOVED the thread magic and the stuff about parseltongue (the fangs and poison). It was so cool to see a different aspect to it! The fic really went all out for originality! And I adored how the author utilized House Black!

And you're totally right about the romance between fem!Harry and Voldemort not feeling rushed/weird or Stockholm syndrome-y.

Ugh, such an amazing story! I'm off to go re-read lol.
