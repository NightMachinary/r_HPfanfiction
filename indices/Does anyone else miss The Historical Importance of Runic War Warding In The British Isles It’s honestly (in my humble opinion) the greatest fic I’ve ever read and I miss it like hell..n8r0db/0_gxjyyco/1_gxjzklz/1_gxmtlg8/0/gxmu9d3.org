I did mention that there were accusations indeed.

I've read both Ichor and Samvelg's work and really I haven't seen a single resemblance in the writing or /allegedly/ stolen lines but it was my own vision I guess. Honestly even the lines that were paralleled in the thread were not THAT similar especially since given both contexts of them. In Ichor it was more about Voldemort's jealousy of the loyalty/love/home feelings that Harrie had over her loved ones whereas she hated Voldemort and rejected him for VERY valid reasons. In samvelg's I felt like it was Harry's acceptance of him and their souls "rejoicing" in her for lack of better terms.

Honestly idk how to feel about it.
