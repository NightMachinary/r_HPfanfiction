Yeah I know about the whole morale crusade thing to save bloodlines and the world was not everyone's vison but again that's what fanfics are for, I mean there comes a time where you need to bend canon in order to move along the story to your vision because that's fictional. Also it has been so long since I've read the actual HP canon that for exemple I didn't even remember the fact that he has wiped out houses before you mentioned it again lol. God I really need to catch up again with what actually happened in canon.

Yeah that's why I said it's not everyone's cup of tea, just like Ichor's was to many extents. Many people were calling it over-angsty and a hard to read (which I agree, not many fics have made me cry but she did). I loved it and especially all her original characters (idk if you remember but he had this counselor/friend/sidekick whatever you want called Samson and he was my favorite thing in the whole world but again canon!voldemort worked alone and was lonely as hell), she was a very good writer and all her metaphors to religions and mythology were delicious so I kept going through it but it was the saddest, heaviest thing I've ever read honestly my heart broke for Harrie.

Then there was the issue that he was an overly sexual person and people were complaining because they always saw him as asexual, (which was not once mentioned in the book so total fanon) like guys do you all know that fanfics are made to create your own story based on someone's else story so you can totally incorporate your own stuff??? Like why read fiction if you want an almost carbon-copy of canon.
