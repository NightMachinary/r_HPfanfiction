Canon!Voldemort was a /sick/ bastard who revelled in his own inhumanity. Historic Warding justifies that as some kind of daytime mask. Then you have Voldemort just being a handsome cool dude lounging in the library and feeling out 16-year olds at night. The dissonance kinda creeps up on you especially given that the fic is post-OOTP canon divergence without any explanations for Voldemort's partial sanity.
