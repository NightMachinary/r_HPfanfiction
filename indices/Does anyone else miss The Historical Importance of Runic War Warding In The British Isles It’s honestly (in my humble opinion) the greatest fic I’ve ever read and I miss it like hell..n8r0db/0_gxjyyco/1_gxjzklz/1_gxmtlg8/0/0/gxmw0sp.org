The fic itself has some good worldbuilding, FemHarry is sweet and the relationship is handled somewhat well. But the whole fic simply feels /slimy/, for lack of better terms what with all the Voldemort-Apologism. So many of Voldemort's arguments break down at the slightest scrutiny and Harry just goes along with them. All of his past atrocities seem to be kept out of mind. The entire "preserving noble houses" doesn't make much sense when Voldemort personally wiped out so many of them.
