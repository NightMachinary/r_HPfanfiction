Maybe that's the point! Harry in this fic is apparently just an extension of Voldemort's soul, so naturally he will be able to influence her mind into trusting him. That's not how it is really written, but one can always assume a heavy dose of Unreliable Narrator. She never wonders if her thoughts are her own, which is very suspect. Marrying a puppet version of himself with the proper body parts sounds exactly like Voldemort. One can always wish...

I also dislike how Dumbledore is handled in this one. Yes, he kept a large secret which would have been of very little use to her except to increase her misery. At no point does she actually consider /talking/ with Dumbledore to get the other side's version. Then again, she is a puppet..
