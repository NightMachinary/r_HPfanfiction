Yeah, I totally could actually see that reasoning working way better than what was written. at least that would make harrys trust and 'like' of voldemort more plausible.

I honestly do not understand the need to vilify dumbledore, and the fact that Snape does it as well? What? What? Harry spends more time simping for voldemort than she does considering the things he's done. She pays it lip service in the first few chapters... but that's it. and it's weak at best.

And don't get me started on the whole narcissa/snape buddy/wine mom relationship that was going on there... that made no sense.

Like you said, so much of this story falls apart with any critical thought. But people like it because it's easy and all the 'problems' of the characters are swept away. (or just blamed all on dumbledore. becuase yeah, he's totally to blame for voldemort choosing homicide and genocide... ðŸ‘Œ)
