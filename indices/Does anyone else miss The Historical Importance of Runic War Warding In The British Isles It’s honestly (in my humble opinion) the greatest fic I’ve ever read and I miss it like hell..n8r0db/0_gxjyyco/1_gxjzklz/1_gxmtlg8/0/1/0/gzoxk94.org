Wow I had only seen the thread in Ichor, I had no idea she took so many lines. Apparently there are links available for Bittersweet on the Wayback machine , think I will try to give it a side by side reading to Samvelg's work and try to see any connection one of these days.

As for the ideas being basic I don't really know. Honestly it was the first ever Female Harry work I've ever read which is partly why I've been attached to it for so long. This fic was really soft to read and I feel like Tomarry is made most of the time from very angsty fics.

I think to each their own. Many people will see it as a flawed work or not credible (I respect everyone's opinion) others said it was a pristine work. I am not really sure how overrated would work in fanfics considering it is simply people leaving kudos/comments so it's kind of hard to judge.
