Nocturnememory is back on ao3 qith other work and on wordpress for ichor, I think you'll only find really old stuff on the wayback machine if you even can.

I honestly believe that's its different strokes for different folks and all that, but people who like historical importance act like it's this wholly original entity, and its really....not. which is cool, that's what fanfiction is, it's like this perpetual cycle of ideas and concepts and what not. But a big part of that is reading and participating in fandom. Most authors, a lot of authors will talk about their inspiration. Nocturnememory did. Cybrid did. Obsidianpen did. Off the top of my head. Authors who only mention their ' inspiration ' after being called out....kinda sus.

But yeah, anyway, I can see how and why people enjoy the fic. Its easy, theres not a lot of critical thinking involved in you know, the handling of some of the core concepts and beliefs that /should/be part of the death eaters and Voldemort. I mean, they're literally murderers and racists...theres not a lot of wiggle room for what they represent. And yeah, fanfic is about changing things....but everything in canon still happened up until fifth year in this fic. Wars still happened. People still died. The death eaters literally killed and tortured and hate people. Hermione is still a muggle born and still Harry's supposed best friend. But...you know, voldemort's Harry's sugar daddy so it's cool? I'm mostly kidding, I'm sorry... like I said, I can see why it could be fun. I just dont think it deserves the title of being this massively unique original flawless work.
