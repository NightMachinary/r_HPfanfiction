Samvelg literally had multiple lines taken from ichor, and one whole conversation that was verbatim from one of nocturnememory's other stories, it wasn't even from ichor, but it was literally word or word.\\
Samvelg also took a lot of stuff ellory and another author and didn't credit anything until nocturnememory called her out for all of it.

I don't think borrowing ideas is a terrible thing, but being honest about things is the right thing to do, especially when everyone is doing this for free and for fun.

There is literally nothing original in Historical importance, it's all stuff that's been around for ages. Every cliche and trope that's been popular for decades, it's just all in one fic. Blood adoption, roman ties, pureblood culture, voldemort being 'good' the whole gringotts thing. Magic dying. All of it.
