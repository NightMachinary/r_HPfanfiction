Yeah apparently people were not happy with the fact that Voldemort was not canon-ish enough for them. He was apparently too much a man with moral, was a man with trauma/ptsd, too kind, too sweet the list goes on. Which is dumb as hell because I feel like in fanfics people always wants to see him depicted as a inhuman psychopath genocider incapable of love. Like everyone is entitled to their own opinion but that's not entirely who he is, he has many layers is someone incredibly smart and manipulative and I really don't know why people read fanfics and then bitch about the fact that everyone doesn't have the same vision as them.

Also the fact that Harry was indian and bisexual, the many, many accusations of plagiarism... I could go on and on lol. But then again she is not the first nor the last. Itsjustsilver (author of Corruption another Tomarry with female Harry) has been gaslighted so bad for her last chapter, has had such negative reactions over her work, has been accused of plagiarism that she literally never updated Corruption again which is incredibly sad.
