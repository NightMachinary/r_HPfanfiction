She said so many times that this fic will never be abandoned, I even recalls that one time she said she is already working on the sequel, I feel sad for all the controversies she got. Really she is a gifted writer with all these themes going on it would have been so easy to feel into a cringe fest but she handled everything with such an amazing grace.
