YAS, EXACTLY!!!!! I loved the traditions and the backstory author gave for House Black, it was truly imaginative and wonderful. And Sirius! Ah, lovely Sirius!

Wish there were more fics like this! You know, that utilize House Black well like this story did and incorporate unique traditions. Made the magical world more a world of its own, with it's own customs and etiquette.
