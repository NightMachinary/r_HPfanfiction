So, following [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2005/10/24/in-search-of-little-whinging/][this essay]] I have decided for my story that:

1. Little Whinging is a limit approaching [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camberley][Camberley]]. What surprised me, after I decided about that location, that that is where [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Military_Academy_Sandhurst][Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] is located (for you, Americans, that's British equivalent of your West Point). I am surprised nobody used this for anything (neither will I, just that Mr Granger, who is ex-Navy dentist from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Hermes_(R12][HMS Hermes]]), uses Sandhurst as the pick-up place to collect Harry, when he runs from Privet Drive).

2. Grangers live (I picked that up from [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3301733][Northumbrian]]) in the small village of Itchen Worthy which is a limit approaching [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itchen_Valley][Itchen Valley]], an suburb of Winchester.

3. I have no idea about the Aunt Marge, and I cannot care less. According to “[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12551744][Petunia Snaps by Meester Lee]]”, which I like very much, it is in some other London suburb, or certainly not that far from the Little Whinging.
