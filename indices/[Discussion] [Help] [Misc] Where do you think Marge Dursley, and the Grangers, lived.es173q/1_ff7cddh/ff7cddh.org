Personally, I have her in the north of England- she's quite a robust character. Possibly somewhere around York, as there's a lot of context there for county shows and the like which she could show dogs at.

Also she refers to drowning dogs (horrendous) in the books, which is generally a practise associated with rural living and/or farming. She'd therefore be more likely to be from a rural area, and southern England is jam packed.

I like North Yorkshire around Thirsk (a northern aunt Marge and uncle Vernon sounds amazing, and fits as Petunia is from around Manchester), which is about 5 hours from Little Whinging.
