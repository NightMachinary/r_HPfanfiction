Well... Marge only comes on the occasional visit, and when she does she tends to stay for a few days. Her visits are like an event for both Harry and Dudley... Dudley because she dotes on him, Harry because she's the Worst Person Ever. So she has to live far enough away from Little Whinging that going on day trips or just popping by for an afternoon visit wouldn't be practical. So I think we can see with relative certainty that she doesn't live in Surrey, and probably not in London.

Hampstead seems like as good a place for the Grangers as any, but I think you're right that it's mostly used because the exterior shots of the Granger house for the movie were filmed in Hampstead.

You can really place the Grangers anywhere you like in England (except for Little Whinging or Ottery St Catchpole, because if they lived in those places the narrative WOULD have mentioned it) because Hermione's Muggle life is such a non-topic in canon. London is a popular place to put them in fanfic, but just WHERE in London varies wildly.
