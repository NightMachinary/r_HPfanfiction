I think Hampstead fits nicely because it's a really nice, affluent area with a village-y feel despite being bang in the middle of London*. Hampstead is well known for being an extremely expensive area and its high street reflects that to the extent.

It's not, really, really not 'the outskirts of London'. Technically, Greater London is anywhere except the City of London but no-one really thinks of it that way. If you have a look at a London borough map, you can find the outskirt boroughs on the edges of the boundary, e.g., Croydon.

Personally, I think her family seem a bit wealthy for pre-gentrified Croydon. Croydon, like Newham, had a reputation. Although in fairness every borough has wealthy and disadvantaged areas.

If you live in London, anywhere outside of the M25 is the country and anywhere north of Watford the North. It's an ongoing joke.

If you look up UK by population density, then you can see where the fewest people live and can choose how remote you want the country to be. Generally, if you go to the South East or South West of England (basically, not London) it's fairly rural/towny for England barring the odd city. Bearing in mind that England has much higher population than places such as the USA.

Historically, the Shires have been rural.

In my mind, she is either in Devon or Cornwall but of areas I know somewhere in Oxfordshire I think Chipping Norton would fit well as it's a well to do little village in the arse end of nowhere. There's also lots of other tiny villages. But pretty much anywhere in Oxfordshire except Oxford would do.

That said, the UK is much smaller than you think and Marge could feasibly live anywhere, provided she can drive.

My personal theory is that it is much further away that Oxfordshire because she stays in the spare room. Anywhere in Britain would do if you can drive and you can get pretty far by train too. You can get to France and back within the day from Surrey. Edinburgh (Scotland) or Newcastle (almost as far North in England you can go) to London is a bit over 7 hours by car or train.

It can be a bit more tricky travelling from East to West, however.

Edit: In England, the wealthy generally do live in the country.
