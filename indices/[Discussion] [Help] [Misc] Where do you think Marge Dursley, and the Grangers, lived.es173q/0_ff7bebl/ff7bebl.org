For Marge - she gets the train and stays for days at a a time, so you can have her living quite far away if you want. I had her living in Kent which really isn't that far from Surrey but just, to me, fit her Little England aspiring middle class lifestyle. I would suggest any of the home counties too, maybe East Anglia - almost certainly southern.
