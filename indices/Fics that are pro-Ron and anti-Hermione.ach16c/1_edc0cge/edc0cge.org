You know...I can honestly say I've never seen a negative Hermione if Ron isn't also given the death eater treatment.

I suppose the fact that she generally comes across as the only competent member of the group has something to do with it. I mean, I don't even like Hermione, but I still feel the books could have easily been called "Hermione Granger figured that shit out, why are you here scarhead?"
