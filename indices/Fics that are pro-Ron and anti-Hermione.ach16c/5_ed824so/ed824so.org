[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]] (Series) by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mad_fairy/pseuds/mad_fairy][mad_fairy]] During the summer between first and second year Harry prays for help and ends up getting Loki involved in his care. Hermione is bashed (among others) but it's only because it takes a while for her to get used to a more independent Harry. Ron deals with it better but he ends up caught in between Hermione and Harry. I like this because Harry isn't shipped even though some other characters are, and it's complete.
