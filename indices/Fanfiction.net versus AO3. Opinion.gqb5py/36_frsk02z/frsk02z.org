For me, I used to use ffnet exclusively, but then I started moving more and more to ao3 and now I'm always there and only use ffnet for older stories that are still updating.

I might be wrong, but I feel like ao3 has an older average audience, which is good because I think it contributes to ao3 averaging a better quality of fics as well. It also has a higher quantity of slash fics, for which YMMW.

Pros of ao3 far outweight the cons for me, but that might not be the case for everyone. I really like the tagging system, as it makes it much easier to find fics of a certain trope, and especially when they added the "exclude" function, makes it much easier to avoid fics I wouldn't want to read. The only issue with the tagging is that there isn't a "main character" tag, so if I want to read fics in a fandom with a certain main character, and don't care about the pairing, there's no way to do that. The other issue (which I don't find problematic as I don't have those types of ships) is if you want to read a fic about a popular side pairing in a fandom. (I guess a good example would be Ron/Hermione maybe? You want to read a fic about them, but there are /so/ many fics with Harry and his pairing as central to the fic, with them being just the side pairing, so you can't find the fics you want in the flood of all the others). While on ffnet if you search for a certain pairing, the fics you find will definitely be about that pairing, so that's one plus for that at least.

One other thing that /super/ annoys me about ffnet are the ads. I usually read fanfiction on my phone, so I don't have an adblocker, and they've recently started putting ads smack dab in the middle of the text which is insane.
