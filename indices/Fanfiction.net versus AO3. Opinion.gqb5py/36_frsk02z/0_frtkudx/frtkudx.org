This is an awesome comment, thank you! I've exclusively used ao3, so it's always nice to see the opinion of someone who has seen both sides.

I find that the quality of fics on ao3 is very high, especially compared to when I was reading on wattpad. ... yeah. I can't say much for ff.net because I've only read a few things there, but I'll definitely start considering the general fic quality because I'm curious.

The tagging system is great, I was just saying this is another comment. I love specific tropes, and the tags allow me to search for these purely dependent on what I'm wanting that day. Although some writers neglect tagging, I can still almost always find great content for what is tagged correctly.

I completely agree with the pairing filtering. In other fandoms I enjoy some rare pairs, and it becomes extremely difficult to find these among other fics, as often they're just a side ship and not the focus, meaning that I end up with thousands of fics that I'm not looking for. The exclude feature does help this, but often the fics I want still do have tags for popular ships, and then I lose anything there. Often I end up looking through masterlists/suggestions instead.

The ads is... odd, honestly. With competition between the two sites, I would've thought they'd try to keep the readers as happy as possible, and ads certainly won't do that. Does anyone know if the organisers are payed, or are they volunteers like on ao3? Ao3 holds periods where they ask for donations (to support the website, not to pay them) and they usually exceed their goal before the deadline, so I'm surprised that ff.net doesn't resort to something similar and rid the ads.
