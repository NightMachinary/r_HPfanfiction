I really like this reply! This essentially summed up exactly why I enjoy ao3. Entire work is great, both for reading all at once and finding names, etc. I love the bookmarks feature as I've found so many great fics because of it!

I actually found publishing on ff.net easier, if only because it didn't try to mess up my formatting. Though... I've just realised that the only thing I published on ff.net was explicit, hah! I suppose it wasn't picked up on.

I actually went to ff.net and sorted through the pairings - a favourite ship of mine has around 3000 fics on ao3 and under 1000 there. That's...slightly a problem, because I really am about my romance, going to no-slashes as a break only sometimes.
