The review thing is real interesting! When I leave a review on ao3, especially on a new story it usually goes along the lines of, ‘I loved (this part of the chapter, this idea, etc) your writing was really nice, I look forward to reading more'. I've seen some absolutely terrible reviews such as ‘love it' and although yes, any review is awesome!! it's just... hmm. I'm curious about this now, I'm definitely gonna go and have a look at some of the reviews and see if there's a difference.
