Yeah I'm with you on genres. I skim through a lot even in romance stories and you couldn't pay me to read 100k action story on goblins or Lord-something stories which for some reason happens a lot in ff.net.

Another thing that might sound weird but I found people tend to leave different kinds of reviews on these sites. One story that I published in both sites and from FF.net I got things like "Keep up!" or "Interesting start" while from ao3 users it was quoting a sentence they liked or just plain "love it". I think it's because on FF.net people tend to post and read longer stories.
