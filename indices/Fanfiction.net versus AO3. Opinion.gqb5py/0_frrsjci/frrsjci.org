I'd chose Ao3 both for reading and publishing.

1. It's a lot easier to find specific fics in Ao3 and have an idea what the fic is about from the tags, and excluding option for tags is great. Excessive tagging is maddening but I usually just skim if there's too many pairings, characters etc. I usually use "Entire Work" to see how many times a name is mentioned if I'm specifically looking to read a character. Also I like going through other people's bookmarks.
2. FF.net doesn't allow explicit content as well, so. I like to read romance with explicit content. Depending on how you see it, it might be a plus for FF.net.
3. Variety is definitely FF.net's strong point. FF.net seems to have more non-pairing stories. More action genre and generally longer fics when in Ao3 they are more focused on romance.
4. Sometimes I like to read the author's response to reviews and I can't do that on FF.net. I don't know if it's me but that's a plus for Ao3 as well.

As an author I think editing is a nightmare in FF.net and I absolutely hate it.
