No preferance really.

ff.net is my go to, simply because I have used it for 19 years, but I read whereever the fic I want to read is located. Some are only on ao3, some are only on ff.net, some are censored on ff.net, so i read them on ao3, etc.

And as to "how do you navigate ff.net". I have no idea where I could start, it is so totally basic and easy to navigate imo that I can't identify where you have problems so I could help.
