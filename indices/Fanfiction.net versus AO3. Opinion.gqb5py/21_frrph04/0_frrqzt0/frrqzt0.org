That's exactly what I want, because I acknowledge that there are so many fics that I'm missing on ff.net that I absolutely want to read alongside those on ao3.

I've gone back and attempted to navigate it again, and although I can get to the main page of fics for a fandom, are there more ways to be more selective? Can I select a certain slash I want to see and have only see those show up, or see smaller tags such as â€˜angst, fluff', etc? Can I exclude certain ships so that I can find my rare pair fics?

I apologise for the many questions and ignorance on my end, I've tinkered around on there but still have a difficult time finding my way around. Is there a difference between mobile/desktop?
