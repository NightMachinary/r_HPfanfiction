Ohh, you meant features. Yea, when it comes to stuff like filter options, ff.net is miles behind ao3.

Filtering by tags is straight up out. You can select a genre in the filters tho, like romance, angst, humor, horror and so on.

As for searching for specific pairings, you can do that. Click the pairings checkbox at the top in the Filter screen and select the up to 4 characters you want to search for. You can only exclude two characters, in the bottom of the Filter screen ("Without Filters"). Also again with a pairing checkbox if you want to exclude a pairing instead of just the characters. You can also exclude a genre and a "World" (Marauders era, post-Hogwarts, pre-Hogwarts, and so on).

And remember to always select Rating: All. The default search excludes the M rated fics...
