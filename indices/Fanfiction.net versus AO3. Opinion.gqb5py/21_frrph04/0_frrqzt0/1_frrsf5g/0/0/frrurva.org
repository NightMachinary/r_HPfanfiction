Yea, the pairings and characters you select need to be set by the author. Which makes it not very good since it is sometimes not done by the author.

For example [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5087671/1/Runic-Animagi][this]] fic is a Harry/Daphne fic. But as you see, it is only mentioned in the description. The fic settings only mention Harry and Daphne as characters, not as a pairing. Pairing would look like this: [Harry P., Daphne G.]

So if you look for Harry/Daphne with the pairing checkbox selected that fic won't show up...

As i said, very limited and dependant on the author to actually use correct settings for their fics. Most do, it is rare that they don't, but still.
