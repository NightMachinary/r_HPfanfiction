Thank you, this is absolutely what I've been needing. I've gotten stuck here in the past because I just didn't quite understand the filtering system, but this sums it up nicely! I've made a list of what I like/dislike for my own reference, and you might find is interesting.

Positives:

- the official world option is really nice, I haven't seen that before, and I'll definitely be using it!

- love that we're given how many fics there are for certain world counts straight up, I'm always curious

Negatives:

- the exclude zone is a little brief. does the pairing (plus) mean it's automatically the main pairing, or will I have to worry about rare pairs being hidden?

- the tags are very brief hahaha, I'll probably end up ignoring them but that's not too big a deal, just means I'll need to search a little harder
