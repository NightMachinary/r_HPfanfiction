Ao3. I don't know what it is but I prefer ao3 farrr more than ffnet. I've uploaded stories on both and while ffnet has a couple features on uploading that is better but I have a hard time having to upload a document there versus the copy and paste option that ao3 has which suits my needs better.

For reading, I prefer ao3 hands down. I will read some recs on here because I can't sort them the way I'd like at all and I prefer the content on ao3 more overall. Just my preference.

On the other hand, my sister loves ffnet and not ao3 so to each their own.
