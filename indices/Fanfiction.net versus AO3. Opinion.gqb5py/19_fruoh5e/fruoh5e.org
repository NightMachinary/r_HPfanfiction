Both have their ups and downs.

ArchiveOfOurOwn is in theory very nice to navigate, with its extensive tagging system and layout. Shame about the sheer amount of tag-abuse meaning you still have to navigate a minefield of tropes you don't want to read even after filtering out 9001 tags that all mean the same thing.

FanFiction.net looks a little more dated and isn't as nice to navigate/search on, but overall I've found that outside of duplicates (fics that appear on both websites) I have a higher success rate actually finding stuff I like on there once I've grappled with finding a search-term that does what I want it to do.
