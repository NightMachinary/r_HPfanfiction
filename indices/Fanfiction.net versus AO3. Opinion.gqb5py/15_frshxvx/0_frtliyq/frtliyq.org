I personally use Ao3 on both, but mainly my phone. On the computer the text is wide, and I resort to zooming in to rid myself of blank space and also save my eyes. I'm lightly annoyed by the lack of accessibility to see pictures on a phone, as often I can only see parts and not the whole image, even when zooming. Small things, though.
