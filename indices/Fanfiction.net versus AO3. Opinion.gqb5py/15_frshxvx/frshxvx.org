FF.net is easier to read but everything else I find more annoying.

Ao3 isn't as useful on a computer vs phone browsers but the informative and obvious tags are helpful for choosing fics, esp. where the concept could go both in directions I do like and ones I don't. Searching is easier too.

I guess FF.net has features I am not getting but they aren't as intuitive.
