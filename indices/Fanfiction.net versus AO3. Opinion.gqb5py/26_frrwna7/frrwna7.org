I tried posting on both but at the time I also didn't use FF for reading myself anymore, it was also a bit tedious to go back and forth when I clearly enjoyed Ao3 more. So I decided to delete everything on FF and just stay on Ao3, I use it for browsing and reading almost exclusively nowadays, might check FF-fic if it gets recommended and that's it. There wasn't much feedback on FF compared to Ao3 as well so I just chose my own comfort over a chance to have a possible slightly barely extended readership.
