AO3 is the better website, having been built by people sick of the shittiness of ffnet, and has a less toxic and hostile community for the same reason, but ffnet has more of the writers whose work I enjoy (including some that have passed away and thus will obviously not be crossposting their work).

Also, it may be partly due to sampling bias given how I look for new fics to read, but the overall character/vibe/feel of fics is different between the two sites, with ffnet having more standard stories and less of the deeply weird. There are a lot more niche interest and/or fetish fics on AO3.

EDIT: My tip for using ffnet is to start from stories you like and see what else their author has written and what fics/authors they've Favorited. Doing that (and looking at the Favorites lists of people that enjoy my work) continues to lead me to interesting/enjoyable fics, though that's slowed down in recent years as I seem to have mostly read the pre-existing stuff that fits my tastes and so now am largely watching for new content.
