As I use [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/]] for searching on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]], I don't consider it to be too difficult to search on there.

As for AO3, while there are those who overtag, and those who undertag. I generally can find what I want there a lot faster. The one problem is those who write Lover&Lover and Friend/Friend. Instead of Lover/Lover and Friend&Friend. That can get rather annoying.

As for navigationability, I don't consider one better than the other. AO3 has the series feature to tag fics together which is nice. Especially when you're looking trough 50+ fics to find the first one in the series you want but found the 5th fic for.
