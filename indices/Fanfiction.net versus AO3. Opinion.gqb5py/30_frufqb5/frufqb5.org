I exclusively read. Here are my thoughts:

I prefer fanfiction.net as it has an app and things can be downloaded easily on it and read from there. (However I find all my fics by googling what I want and then finding the user on ff.net so that is annoying)

AO3 is very annoying to me as you enjoyment is based on what application you dowload fics to. I've had wonderful experiences and awful ones. [If you now a good app to download fics on to Samsung let me know]

However if you aren't looking to download and are reading them straight off the website, fanfiction.net is better as it is much more customizable (change font and size, contrast, and width) whereas on AO3 you are stuck with the terrible default settings unless you externally invert the colors or change font size. I find this incredibly annoying as reading black on white really bothers me.
