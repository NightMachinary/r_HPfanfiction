This is fascinating! I've been in many, many fandoms, and HP is a much newer one for me.

Honestly, I'm the completely opposite to you - this subreddit pains me because so much is recced from ff.net, and I can't handle it. Unless a fic is apparently absolutely amazing, or I'm looking for a rare pair, 9/10 times I'm going to ignore ff.net links.

I personally find that looking for fics on ff.net is extremely difficult - there aren't many tags, except for word count (which is very general, mind you), the story bio is often cut off, and even the slash confuses me.

When I first found ao3 I was extremely confused, and it was a mess. Using it years later, some features still confuse me, but finding fics is extremely easy. Word count: between __ or __. Choose specific ships to be included, exclude ones you can't stand. Looking for angst? there's a tag! looking for pwp? well uh, there's a tag! All you really need to know is how to work with the tags and it becomes super easy to navigate, though I'm sure it sounds more complicated than it actually is.

Enjoy your time reading on ff.net, and I'll enjoy mine on ao3! Maybe one day we can breach the waters and explore unknown territory.
