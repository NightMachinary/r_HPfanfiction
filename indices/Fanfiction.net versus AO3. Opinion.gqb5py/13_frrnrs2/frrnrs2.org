I'm only a casual reader I suppose in that I've read exclusively Harry Potter fanfics, and even if for the last 6 or so years daily I seem to have not read anywhere near as much as others, so take my opinion with a pinch.

But I digress, I only read off of ff.net personally. I find the interface of finding fics infinitely nicer than ao3. The layout, the usability, the style even is so much nicer and easier to me than ao3 to the point that ao3 is genuinely unusable to me.

If I find a fic is on ao3 exclusively I won't bother to read it unless it's of such interest to me that it likely will slot into my top 10 kinda list, and even then it's mood dependant.

This is all ofc just my opinion, and I may just be a weird outlier.
