I usually read on FFN, largely because I can't stand the tag spam on AO3. Anything I read on AO3 is usually a recommendation from somewhere else(like here).

I also like that I can browse just HP fanfics (without crossovers), or browse through specific crossovers(just HP/Avengers, just HP/Fate etc.).'

For tips try starting with a standard sort. Mine for example:

- Sort: Follows or Favorites
- Rating: All
- Language: English

Those three and nothing else to start.

From there I'll play with Length (>10k or >20k) to remove smaller one shots or brief abandoned fics. Or go big with >100k for longer fics.

Time Range is a great tool to separate active fics from inactive fics, so I'll sometimes add Time Range: 1 Month, 6 Months, and rarely 1 Week to include only fics updated/published in that period.

Since you typically read slash pick your Character A and Character B, but be sure to toggle the Pairing check box(top right of the filter window) to get those. Sometimes slash is indicated in author notes instead of character tags which require more browsing on your part to find.

If you're not looking for pairing but a certain character's involvement, choose them but don't toggle the Pairing box.

If that doesn't turn up what you want, you can also try browsing through HP communities under the Community tab. I don't read slash, but I've noticed several collections of Snarry, Drarry, etc in there.

edit: Also, if you find an author you like, then go to their profile and check out their favorites. Odds are good that you'll find something there that you like too :)
