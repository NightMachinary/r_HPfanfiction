I prefer FFN and find it easier to find the kind of fics I like. The overtagging on AO3 means that when I try to sort by a certain tag, I get a bunch of results that only use it as a minor element and aren't relevant to what I'm looking for. I also prefer FFN's system for favoriting fics. It makes it easier to find them again later especially if you are in multiple fandoms.

I have noticed that gen fics tend to be more popular on FFN and what shipping fics do get popular usually have some sort of plot besides the ship going on. AO3 gets more focused on shipping. As I usually want to read gen fics, that means FFN is better for me.

I will say that on the whole, some fandoms are more active on one than the other. I can't speak to Harry Potter as I haven't posted any fics, but I corsspost everything to both sites. There is definitely a trend by fandom where certain fics will be more popular on one site than the other.

I use both. I find FFN easier to navigate but the fact that not everyone crossposts and things will get sorted differently on AO3 means that occasionally I find good fics on AO3 that I don't find on FFN.

  h o w do you use ff.net? I need some tips because obviously I've been doing it wrong

Sort by number of favorites and by the character, pairing, or crossover you really want to read (pick one). Your results will all contain that character, pairing, or crossover as a major element of the story.
