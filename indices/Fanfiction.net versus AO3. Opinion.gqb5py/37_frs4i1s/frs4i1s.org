As a reader, FF.net has a larger choice of fics, however, the big problem is that the platform is seemingly completely unmoderated. Someone can troll, flood a comment section with hateful messages and the site administration will do nothing to stop it.

For Ao3, the layout is nicer, despite the sometimes overabundance of tags, it does help to make a better informed choice of what you are choosing to read. And I haven't yet seen too many trolls there.
