Ao3 all day, man.

The search function is far more capable than FFnet's by miles. I can find tropes I'm looking for while leaving out things I don't want. I see so many people complaining about tags on Ao3, but I don't see how the barely functioning search function at FFnet holds a candle to Ao3's capabilities.

I have no issues uploading fics. The text editor is wonky, but since I convert everything to HTML beforehand I don't have any issues with it.

I also really like the organization capabilities - having actual series that people can easily follow rather than expecting a reader to go sort through an author's profile in order to find a sequel.

And there's also moral reasons. FFnet uses ads and tries to profit off of fanfiction that they didn't even write - they are breaking the oldest rule of fanfiction and it just feels wrong. Ao3 is funded by fans for fans and they're genuinely looking out for us.
