I can agree with that! I love the tagging on ao3, it's really brilliant, but not so much when writers neglect to tag, as often then I miss fics that are what I'm looking for, but just don't say it. (eg, slytherin harry. love sorting through this tag, but I've found so many untagged fics that it can be meaningless at times)

On the other hand, you get writers who tag every damn thing to the point where you're looking for something specific and they keep coming up despite not being relevant (eg, looking for a rare pair but a fic has tagged about 100 relationships. goddamnit...)
