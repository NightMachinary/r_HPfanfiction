I prefer fanfiction.net. The simple reason is the abundance of underage and/ or rape sex fics on AO3. Not that there aren't any on fanfiction, but they get deleted there. But AO3 not only tolerates them but even has specific tags for them. I refuse to patronize a site that tolerates pedophiles.

And don't give me the "But it's art" line. Usually I am very much against censorship of art, but I draw the line at pedophilia. It's... curious that there are so many who readily defend it online. I suppose it's the anonimity of it all. Not a lot of folks would defends /those/ sorts of fics IRL.
