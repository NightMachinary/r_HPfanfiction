That's a fair point - I've seen a ridiculous amount of content which is just... not okay on ao3. I have a difficult time browsing in public because of the abundance of smut and the extremely tagging on these that frankly, is terrifying.

I'm a pretty open person. I'm not necessarily against works of fiction that contain this, but I'm certainly not going to read it myself, and I'd prefer for it to not pop up when I'm searching. I completely understand the reluctance, as I do not condone this in real life and often people take it way, way too far, and ao3 is actively letting this happen.
