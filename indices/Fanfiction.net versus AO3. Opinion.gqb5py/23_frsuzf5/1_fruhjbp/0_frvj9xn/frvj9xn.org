Fair enough. I think if people only fantasize about it through writing and those japanese comics they aren't necessarily guilty. But they still need help like therapy because this is not normal.

Yeah, I read about that once. I can't remember if it was an article or reddit post but it basically pointed out the double standard for female pedos. Articles about female teachers molesting their male students almost never use "rape" or "assault" and in the comments lots of men congratulate the student for doing it with a teacher. It's rather concerning.
