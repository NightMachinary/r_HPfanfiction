Personally I'm just the person who says pedophilia is a subject that needs to be discussed more openly. It also needs to have more research dedicated to it. There isn't a lot of research and a lot of it can just be thrown out because it only focuses on male or offending pedophiles, or even worse only people who have committed sexual crimes against children.

So I won't defend it but I'd love to have more conversations about it.
