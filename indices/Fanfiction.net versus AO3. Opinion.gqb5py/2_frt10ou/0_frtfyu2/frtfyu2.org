Hah! I've only been reading fanfiction in general for a couple years, so you're way ahead of me. You're also the complete opposite of me - ao3 is comforting whilst I get intimidated and have a hard time with navigation (I understand after being helped by the people here, but it's still bothers me!) on ff.net. Occasionally I'll read on ff.net if I'm given a link from here, but it really isn't my preferable site to read on.
