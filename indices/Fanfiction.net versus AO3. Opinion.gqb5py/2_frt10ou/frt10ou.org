I've used [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] for over 15 years. I understand it, I can navigate it. It has its problems, but I kind of find it comforting in a way as it's the platform I've always used to read and post. AO3 I find really intimidating and I can t get my head around the navigation if I'm looking for something new. If I see a rec here though I have no problem reading a specific fic on there, it's just tryint to look for one that I find hard.
