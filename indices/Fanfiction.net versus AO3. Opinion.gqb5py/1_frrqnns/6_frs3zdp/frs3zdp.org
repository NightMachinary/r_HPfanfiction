I was going to comment, but this pretty much did it lol. Pretty much, AO3 wins in terms of aesthetic presentation but if you're an author, it is a nightmare. I have 3 fics on ff.net and have only bothered putting the most popular on one AO3 so far because it's a pain to post on that site.

Fanfiction.net also tends to have a higher average quality for writing, I would say. A lot of smut and such on AO3 since their guidelines are practically nonexistent.
