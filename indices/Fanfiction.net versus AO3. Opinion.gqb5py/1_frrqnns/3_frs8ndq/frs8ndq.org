Adding to this, I read on mobile and find FF.Net to be much easier on the eyes because of their app. I can never seem to get AO3 to be large enough or smooth enough. I did learn recently that I can download stories off AO3 and open them in Google Books to read, but that's a whole extra step. So I usually just stick to FF.Net
