Wow, we have had vastly different experiences, as I disagree with all your conclusions, haha XD

  FF.Net is far superior as an author.

As an author, I prefer AO3. I don't have any trouble with formatting (I just copy paste from Word and it turns out fine) and I quickly got used to tagging. Some of my fandoms/ships are more active on AO3, and commenters are much kinder and easier to interact with. FFn is also THE WORST for editing a posted chapter, and they've deleted a fic of mine for....no reason. Their mods are insane.

  FF.Net is superior for browsing and finding fics.

Depends on how you browse. I prefer AO3 as reader, if I'm looking for stories on my own, because I guess I filter for tropes, not characters (like, you want Harry-centric stories, that's easier to find on ffn, but if I'm looking for something like Time Travel, AO3 is easier and more accurate to find. You can also Exclude a pairing or, like, ALL M/M, if you want). I have no idea how to find anything on FFn without this sub, lol

  Once you have found a fic to read, AO3 is easier on the eyes to read it on.

As I read on mobile, the FFn app is a GODSEND. The AO3 website is clean and well-formatted and all, but I can only stand it on my computer, or downloading it to an epub reader. On mobile I like to customize my fonts and sizes and night mode.

Guess we have super different points of view of both these sites :)
