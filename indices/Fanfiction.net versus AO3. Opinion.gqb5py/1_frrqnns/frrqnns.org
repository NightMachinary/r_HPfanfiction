*Fanfiction.net:*

- Much larger readership.

- Readership is more likely to leave reviews.

- Uploading chapters is a lot easier, as all formatting is preserved except for section breaks.

- Cannot link external websites in profiles or Author's Notes.

- Default page layout is far too wide.

*AO3:*

- Nicer page layout/presentation.

- Fic uploader is a real chore and in particular does very weird things to italics followed by punctuation marks, which requires extensive manual correction. Also turns line breaks into double line breaks which also requires manual correction. It takes about 20 mins to upload a chapter to AO3 and even then I continue to see errors in it when I happen to be browsing my story content.

- Tag spam makes it practically impossible to exclude non-Harry-centric fics because everyone tags Harry in their story regardless of whether he is the protagonist. When you combine this with the fact that non-Harry-centric fics vastly outnumber Harry-centric fics on AO3, it basically means that browsing for fics on AO3 is such a chore that it's unusable. Contrast FF.Net where if you set Character A = Harry, you're going to get 99% Harry-centric fics.

- Tag spam also makes it very difficult to exclude slash on AO3. A fic which is Harry/Ginny in chapter 1 before Harry leaves Ginny for Draco is going to be tagged both Harry/Ginny and Harry/Draco. So if you're browsing by the Harry/Ginny tag, the fic will still show up. This has got easier recently, since AO3 introduced the ability to exclude by tags. So you just have to save a search where you have added every slash pairing you can think of to the exclude field. Good luck finding gen fics on AO3 though.

*Conclusion:*

- FF.Net is far superior as an author.

- FF.Net is superior for browsing and finding fics.

- Once you have found a fic to read, AO3 is easier on the eyes to read it on.
