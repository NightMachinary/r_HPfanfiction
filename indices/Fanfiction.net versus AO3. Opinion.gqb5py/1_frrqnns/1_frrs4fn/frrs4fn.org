This is probably the most helpful comment I've seen! I've published on both, and admittedly ff.net was much easier, and finding reviews was easier on ao3. Both sites have issues and both have merits.

I suppose I disagree with the browsing fics being easier on ff.net simply because I love my tags, despite the tag spam, but hopefully I'll be able to take away from this and understand what I've been missing so that I can properly experience ff.net. I still don't understand the filtering system there.

Thank you for laying out both sites for me, it really allows me to reflect on what both sites are good at and how they compare to each other.
