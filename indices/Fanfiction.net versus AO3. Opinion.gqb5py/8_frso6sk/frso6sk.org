AO3 over FFN any day.

I find it almost impossible to find fics by pairing on ffn. If I want Harmony fic, ideally I would choose [Harry P. Hermione G.]. But many authors don't mark pairings, so I have to sort through tons of fics that have Harry and Hermione as characters but are actually gen, Harry/Ginny, Hermione/Ron, Harry/anyone, Hermione/anyone.

While many here dislike tags, they also give you a general idea of a fic. More so, you can exclude things that you don't like, and while it won't exclude 100% of the fics with it, it would exclude most of them. You can also sort by straight/slash/femslash and exclude things like rape and underage.

I like the option to open the entire work on AO3. It's very useful when I want to reread some particular scene and don't remember what chapter it was, so I can just search the whole text. The comment section on ao3 is also much better and actually allows a discussion.
