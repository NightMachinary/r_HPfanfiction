I absolutely love tags - I enjoy certain tropes (soulmate au, time travel, MoD, etc) and tagging just makes it so accessible to find these so long as the writer is tagging correctly. I also agree with the entire work option too, as it supports my crappy internet much better and allows me to find certain parts again.
