Sorting through that way can be good (over 100k, Harry Potter character, favourites), and you end up finding classics that are great to discuss because so many people have read them. I also agree that discovering fics on ao3 is easy, and I find myself clicking on fics more often as I can find tropes I enjoy through the cluttered tags. That's probably why I'm so hesitant to dive into ff.net
