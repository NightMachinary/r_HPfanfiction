I prefer AO3 and when I dry up the well there, I go back to ffn to read old fics from like 2008 era

Generally, I don't take chances on fics on ffn while the tag system will make me take a chance on unfinished fics on ao3. On ffn, I always read the recommendations, those being usually older fics, so I only ever read complete fics on ffn.

So I don't really navigate ffn tbh. Setting the filter to complete fics with words over 100k and Harry Potter as a character, sorting by favorites give me some classic fics. Basically the fics that won the popularity contest. I only ever discover fics on ao3
