I read and publish on both AO3 has the superior search feature for reading and thus to me, makes it the easier one to read on.

Both are no trouble for me for writing. I write all my chapters in a doc, run it through Grammarly once, proofread once, upload to ffn, copy/paste over to AO3 and upload. Takes less than 5 mins to upload both don't even have to change page breaks.
