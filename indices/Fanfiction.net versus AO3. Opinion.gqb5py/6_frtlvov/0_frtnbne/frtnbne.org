Haha, I get that. I personally read mostly boy x boy, so I'm guilty there. The site is great because finding that content can be hard, but on ao3 it's popular and everything is in one place. I completely understand the frustration for someone that isn't interested though - us b/b shippers can make the most outrageous ships out of characters that have had little interaction and yet it'll still be extremely popular and overshadow those that do make sense.
