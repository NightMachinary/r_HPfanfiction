Ao3 as a whole has in my opinion slightly higher quality stores. My only issue is they are highly pairing obsessed with most of them being Boy X Boy. While I have no problem with that as an actual relationship, reading about it doesn't really interest me. However, there are some real gems on ao3. I have heard a lot about the sorting system of ao3 but have never personally used it myself as I get most of my fic recommendations from Reddit. Fanfiction, on the other hand is what I use most frequently. Mainly, due to its awesome app and the fact that I am more used to it.
