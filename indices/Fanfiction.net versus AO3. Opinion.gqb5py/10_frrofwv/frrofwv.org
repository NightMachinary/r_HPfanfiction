I don't use ff.net. Back when it was the only real database around, it had some strict restrictions on content such as explicit fics, so I used to read everything on livejournal. I have found ao3 to be adequate for my fic needs since, so I haven't gone back to check ff.net out. Also, I like that ao3 has the ability to exclude crossovers in searches.
