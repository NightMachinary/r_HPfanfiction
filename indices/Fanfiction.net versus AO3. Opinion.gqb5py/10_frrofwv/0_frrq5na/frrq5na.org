It had restrictions on explicit fics? Is this still around, or did that go? Honestly I can't even begin to imagine ao3 like that - people would go mad. I used to use wattpad as my first way to find fics, and gosh, never again. I was young and everything looked good, a statement I cannot agree with now that I'm several years older.

Branching away from wattpad, I found various sites, and stuck with ao3. I agree that being able to exclude crossovers (among many things) is a great feature, I wish more sites could implement this!
