This reminds me of a more serious theory that making a Horcrux requires committing an act even /you/ find depraved, which is harder and harder because the more your soul is damaged, the less inhibitions you have. So Riddle started with the murder of his parents that was sorta-kinda justified, and moved "up" from there. In Godric's Hollow he didn't take any protections for his soul because he still had a bit more humanity than he /thought/ he did --- the fact of killing an innocent baby over his mother's pleas was still a bit too much for him and that was why it accidentally fractured his soul once again.
