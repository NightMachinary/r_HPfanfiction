I know that theory, but eh, I dunno... it feels like a body-related ritual seems to be sort of missing the point for what is quintessentially soul magic. Also, surely it'd have come up in the investigation if Hepzibah Smith and Co. had been mutilated and half-eaten --- whereas the authorities deemed it likely enough in Smith's case that she had been /poisoned/. So good try but no cigar.
