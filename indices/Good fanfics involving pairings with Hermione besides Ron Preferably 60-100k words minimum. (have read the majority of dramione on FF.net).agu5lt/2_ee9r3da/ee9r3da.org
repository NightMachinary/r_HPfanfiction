If you read a lot of Draco/Hermione, have you checked out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11894165/1/The-Eagle-s-Nest][The Eagle's Nest]] by HeartOfAspen? It's 306K words long, and complete (the author having just finished January 2). Obviously, Draco and Hermione have the two lead roles locked down but Theodore Nott also has a pretty big part too.
