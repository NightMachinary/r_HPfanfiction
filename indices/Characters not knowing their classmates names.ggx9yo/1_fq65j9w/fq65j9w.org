I think that's often to show the disconnect between Slytherin & Gryffindor, personally. I don't know about the specific cases you're referring to, but when I read about Harry not knowing someone from Slytherin, I think it's usually shorthand for "Harry didn't care to know them because he thinks all Slytherins are trash".

That being said, yeah-- His lack of knowledge can be a bit excessive at times. You're right that it would make sense for him to at least know last name/have a vague opinion of who they are from class.
