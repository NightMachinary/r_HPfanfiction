It is not unreasonable that he wouldn't know all the names during the first and second year but I do agree that it is pushing it slightly to not know the names by fifth year, at least for the Slytherins. Ravenclaws would be way more belivable since they don't seem to be sharing any classes with them or at the very least no classes where it is everyone from Ravenclaw. But I would at the same time not say that it is impossible, I know that I have forgotten the names of the people in my year many times and haven't remembered them until weeks later.
