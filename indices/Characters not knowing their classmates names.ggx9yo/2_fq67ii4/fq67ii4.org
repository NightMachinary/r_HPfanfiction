You're completely right, Harry's year is forty-something so he really doesn't have any excuse to not know anyone's name. I didn't know many people's names in my year, but that's because we never shared any classes and my year was more than a hundred and I hang out with either older or younger students for the most part, so I have reasons. Everyone in his year was even presented during the Sorting Ceremony.
