The [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/tags/harry-potter/][SpaceBattles]] and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/tags/harry-potter/][Sufficient Velocity]] forums have some quests, but I couldn't find an index, so you'll have to dig through the HP tag. Quests are stories where the author posts a chapter and gives some options at the end for readers to vote on. They don't (usually) have branching paths, but it is interactive fiction. [[/alt_text][]]
