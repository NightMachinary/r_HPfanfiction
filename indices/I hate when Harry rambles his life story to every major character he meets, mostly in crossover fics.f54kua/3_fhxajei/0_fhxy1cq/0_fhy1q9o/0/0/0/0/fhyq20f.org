For the first part, true - though I admit I think of the 'war veteran Harry's subgenre as one where the war - win or lose - lasted several years of heavy fighting. One where Harry would have seen significantly more fighting than in canon, at least.

For the making the enemy stronger, I mean more structurally - and likely in an AU sense. For instance, obviously it's already different from canon in the first timeline - and if we're making Harry comparatively overpowered, I don't mind upping the threat he faces.

Like you note, the bad guys are written in canon as incredibly inept. That makes it very easy to up the difficulty by making them /competent/ - which is very different from your Naruto example, where it's just BS powering up in a heavy handed way. I can see how the suggestion of rituals might strike you as leading to that, but I was meaning it more as a way to justify how magically weaker opponents might pose a threat on a different axis. There's certainly enough space in the dark arts to allow for such methods, imo.

(Basically, time travel AU makes the good guy competent - so if we want the bad guys to be a threat, they also need to be made competent, and so need to be powered up in some way imo. Plus I personally prefer reading about competent antagonists anyways!)
