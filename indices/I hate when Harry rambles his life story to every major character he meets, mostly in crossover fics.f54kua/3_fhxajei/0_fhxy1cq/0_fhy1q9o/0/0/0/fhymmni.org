  Though a time travel war Harry doesn't necessarily have to be /that/ strong - I could easily see him still being a bit below the better fighters (eg, Bellatrix and Snape) or roughly on par with them, instead of being as strong as Dumbledore/Voldemort.

Or they could use Canon War Vet Harry, who isn't exactly top tier. Just in case I'll put my arguement as a spoiler.

>! He didn't win on power levels, or massive skill. He won on luck, pure and simple. Other than the patronus we never actually see his "power" and skill wise just about everyone has him beat as the only times he appears to actually try and learn is for the first task and maybe for the DA. The DoM is mostly running from and using schoolboy magic on hardened criminals....!<

  Another way is to up the difficulty against him - making the rank and file death eaters much better in cooperation, or using dark magic/rituals to be more of a threat, etc.

Ohh god please no. I hate this. It makes absolutely no sense. Unless Harry is an idiot and gives away all his secrets to the enemy, they would have absolutely no reason to do the rituals, or learn to work together better. They are all arrogant, and fully believe that they are superior to those "not of pure blood" even with ample evidence against the notion.

This kind of thing really puts me off a story... I'll use another fandom as an example. If you have a Naruto fic where he actually learns/time travels/can finally tie his shoes by himself, most authors then go down the "up the difficulty" route by making "I'm an unbeatable("no no, Itachi didn't beat me, i don't know what your talking abouty...Hanzo? I'm alive and thus he didn't beat me either...") immortal" Orochimaru, or "Call me God" Pein apparently decide a wet behind the ears genin is such a threat to them that they need to get stronger/take him seriously.

It's basically a cheap anti-OP tactic used by writers that can't adjust the story for a stronger MC with out it. The problem with HP is that the "bad guys" are so inept they couldn't win against a competent opponent. Sadly the "good guys" were thus made incapable.
