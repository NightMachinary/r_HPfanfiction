Ah, I see what you mean then. Yeah, those types of stories don't always make the most sense.

Though a time travel war Harry doesn't necessarily have to be /that/ strong - I could easily see him still being a bit below the better fighters (eg, Bellatrix and Snape) or roughly on par with them, instead of being as strong as Dumbledore/Voldemort. Another way is to up the difficulty against him - making the rank and file death eaters much better in cooperation, or using dark magic/rituals to be more of a threat, etc. More fun to up the difficulty than to handwave away the final task happening exactly the same way IMO!
