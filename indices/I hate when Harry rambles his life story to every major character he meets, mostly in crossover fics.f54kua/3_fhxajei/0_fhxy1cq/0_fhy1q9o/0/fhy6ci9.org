Ah sorry probably didn't explain myself properly. I'm not a fan of time travel fics where they do nothing but I've seen a lot of fics where the consequences of the final task happen exactly the same (Voldemort resurrected, someone probably dies) and it doesn't make sense to me.

If we're talking time travel war Harry then the only things that could beat him is quirrell, basilisk, dragon and adult Voldemort I believe
