IDK - depending on where in time he got brought back, the 3rd task sounds like an overly long amount of time. For instance, prior to 3rd year, you'd have to expect him to want to get Sirius out of prison ASAP and catch Pettigrew. Prior to 1st year, he knows that Voldemort is on the back of Quirrel's head and that the diary is in Malfoy's hands - so that seems like just as easy a point to try to trap voldemort than waiting.

There'd need to be a reason why he would decide not to interfere prior to that, IMO - the obvious one being if he got brought back to 4th year.
