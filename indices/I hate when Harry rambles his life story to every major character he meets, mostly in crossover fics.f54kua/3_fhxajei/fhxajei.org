Yeah, I really hat this too. Just read a time-travel story where Harry and Hermione fought against Emperor Voldemort for ten years or so (Voldy won). Hermione died and Harry managed to travel back in time.\\
Anyway, both Harry and Hermi ended up with the full knowledge of their previous life in their bodies of the third year. They talk about how big their secret is and that they have to plan everything in order to save people etc. - the typical stuff.\\
And what do they do...?! They keep blabbering to each other how many secrets they have and were overheard two times by Malfoy and some other random idiot. They suddenly start to kiss with each other and can't stop acting like in 50 shades of grey. Their sexual tensions radiate like the aura of a Veela. And ofc, they need to tell every good guy they know. Not a week passes and McGonnangal knows about, second week Remus, and shortly after that Sirius, Moody, Tonks, Andromeda, Weasly Twins.

Idk, but I think it is the best for everyone if a time-travel Harry keeps his secrets to himself and manipulates stuff without endangering people. In most stories, Harry is some kind of war-veteran, or an experienced one shortly after he killed Voldy. He can easily chill and prepare himself until the third task of the tri-w-tourney or manipulate the vanishing cabinet event in a way where all Deatheaters end up in a huge hole full of blast-ended skewts.

And telling someone like Hermione is also bad if she is like canon and ends up running to Dumbles. She will be too young to defend herself anyway, and Harry would only put her in a state of panic and danger. The pressure of the knowledge would make her restless and Harry will end up telling his secrets to more people at the end.

Best is to simply analyze the situation and manipulate stuff in a way where he slowly builds up multiple advantages he can use when the time for action comes. Like learning more magic, body-enhancing rituals, searching for more ways to handle Voldy. By telling the secret to anyone, Harry will only lose every advantage he has. Sure another ally might be useful, but only if its someone like Nevilles Grandma or another adult who can REALLY help Harry. Sirius is a good guy, but he is limited due to his situation. He can help Harry train, but that he will do anyway without knowing the secret - it would also help cover up his sudden gain of knowledge and combat experience.
