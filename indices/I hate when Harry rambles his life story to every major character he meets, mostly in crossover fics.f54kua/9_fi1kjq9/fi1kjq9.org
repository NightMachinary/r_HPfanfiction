I agree with this in general; that sort of emotional openness is entirely OOC for Harry, who wasn't even candid with Ron and Hermione. It's poor writing to use that sort of shortcut to ramp up intimacy/friendship among characters.

However, one thing should be considered: as an adult who has worked through his painful childhood, the facts of the abuse would hold less power over Harry. I speak from the experience of eight years of therapy; things I couldn't have discussed earlier no linger are painful to speak of now. It's just fact, and I don't feel victimized to speak of things done to me. But it's true I wouldn't be open with strangers or mere acquaintances, although if I were trying to counsel someone, I might.
