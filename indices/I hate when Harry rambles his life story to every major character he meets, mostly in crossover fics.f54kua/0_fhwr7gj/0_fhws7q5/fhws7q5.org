Harry in canon like majority abused children, hated sharing his time with Dursleys. He never shared extent of his treatment with even with Hermione and Ron. But in fics, he tells everything to a stranger. Even worst, he was mostly senior Auror or War veteran and a reincarnation of Moody. People who works in Law Enforcement rarely reveals their past to anyone.
