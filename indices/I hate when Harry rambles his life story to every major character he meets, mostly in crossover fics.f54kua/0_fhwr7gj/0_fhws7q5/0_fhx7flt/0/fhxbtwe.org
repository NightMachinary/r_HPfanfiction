I agree - there's definitely a way to work it in pretty easily, I think. But personally I'd lean towards having those be fairly short interactions - offhand mentions of his past that gets slightly built upon (eg - mentioning his relatives used to put him in a closet under the stairs, or that he's used to people looking at him, or that being targeted by a dark wizard is normal to him, etc). But just going off and rambling on about his past in an expositary manner seems to be more difficult (and imo best done a while later anyways - have 2-3 moments where he discusses some small part of his background, comes to trust whoever he's talking to, and then fade to black as he goes into explaining it)
