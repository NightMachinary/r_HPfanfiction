I think it strongly depends on the context of the situation. Harry randomly opening up would be indeed weird, but if the preceeding conversation goes a certain way, it wouldn't be OOC (eg Harry telling someone that he knows how awful life can be, someone questioning why Harry is very on edge/expecting something bad to happen). From there on, the conversation can go to the Dursleys or Voldemort, but it isn't the easiest set-up. And the younger Harry is, the more likely he's to open up or let something slip.
