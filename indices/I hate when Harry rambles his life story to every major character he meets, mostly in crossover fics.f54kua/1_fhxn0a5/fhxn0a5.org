Yeah, it really irks me too. And it never happens naturally either. He doesn't slowly reveal his past whenever it's relevant. He just loads his whole backstory onto random people.

I once read a fanfic where Harry went back in time and met Ron on the train again. Cue Ron asking about the scar and Harry going off on him about how his parents died and he was abused and got no food and locked in a cupboard and how Ron should be happy he has a family. Hermione talking about how insensitive Ron was and the fic portraying Ron as a douche because he asked about the scar and Harry as this poor orphan. But when you think about it for more than 3 seconds you realise that an adult Harry shamed an 11 year old for asking a stupid question.
