In linkao3(22144981) Harry, Neville, Luna and Cedric are reincarnations of Salazar, Godric, Rowena and Helga. I haven't read it, so I'm unsure of the quality.

There is an Amulet of Time series. Post GoF, canon pairings. Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione travel back in time via a strange amulet (they do it on the way to Hogwarts for their 5th year IIRC).

They are sent back to the Founders Era for a year, then they use the amulet again and appear during the war with Grindelwald, then they have a relatively peaceful year in 1975 and then they are finally back in their own time to defeat Voldemort.

I've read only the 3rd and 4th parts 4 years ago, so I don't remember much.
