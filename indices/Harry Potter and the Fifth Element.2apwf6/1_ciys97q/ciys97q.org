I've tried to read this twice now. It has the worst case of diary-fic-itus I've ever encountered. I simply can't get past that.

The author doesn't seem to understand why we don't need or really want a panopticon view of every character's exact history and current internal state. They waste the reader's time with this over and over again, drawing out boring, uninteresting scenes to horriffic lengths. There is no real point of view character and everything seems oddly passive, like it is being described by an disinterested and unfocussed reporter who gets paid by the word.

This kills the story flow.
