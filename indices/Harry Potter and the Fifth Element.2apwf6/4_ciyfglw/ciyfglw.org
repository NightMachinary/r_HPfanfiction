Hmm. I read it -- up to a point -- on ff.net. It is well written (even though the author needs their /licence to whom/ revoked), but not well constructed. Talking at cross purposes, missed connections and miscommunication can all be interesting, but a lot less so when we get to see the perspectives and thoughts of all the parties involved.

Then, at least until the BA17 incident -- when everything starts to get weird, there are hardly any sympathetic characters to be found. I am kind of used to Harry being a twat, but I've hardly ever read a Hermione that was such an arsehole. It's a story that keeps telling me that they should be together, but I don't see why. Those two, as written, don't make me root for them and so I stopped reading.

It might be better if it was shorter. As it is I read hundreds of thousands of words, but I doubt I will ever make it to -- and past -- the million. “Because it's there!” is not a justification for much.
