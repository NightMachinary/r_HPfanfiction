If we go by stereotypes (pure knowledge vs deviousness and ruthlessness) then I'd say Slytherin wins handily. One exception is if Ravenclaws start fiddling with exotic forbidden magics like Fiendfyre and end up destroying both sides.

That's provided Slytherin is led by someone so powerful it's in everyone's best interest to follow them (e.g. Tom Riddle). Otherwise I would expect a lot of backstabbing and scheming and everyone putting their individual well-being before their side's.
