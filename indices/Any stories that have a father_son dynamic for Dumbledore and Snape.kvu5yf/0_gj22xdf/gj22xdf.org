[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/670548?view_adult=true#main][The Boy Who Died a Lot]] by star-crossedgirl. Harry's always been known as The Boy Who Lived. Only Severus knows that this is a lie. (Or: a portrait of Severus Snape, in seven acts.) complete. Slash (but only really at the very end). AO3.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4437151/1/][Harry's New Home]] by Kbinz. One lonely little boy. One snarky, grumpy git. When the safety of one was entrusted to the other, everyone knew this was not going to turn out well... Or was it? AU, sequel to "Harry's First Detention". OVER FIVE MILLION HITS! FFNet.

Both have a great Snape and Dumbledore dynamic
