I think this is a very good idea, actually. Unfortunately, I don't know of any stories like this. I'm currently writing a Harry/Hermione story right now that takes place after Deathly Hallows (ignoring the Epilogue) in which Harry develops feelings for Hermione during Order of the Phoenix but doesn't act upon them until years later. When Ron finds about Harry's feelings for Hermione, he decides to leave England for Paris, and in doing so, gets over the up-and-coming relationship between Harry and Hermione. The story, however, isn't told from Ron's POV, but Harry's instead.
