Things like this have been done from Ron's POV, though usually with Ron either clueless about what's going on with H/Hr or overly supportive of them (rather than more realistically jealous). And quite a few Harmony fics over the years have emphasized Ron's perspective, even if his viewpoint isn't the only (or most prominent) one in the fic.

One somewhat decent one that comes to mind is [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/9101]["Whatever I Am To You" by Aeryn]], a longish one-shot that begins with Ron's POV soon after the final battle in DH, then moves to Harry's POV, then Hermione's.

I feel like I've read some other ones that were also more neutral with Ron's POV (i.e., not making him too OOC), but they aren't common, I agree.

My only other main comment is:

#+begin_quote
  We all know about the standard Harry/Hermione fics. Harmony gets together, Ron/Ginny/Dumbledore/Molly gets bashed, love potion plot, unblocked magical cores, big trunk/bank account/wand(s), good goblins, etc etc etc. It's nothing new.

If this is your perception of Harmony fics, I think you may need to read around more. I know you are presenting a stereotype, but I personally quite dislike bashing fics. I think love potion plots are stupid. And the rest... has nothing to do with H/Hr. I almost exclusively read H/Hr these days, and I was actually quite shocked the other day when I got partway through a story and saw a love potion plot device appear -- I have so rarely seen a fic recommended by other Harmony fans that involve these that I haven't read "one in the wild" in quite a few years. (Maybe there are teenagers still writing these regularly with bad grammar/spelling or something and posting somewhere, but I don't read trash.)

And bashing is a matter of degree, but I personally can't stand the more overt ones (as I actually like all of the characters, with all of their good and bad). Yet still I have found hundreds and hundreds of great H/Hr stories. I'd say the majority of stories that I have seen highly recommended on [[/r/hpharmony]] don't involve significant bashing.

Which all is context to say that *Ron* */can/* *be presented with nuance in Harmony fics and sometimes is/./* It's more rare to see his POV, but I've definitely read quite a few fics with him as a major secondary character who reacts in something like the way you describe.
