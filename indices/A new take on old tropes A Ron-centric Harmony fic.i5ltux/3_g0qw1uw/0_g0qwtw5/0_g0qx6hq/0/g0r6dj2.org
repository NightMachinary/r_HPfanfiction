  Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. “It's no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, “she's a nightmare, honestly. ”

  Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she was in tears.

  “I think she heard you.”

  “So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. “She must've noticed she's got no friends.”

  Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron's disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Professor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again. She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things behind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater than Ron's just now, scooped up her remaining possessions and followed her.

  He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girls' bathroom on the floor below. She was accompanied by Luna Lovegood, who was patting her vaguely on the back.

  “Oh, hello, Harry,” said Luna. “Did you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?”

  “Hi, Luna. Hermione, you left your stuff. . . .”

  He held out her books.

  “Oh yes,” said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact that she was wiping her eyes on her pencil case.

  “This whole tournament's supposed to be about getting to know foreign wizards and making friends with them!” said Hermione hotly.

  “No it isn't!” shouted Ron. “It's about winning!”

  People were starting to stare at them.

  “Ron,” said Harry quietly, “I haven't got a problem with Hermione coming with Krum -”

  But Ron ignored Harry too.

  “Why don't you go and find Vicky, he'll be wondering where you are,” said Ron.

  “Don't call him Vicky!”

  Hermione jumped to her feet and stormed off across the dance floor, disappearing into the crowd. Ron watched her go with a mixture of anger and satisfaction on his face.

  “Come on, Hermione, come and have some food,” Harry said, looking over at Ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet.

  “I can't, Harry. I've still got four hundred and twenty-two pages to read!” said Hermione, now sounding slightly hysterical. “Anyway...” She glanced over at Ron too. “He doesn't want me to join in.”

  There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to say loudly, “If Scabbers hadn't just been eaten, he could have had some of those Fudge Flies. He used to really like them ---”

  Hermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or do anything, she tucked the enormous book under her arm, and, still sobbing, ran toward the staircase to the girls' dormitories and out of sight.

  “Can't you give her a break?” Harry asked Ron quietly.

  “No,” said Ron flatly. “If she just acted like she was sorry --- but she'll never admit she's wrong, Hermione. She's still acting like Scabbers has gone on vacation or something.”

  The Fat Lady and her friend Vi were snoozing in the picture over the portrait hole. Harry had to yell “Fairy lights!” before he woke them up, and when he did, they were extremely irritated. He climbed into the common room and found Ron and Hermione having a blazing row. Standing ten feet apart, they were bellowing at each other, each scarlet in the face.

  “Well, if you don't like it, you know what the solution is, don't you?” yelled Hermione; her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun now, and her face was screwed up in anger .

  Harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which Ron had chased him with a Beater's bat, but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream Ron for the real one, who was not only cold-shouldering Ginny and Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered Hermione with an icy, sneering indifference.
