Actually there is a lot of evidence suggesting that they actually enjoyed their bickering.

Most people associate arguing negatively, I mean and rightly so, shouting at each other isn't that romantic. But some people are just argumentative by nature, and enjoy a good debate, I know I do. And Hermione did too. Hermione is always seeking a good verbal spar; always picking fights wether it's over Lavander over her rabbit, Luna over her theories, Umbridge over Ministry rules, Professor Trelawney over Divination, Parvati also over Divination, and basically everyone over house elves. Because Hermione finds a good debate mentally stimulating, a way to use her intelligence, and a good, albeit not very productive, way to blow off steam and pent up anger.

Ron is also very argumentative. As he grew up with a big family, he doesn't necessarily associate arguments with negativity, unlike Harry who, growing up with the Dursley's, most definitely does. It's safe to assume that Ron's childhood was filled with him having to argue to get attention.

As for the evidence they enjoy their fights? Well it was said by Harry that they were constantly bickering, but most of the time, despite their constant bickering, they are fine in each other's company, remember when Ron and Hermione went to Hogsmede alone in the Prisoner of Azkaban and they returned 'looking as though they'd had the time of their lives.' and how whenever Harry would come back into the common room they'd always conveniently be sitting next to each other.

It's only when the argument hits close to home that they gets mad, and most of their squabbles would be like oh orange juice is better than apple juice or you should put the milk in before the cereal ( you should put milk after you weirdos, fight me ) and yet we never see them arguing over such trivial matters in detail, because those fights don't turn into screaming matches. Because most of their fights had no real anger behind them. So it is very likely they argue simply because they enjoy arguing.

Plus when Harry snaps and tells them to stop fighting they 'both froze, looking angry and offended.' Angry, not at each other, but at Harry for interrupting their fight, because they were enjoying it.

P.S : I don't ship Romione, I don't think they'd work in the long term, but not because of their arguing, but rather because they're both to stubborn and passionate.
