  Plus when Harry snaps and tells them to stop fighting they 'both froze, looking angry and offended.' Angry, not at each other, but at Harry for interrupting their fight, because they were enjoying it.

Just wanted to say that I've heard this interpretation of that scene several times, and I think it's really reading a lot into the text. Ron and Hermione are clearly mostly angry and offended because their best friend (Harry) suddenly yelled at them to "shut up." That's not a nice thing to do, and they're both a bit shocked. That's probably the most reasonable /surface level/ interpretation of what the text says there.

I think it's reaching quite a bit to claim they're offended because they were having a wonderful happy time, and I think it's often only an argument made by people who want to soften the negative interactions between Ron and Hermione. Sure, they may have fallen into a /bad habit/ of bickering, and they don't realize how annoying it is for others to hear. (That's certainly true of most of the bickering couples I've encountered.) But it's a quite different thing to say they /enjoy/ it.

Some people enjoy /debate/. That is, /respectful/ argumentation. Ron and Hermione are rarely very respectful to each other in their arguments, even when they're only having a "bickering" debate -- Hermione throws quite a few insults at Ron over the course of the books, and both tend to get testy. I know lots of people who enjoy a good (even heated) debate; I don't know anyone who /enjoys/ "bickering." (The dictionary definition of the word "bickering" carries with it a connotation of disrespectful quarreling about trivial things.)

But I agree with your post that JKR wants us to understand that Ron and Hermione clearly must enjoy being in each other's company. We're just very rarely shown why that is in text, while instead we see an emphasis on somewhat negative interactions.
