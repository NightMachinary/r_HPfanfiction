I'd never date my best friend in the first place, but I don't like the trope of "friends always argue or banter". I have my best friend who I've been in one fight with from age 12-20. 8 years, that's more than Hogwarts' time. Of course we don't always agree on everything, but we are extremely compatible hence being best friends. What we never do is scream at each other. Never have I once yelled at her or vice a versa. The one fight we did have was due to lack of communication when my dad was in the hospital dying and I felt like she wasn't there for me emotionally, but I was so upset I didn't even ask her for help I just talked to her on the phone for 2 minutes, said thanks, and hung up. Then the next day we cried in the school guidance counselors office together.

​

However, I do/did have another friend that I argued with all the time. We argued/bantered in good nature almost every day just like Ron and Hermione. In fact, my other friends have repeatedly said that we remind them of Ron and Hermione. Except the fact that neither of us would ever date because I would off myself if I was in a relationship with him. We've stopped talking recently and we had a huge huge months long argument over the new year that was just resolved in April which was very similar to Ron fighting Hermione about Scabbers or the Firebolt. But, we aren't the same as we used to be before that fight and I know that fight will always linger in our minds. This is most likely the same for Ron and Hermione. Who wants to argue and fight and scream at their friends or loved one? No one! And Ron screams at Hermione for no reason constantly, and then she cries and yells in retaliation. Of course Harry also raised his voice a few times in canon, but he's extremely mentally ill and no one ever recognizes that.

​

Long story short, in my opinion Romione will never work out in the long run due to lack of trust, anger issues, and how both sides get so worked up with each other. Sounds like a shitty relationship to me. (I don't ship Harmione either, so don't come at me for that.)
