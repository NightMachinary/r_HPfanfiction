I don't care enough to go pick quotes from canon again, but I'm pretty sure you are nitpicking. All the quotes you took are from scenes where Ron and Hermione are having their worst rows.

Outside of these, there are a lot of moments where they are arguing about minor subjects and where their friendship doesn't seem to be at stack at all. When Ron express his preference on girls in GoF, when Hermione express her disapproval of their Divination homework, or when she argues with him about how he broke the mood between Harry and Cho because of /Quidditch/.
