Since the downvoting brigade has already started (as I expected), let me again offer what seems to me an unnecessary qualifier: *I* */really like Ron as a character/* *in the books.* I like his complexity. I feel JKR did him no favors in his portrayal as an adult in the epilogue and in CC, which makes me disappointed. But it's what we have as evidence of Ron as adult, so we have to deal with it.

And I also am not a Hermione-defender. I repeatedly said her actions were "nasty." Ron and Hermione were both horrible to each other on quite a few occasions. I'm just trying to provide canon context, which I think is necessary to interpret actions.

But whatever. Downvote me to hell for providing canon evidence and JKR comments to back up my assertions, rather than meaningless speculation like most comments. Feel free to disagree and provide your own context if you'd like. I'm not saying mine is the only interpretation.
