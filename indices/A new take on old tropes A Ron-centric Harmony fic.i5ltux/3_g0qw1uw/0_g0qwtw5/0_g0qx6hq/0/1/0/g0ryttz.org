The idea that a couple enjoys rows is the result of media where it's a cheap and easy tool to add drama. IRL the benchmark of a good relationship is the ability to solve disputes without having to raise your voice, nevermind having an actual fight. If you ask the people with good relationships, they have fewer fights in a decade than we see Ron and Hermione have, if any.
