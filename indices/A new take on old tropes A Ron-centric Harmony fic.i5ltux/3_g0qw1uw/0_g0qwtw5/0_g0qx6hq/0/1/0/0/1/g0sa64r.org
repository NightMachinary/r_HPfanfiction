First off, I want to be clear that I do think it's possible for adult relationships to grow and change, so lots of things are possible, including for Ron/Hermione to sort things out eventually. However...

#+begin_quote
  Canon show their teenage years, where they have to learn how to deal with feelings and hormone, they are supposed to keep growing up even after the story end.\\
  Ron actions in GoF can be forgiven when he is a teenager, but an adult doing the same would be a man child at best and not someone positive to spend time with.
#+end_quote

You mean like cheating on your driver's exam by using magic illegally, and apparently /lying to your wife/ about it? Because that seems quite childish and is basically the /only/ thing we know about Ron from the Epilogue. (CC doesn't do Ron many favors either.)

#+begin_quote
  In the same way, it's one thing to forgive a 17 years old Hermione after what she did in HbP, but any adult acting the same should be put in front of a judge because she technically assaulted him.
#+end_quote

I hear this argument sometimes (and I don't disagree that Hermione's actions are nasty), but her actions need to be seen in context in the Wizarding world. HBP is also the place where we see Ron /throw a knife/ at Fred for joking about Ron's inability to attract women. And when Molly calls him on it and basically says, "Stop throwing knives at your brother!" Ron says she'll never /see him/ throw a knife at his brother again (implying he'll keep doing it). Violence is clearly quite common in the Wizarding world. In a place where healing spells can undo a lot of serious physical damage rather effortlessly and quickly, people sometimes take more extreme actions against each other. I think your idea that Hermione would be "in front of a judge" is clear hyperbole, as there's no evidence such actions would be taken in canon for such minor violence.

Again, not saying what Hermione does isn't nasty -- but it needs to be read in context of canon.

#+begin_quote
  I doubt adult Ron would be jealous about anyone taking Hermione to a ball (especially since he is supposed to be her date for all of them)
#+end_quote

Ron gets jealous and really acts awful in HBP because he finds out Hermione kissed Krum /two years earlier/. That's not normal jealousy. That's a level of rather obsessive possessiveness that /could/ lead to an unhealthy adult relationship. Sure, maybe he grows out of it, but canon evidence is Ron has rather irrational jealousy around Hermione. In DH when Hermione gets upset once and Harry seems like he's going to comfort her, Ron bounds up and snags his arm around her first, and then later he accuses Hermione of "choosing" Harry (with clear implication, based on the later Horcrux vision), even though the two of them have done nothing.

#+begin_quote
  I doubt Hermione would have to deal with another Lavender Brow (especially because it would become cheating).
#+end_quote

I have no idea how adult Ron would behave. CC implies Ron is still very much in love with Hermione, but he also admits there that he got so drunk on his wedding day that he doesn't remember saying his vows. Is that a one-off event, or could it become a pattern? People who get that drunk can behave erratically. We also have the setup for a marriage where Hermione is likely incredibly busy professionally (eventually becoming Minister) while Ron seems to have a much more lax work-schedule around running a joke shop. Aside from Hermione's excitement when Ron executes the basilisk teeth idea at the end of DH, there are precious few times in canon that we see Hermione actively praising or proud of Ron. JKR herself has said Hermione would have to work on being "less critical" of Ron in their relationship, and Ron would have to work on self-esteem.

You know the kind of relationship where cheating is likely? When one person doesn't appreciate the other so they go looking for affection elsewhere and where the first person is preoccupied with things like work while the other has the freedom to... well, do other things with his time.

I am NOT saying Ron would cheat. I'm saying the canon evidence we have and JKR's comments around their relationship kind of set up a scenario where cheating is more likely than in a more healthy equal relationship.

Again, to be clear, /maybe/ all of this could be worked out as adults. But I think you're significantly downplaying the potential red flags.
