I think "rows" is a term too strong for what Ron and Hermione do most of the time. I won't deny they have some of them (see the scenes quoted by KonoCrowleyDa), but outside of them, they mostly squabble.

Also, I don't think people should use canon events to judge their married life. Canon show their teenage years, where they have to learn how to deal with feelings and hormone, they are supposed to keep growing up even after the story end.\\
Ron actions in GoF can be forgiven when he is a teenager, but an adult doing the same would be a man child at best and not someone positive to spend time with. In the same way, it's one thing to forgive a 17 years old Hermione after what she did in HbP, but any adult acting the same should be put in front of a judge because she technically assaulted him.

Finally, I just want to point that the reasons for most of Ron and Hermione rows, or at least their worst ones (if we ignore Scabbers situation that should never happen again), is their difficulty to deal with their feeling for each other. I doubt adult Ron would be jealous about anyone taking Hermione to a ball (especially since he is supposed to be her date for all of them), and I doubt Hermione would have to deal with another Lavender Brow (especially because it would become cheating). So there is no reasons why they should have others "rows", though squabbles are fine.
