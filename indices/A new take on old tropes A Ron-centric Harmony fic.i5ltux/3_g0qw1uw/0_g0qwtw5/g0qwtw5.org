Yeah, I don't see Harry and Hermione working out long-term. They'd start out okay I think, but Hermione would get pissy that Harry wouldn't share everything with him, and Harry would ignore, deflect and eventually snap at Hermione when she inevitably bothered him too much. They care for each other but canon-wise it's just not a good fit. Ron and Hermione wouldn't work either, but they're at least friends-with-benefits/fling worthy.

Ron would have a better time away from Harry and Hermione, and his character could be so much more than the average Idiot!MoRon or Supportive Friend trope that is constantly put on him.
