What the stans don't get is that Harry and Ron would still be friends, but when Harry and Hermione hook up there would just be too many snide comments and arguing between them that'll strain the bond. Over the summer Ron will come to his senses, pick up some new hobbies and distance himself from Harmony, make some friends and re-establish his friendship with Harry. Kind of like the fourth year fight, but a bit longer. He'll become more fleshed out that way.

  And in many Ron is the supportive friend.

Yup, if he's not based or treated like an idiot, he's supportive and endlessly kissing ass. He's allowed to be angry and hurt for more than a chapter or two. Ron puts in a lot of effort emotionally in his friendship with Harry, and it's never really appreciated by anyone in-universe or out. That's why it's Ron-centric with a dash of Harmony. I want to see Ron's POV.
