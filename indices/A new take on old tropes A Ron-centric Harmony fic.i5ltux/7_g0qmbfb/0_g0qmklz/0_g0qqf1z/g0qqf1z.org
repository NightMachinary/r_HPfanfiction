Now, Harry/Hermione is not my cup of tea(sometimes because of the reasons you expounded) but I enjoy the odd gem here and there.

Many of the good ones have no bashing. And in many Ron is the supportive friend.

Ron is loyal to Harry, he would get sad, grumpy, but it would not stop him from helping Harry.

It may have made him more vulnerable to the pendant Horcrux though.
