Ron getting over someone who he's been crushing on since at least CoS (facing his greatest fear to save Hermione) by 4th or 5th year "quickly" is just not in-character. Ron's not the type of person to get over something quickly. He was hurt/angry about Victor nearly two years after he and Hermione went out in HBP, and most people with crushes that last longer than a year don't get over it fast (<6 months). If you are, kudos, but let's keep Fanon!Ron perceptions out of it okay?

+(It's also funny that the same Harmony stans that think Ron would "get over it quickly" are the same ones who like and favourite fics where Ron potions Hermione/fights with Harry for months on end. I really love the hypocrisy.)+
