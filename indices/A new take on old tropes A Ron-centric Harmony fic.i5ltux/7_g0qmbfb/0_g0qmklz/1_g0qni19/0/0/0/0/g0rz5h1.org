The big issue with this is that if both parties develop themselves into different directions, you end up with less and less of a friendship. There are other friends you'd rather hang out with, non mutual interests so you spend less time together - Basically, this is how a friendship dies in most cases. Not with an epic fight, but it simply fizzles out.
