heck yeah it should be done. In this fic, who would become Ron's new confident? Neville? Dean? Someone outside the Griffindor house? How will this new friendship effect Ron's outlook/beliefs/values? When/if he is ready to move on romantically, who would he be attracted to? Lavender? Susan? Luna? Pansy? (I once read a fic that had a side of Ron/Pansy and it one of the few times I didn't despise Ron's character in fanfic).

So many aspects to explore --the 'revenge scenarios' dreamed up by Hurt!Ron. Friends taking sides (and the one's who don't take any side).

Once you write, please post the link!
