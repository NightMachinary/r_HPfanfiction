Related to that is my prompt, which I have also never seen written well: Ron when staying in the Hospital Wing has a lot of time to think about his actions, and he comes to one overwhelming conclusion: his relationship with Lavender was a disaster. And not because he should just drop her and pick up Hermione, but he should stop being a pick and start treat Lavender as his potential life-long partner, and start their relationship better. And thus the story continues as Ron/Lavender done well.
