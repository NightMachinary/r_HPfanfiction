Honestly the only Harry/Hermione fic I've read from someone /else's/ point of view was a self-insert into Ron Weasley in an epically bad Ron Bashing fic(I don't generally have a problem with Ron Bashing, but I feel like the author took it too far in this fic)

<EDIT>

Basically, someone based a self-insert fic on one of RobSt's fanfics, where he ends up inside Ron's body.
