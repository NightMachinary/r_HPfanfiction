[[https://www.siye.co.uk][Sink Into Your Eyes]], a site dedicated to the Harry/Ginny pairing, has been around since /OotP/ was released in 2003 (if not earlier), so it's one of the oldest fansites that is still around (and yes, the main page still looks rather similar to [[http://web.archive.org/web/20030806010908/http://www.hgnetwork.co.uk:80/siye/][how it was back then]]). Its activity may have reduced somewhat, but compared to quite a few other sites that have been dropping like flies, it's still going strong.
