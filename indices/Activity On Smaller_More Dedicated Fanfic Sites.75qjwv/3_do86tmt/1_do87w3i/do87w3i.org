Yeah, DLP is harsh enough, but I think that's easy enough to deal with once you settle in with the lads. The only reason I don't post there is because I write a lot of gay characters, and DLP just isn't the place to publish if you write that sort of stuff, to be honest.

I definitely think the idea of DLP as like, a scary evil cave on the internet where everybody is gonna rip you apart is just... Bonkers.
