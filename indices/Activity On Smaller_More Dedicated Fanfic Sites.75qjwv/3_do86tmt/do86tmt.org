The smaller sites have been very welcoming, mostly (there are always some black sheep among the users). Since they're more tight knit communities, they end up being either extremely off-put by something they don't like, or incredibly happy to get more of the stuff they dig.

The most helpful community is definitely Dark Lord Potter, simply because you can expect to get somewhat thought out criticism and not just "OMG so great xD". But then again, DLP is a pretty harsh environment and some people misunderstand the "bring thick skin" disclaimer as a free-pass to be dicks.
