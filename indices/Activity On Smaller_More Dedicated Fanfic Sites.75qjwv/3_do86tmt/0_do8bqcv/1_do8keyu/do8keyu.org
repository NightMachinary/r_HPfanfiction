Yeah, I know. Writingprompts is, as a friend of mine once said, the "crime-series" of reddit. You have a pretty similar formula in almost every top-submission.

And DLP, yeah... They have a real good grasp on technical stuff. If you want to hone the /craft/ of writing, you're right there. But the moment it comes to the creative part, the /Art/ of writing, you may want to be careful what you give them. No forum is immune to the circlejerk and the bubble, and DLP is no exception.
