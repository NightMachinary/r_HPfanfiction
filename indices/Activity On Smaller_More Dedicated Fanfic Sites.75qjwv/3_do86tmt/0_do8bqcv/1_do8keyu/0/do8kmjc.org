Yeah, I'm not mad about it. It's great when like-minded people come together and foster the kind of stories that they like to read. And there's some awesome stuff from that community (like Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived).

It's just important that it is understood that - as you said - a high technical standard doesn't automatically mean the writing is going to be always great.
