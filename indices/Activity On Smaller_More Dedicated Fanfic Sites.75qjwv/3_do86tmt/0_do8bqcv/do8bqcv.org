  But then again, DLP is a pretty harsh environment and some people misunderstand the "bring thick skin" disclaimer as a free-pass to be dicks.

Eh, for all their complaints about cliches DLP is quite narrow minded. I can almost predict which kind of fic will be praised by DLP (bleak outlook, cynical protagonist, some kind of twist or mind-fuck - it reminds me a lot of the kind of stories that have been heavily upvoted on [[/r/WritingPrompts]] ... as if the whole point of any story is to undermine expectations somehow [*]). It feels to me purposely contrarian in a way and is just as boring as a cliche if I can expect the opposite. It's like a TV show where every episode ends on a cliffhanger... it kinda ruins the effect.

[*] Seriously, I just looked at the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/75lr85/wp_youve_accidentally_drowned_your_genie_after/do7faoy/][top comment]] in the top submission right now on that subreddit and it's exactly as I described... I promise I didn't cheat.
