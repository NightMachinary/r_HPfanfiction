I'd really love a Sirius-centric site too, actually!

The main thing I've noticed about Potions & Snitches is that like, they actually have tags for the different "kinds" of Snape characterisation - most of those kinds I would consider to be completely OOC, but it's actually a really great way for people to enjoy different fanfics without having to comb through characterisations they disagree with, like, and that's most certainly a problem I have with a lot of Sirius fics.

And surely he has a big enough fandom that it'd be sustainable, you know?
