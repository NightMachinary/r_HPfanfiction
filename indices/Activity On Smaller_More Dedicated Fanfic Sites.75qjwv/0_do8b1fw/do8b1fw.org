I would love to have found a site that was Sirius-centric to post my own stories on. They might have been more popular (also I might be deluded); but I don't think there is one. I'm surprised to hear AFF isn't just smut, perhaps I'll look there again.

I did have an unpleasant experience with DLP soon after I started writing so I wouldn't suggest going there unless you write a very particular type of story (the clue is in the name I suppose).
