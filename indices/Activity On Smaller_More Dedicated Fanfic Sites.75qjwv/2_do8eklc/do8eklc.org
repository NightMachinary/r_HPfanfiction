That's good to hear about AFF. When I was looking into posting, AFF was one of the places I looked at and to be honest, I can't remember why I decided not to post there. I'll have to look into it again. I'm definitely interested in a place that's more populated by adults.

Lack of meaningful reviews is one thing that frustrates me a bit on AO3. Sometimes I feel like I'm putting stuff out into a black hole and as a writer, I'm always looking to improve. I'd much rather have someone say they think a story is crap and indicate why they think it's crap rather just say nothing. This is a thing I need to work on myself when I read, so I suppose I'm in a bit of a glass house situation!
