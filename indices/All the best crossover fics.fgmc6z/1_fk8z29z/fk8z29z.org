Oh here are some others:

A Child Avenged [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4497336]]

(Short but very well done)

The Promise of a New Dawn [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/650264]]

(I don't recall any slash in this but my memory is a bit fuzzy. Apologies if there is.)

Harry Potter and The Dwarves of Erebor [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10747983]]

(Admittedly this isn't one of my favourites but that doesn't mean it isn't good. I'm putting this up here because while it wasn't something I loved, my friend would not stop talking about it for ages. (≧▽≦) )

Friend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1115333]]

(Short but sweet)

Only a Boy [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/398103]]

(Harry Potter isn't in this one. Set at Hogwarts though)
