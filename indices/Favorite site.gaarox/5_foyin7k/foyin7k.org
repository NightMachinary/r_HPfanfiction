I really only look at a handful of sites (I came late to the fanfiction world).

The sites i look at are

Fanfiction.net Hpfanficarchive Archive of our own Portkey-archive.org Fanficauthors Adult fan fiction

My two primary sites were hpfanficarchive and AO3 and that's mainly because I typically download the fics i'm interested in and i didn't have a decent downloader for fanfiction.net (I pretty much open my network connection, quickly do what i want, then immediately close the connection. So active on-line time is minimal)

AO3 is currently taking the lead over hpfanficarchive as there are more new stories and more updating stories. Plus the search functions are nicer.

If the search functions improved with fanfiction.net i would use that more.

If i like an author's work I first check out their other stories, then either the authors they like or the stories they like to expand to other authors (figuring if I like the one authors works there's a decent chance I'll like the authors/stories they like.

Boy that was a long winded explanation for a simple answer of AO3. Sorry about that.
