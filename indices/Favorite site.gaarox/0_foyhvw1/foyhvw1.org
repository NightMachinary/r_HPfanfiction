Ao3 for sure, and regardless of other differences the fact that pairings are tagged makes a world of difference. It drove me nuts that pairings weren't always marked on ffn. It's cool if the author wants it to be a surprise, but that's not the case for a lot of unmarked fics. I used to find fics by going through an author's favorites because the search function was frustrating.

However, Ao3 seems to have way less canon dominant pairings so I imagine for the hardcore Hinny readers that a site design is somewhat irrelevant. (idk the stats for background pairings). I read pretty much everything except harem, Harry/older man and Harry/Ron so that's why I'm especially thankful for the clearly marked pairings- both romantic and gen.

Sorting by kudos yields better results than sorting by favorites because a reader is more likely to hit the "kudos" button than actually favorite a fic imo. Ao3 was a bit overwhelming when I first wandered over there from ffn, but once I figured out how to utilize the site controls for my benefit I never looked back.
