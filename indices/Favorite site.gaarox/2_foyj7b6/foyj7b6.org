I used to solely use Ao3 but then stuff happened and I couldn't access it as easily, which lead me to have an appreciation for ffnet. The little communities are good when you're looking for a specific genre or trope. And since the website is older than ao3, you have some really intresting things written post all the books releases. Not to mention, it seems to have more written works on general, though (correct me if I'm wrong) I think that stories are abandoned more on ffnet.

Of course the tagging system on ao3 is a godsave, but it's quite tedious-- for example, if I filter results to remove explicit, then I don't get any plotless smut. But then I might miss out on a good story with one or two mature scenes that I could've skipped. And then theres the overtagging thing too.

I think that both sites have their uses, but I mostly use ffn, after having scoured ao3 for a few months. Especially because I only read hp fanfics. But ao3 has way more abo. /shudders/ but it also has more slash, which I prefer.

Honestly I just get my recommendations on this sub and read it on whatever website it's on.
