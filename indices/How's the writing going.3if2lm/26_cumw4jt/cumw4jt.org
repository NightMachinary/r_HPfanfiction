Ugh. Lousy. I signed up for three fests because having a firm deadline is the only way I actually get anything written anymore, but while I know where I want the story I'm currently working on to go, every time I sit down to write, the words disappear from my head! It's very frustrating. And it's the only one of the three I actually have plotted, and all are due between two weeks from now and the end of October. :/
