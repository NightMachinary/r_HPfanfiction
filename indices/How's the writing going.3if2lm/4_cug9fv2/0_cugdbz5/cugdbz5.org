Write out the conversation without worrying about how people talk- just get the rhythm of it down and make sure you're hitting all the points you need to cover.

Then (and this is the part many beginning writers miss) go back through the conversation, concentrating on one character's lines- do they sound right for their age/education/background/knowledge? The biggest pitfall is not checking that someone is talking about something they wouldn't know about.

For each character, pare down or add to the wording so it sounds more like them. This is especially useful for Hagrid, the Delacours and house-elves.
