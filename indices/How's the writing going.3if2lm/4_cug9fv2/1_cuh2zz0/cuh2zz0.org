To add to wordhammer's advice, if you find it hard to think about all those qualities of a character, try a visual aid. Bring up images of people - celebs are easiest - who look like your characters and see if you can imagine your dialogue coming out of their mouth.

For me, I say all of my dialogue out loud. I've acquired a really bad British accent as a result.
