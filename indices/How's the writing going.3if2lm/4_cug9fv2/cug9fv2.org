It's going with ups and downs. Just had a lot change in my personal life, so updates have been on hold for the past 2.5 months. I've just started continuing my first and only (thus far) fanfiction. I'm pretty excited about the story though. As my first story, I was extremely nervous about the reception, especially since the premise of the story has some clichés (wrong BWL, abused by Dursleys and different name) which can put people off. But, I've been told I did them rather well and didn't fall in any pitfalls like illogical reasoning and straight up bashing. Which comforts me, because I like those clichés but I've often found them poorly written, completely over the top and illogical.

Now I'm barely passed 60k words and have nearly 1.5k follows and more than 1k favourites, which I find a good accomplishment for my first fanfiction as a non-English writer ,and it's a huge motivator to continue writing.

My current troubles are writing natural conversations. Not sure if it's just my perspective as an author, but it's difficult to write good conversations that don't feel forced, especially for eleven year olds. Which makes me somewhat regret not having the story start in fourth-year like I was tempted to do at first, but I didn't want the story littered with flashbacks. The plot is going along nicely, I've figured out enough for at least 200k words, the only thing now is putting all those thoughts in actual content.

Anyone got any tips on how to write good dialogues?
