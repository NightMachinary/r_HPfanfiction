I'd say I'm a perfectionist when it comes to writing. While this did great works writing essays and the likes, when it comes to free literature writing, it means that I'm never happy with what I write. It's never good enough, ever.

Even if my writing skills were on par with a truly skilled wordsmith like King, I'm fairly sure I'd still be dissatisfied with my writing. And as a non-native amateur, it's a recipe for disaster.

Anyway, I have a single paragraph of a Naruto story written. I'm happy with the paragraph. It took me several hours to write. This story isn't going anywhere, and I keep this paragraph as a reminder.

For a HP story I haven't yet decided upon what it's really going to be about, I've written 10 pages on a compendium on various knowledge for the AU world, I've written a scene where Grindelwald speaks to his followers after returning (I'm still not happy with it - writing a master orator without any particular speechcraft skills is hard, and even lifting some lines from our friend Adolf hasn't helped much,) so I'll probably drop that, too.

I've also got a time-line for a rough European war involving both wizards and muggles, which I'm definitely not happy with - trying to find a plausible way to integrate into muggle warfare, and vise versa, is really bloody hard. How Marquis Black ever did it will forever amaze me - I did lift the idea to remove nuclear weaponry from the equation from him though, it helped a lot.

I have a few chapters of a fic that starts out as a Renegade Cause clone and then spirals wildly, but I'm not particularly happy with it. About the time I had Harry become a terrorist in an effort to appease a nazi veteran so he could get to one of Voldemort's horcruxes, I realized I had no clue what I was doing and my plot was ridiculous. That story is probably dead too.

A week ago I got the idea to just write scenes I wanted to write, roughly label the date in the timeline it occurs and try to build a library that I can later compile for a story. I have this;

- 1993 - 09. September - Harry duels Dean Thomas in DADA
- 1995 - 22 September - Hermione awakens the Elder Ones
- 1996 - 09.September - Harry fights Theodore Nott in the dungeon
- 1996 - 12.December - Harry participates in the Berlin Yule Coup

I'm still not sure what causes the AU - I for sure want to make the Diary piece take residence in Harry's scar and absorb the other Horcrux there (this has to be my favourite trope!), but I'm trying really hard to keep Riddle /Riddle/, manipulative, cold and uncaring.

As it turns out, having a genius with 60 years of experience really makes manipulating a teenager rather easy.

Essentially, I want to have this as a multi-POV epic where I do all I can to avoid characters acting stupidly and falling into classic fantasy failings.

Every character has aspirations and goals and will do what they can to achieve them, even if it infringes on the "master plot". Voldemort won't decide to become an idiot and a magical imbecile that can only use one spell just so Harry can triumph on a technicality. Just a weenie bit of the skill he showed against Dumbledore in OOTP would have crushed Harry in Hallows, protections or not. After so many failings, any intelligent character would just squash Harry indirectly or have someone else do it.

It's really hard though. How can Harry be relevant in a world that doesn't revolve around him? He'd be outclassed totally by so many players.. and this is true, and my greatest challenge. If anyone has any ideas on how to improve that, I'd gladly hear them. For now my plan is that Riddle wants to "help" Harry destroy /evil/ Voldemort and helps him gather the Horcruxes. I think you get what horcrux Riddle wants to do.

I'm considering reusing the terrorist plotline and have a horcrux be placed inside Grindelwald's bunker, which was, after Voldemort placed it there, sealed by some of Grindelwald's followers and for some reason I've yet to flesh out be impossible to break open. Thus, Harry would need to convince them to let him inside. Cue Wizarding SS Officer Harry Potter further on. I've never seen a pretty-much-a-nazi!Harry, and it'd be interesting to explore his character essentially being forced into this. Also, Grindelwald as a player and an ally (or master..?) of Harry would level the playing field a great bit.

And it'd be a great motivator for a larger scale war, too.

Anyway, I'm struggling a lot with actually writing this - there's so much empty room to be filled, characters that needs to be built.. Multi-POV is a great amount of work - for example, I doubt my Hermione will get into interesting things before in fifth year, but I still need to build her character before that and show her changed experiences.

With a probably Slytherin!Harry sorting, I see Hermione being all alone and +possibly+ bullied - a completely asocial Hermione with no attachments seems like a great springpad for interesting storytelling.

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QYJaylTQdAPBr8dy2gVWTt5sGUfvVukDmcDl2guf4LA/edit?usp=sharing][Here]] is my drafts for the two duels I've written - I don't feel either is particularly good, and I'd appreciate any feedback greatly. If you have any ideas on how I can make the outline above less titanic to try and tackle, that'd be great, too.
