That's super ambitious! You might be encouraged if you find a writing buddy to trade ideas and critiques with. You did a good writeup of your idea here. There might be someone on the sub who's interested in doing that. It's ok to "shop around" for writing buddies, too; not everyone fits. Try it out with a few casual chats. Also, I skimmed the drafts. I'm not the audience for fight scenes, but I'll that you might want to watch out for unnecessary description and adverbs. Kill your darlings and keep the best description. It makes the fight scene go quicker. On that note, not everything has to be a complete sentence and experimenting with styles can make the scene more dynamic.

Since it's so huge, work on this fic one arc/story at a time. You've got an idea of what happens later, but things change, especially as you develop as a writer. JKR didn't plan out HP entirely either when she started. There is no point is plotting out every detail of twentieth chapter if you cannot finish writing the fifth. Actually writing is the hardest part of writing.

Allow yourself some mistakes and retcons. Our most popular media is rife with mediocre bits, including HP. Since your project is ambitious, sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and go, "oops, gonna go back and edit this characterization" or "oops, dropping this subplot out of nowhere." I'm a perfectionist too, but I try to be a practical perfectionist. Think about how much you complain about things you love and how you still love them anyway. Give yourself that same space.
