One of my favorite moments as a writer was when I finished my previous next gen, because the very ending is that kind of scene, where I'd been waiting to write it for two years. It was the easiest thing to write, more perfect on paper than I could have imagined, and I'm still happy when I reread it even if I would tweak a sentence here or there now ;)

That's super super exciting! I hope to make this topic a bi-weekly/monthly sort of thing, so you can post an update then :D After answering the subreddit survey, I figured if I want more topics for authors, I can start by making them myself.
