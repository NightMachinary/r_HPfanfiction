Hmm, well, let's see if this helps - I find British speech to be more understated than American speech. Sometimes, it occurs via word choice, other times tone, but I feel like Americans in general tend to be more upfront about how they feel when it comes to speech - it's much more obvious if the person is upset or happy or whatever. I mean, it's still there in British speech, but it's not as noticeable, especially compared to American speech.
