Hey, you've already done the hardest part! Actually writing :D I see quite a few grammar errors - run-ons, incorrect punctuation, incorrect verbs and such; I don't know if this is a first draft thing, but take note if you haven't. Like the first sentence of chapter 1:

#+begin_quote
  It was still well before dawn when Hermione rose and showered, slipping into sober, navy blue robes and shoes and taking extra care with her hair, smoothing it into a low chignon, even adding a touch of lipstick today.
#+end_quote

is saying that she put on her robes and shoes while showering, and it sounds like the lipstick is applied to her hair. It's also generally confusing.

And look up resources on how to "show not tell", which I know is vague advice, but I can try to elaborate with some examples.

#+begin_quote
  She patted the wand at her waist in the way that was the habit of years
#+end_quote

What is the way that makes it seem like the habit of years?

#+begin_quote
  Hermione knew he was afraid
#+end_quote

How?

#+begin_quote
  The memorial service had gone well she thought, Kingsley spoke eloquently but, as always, it was Harry the crowd came to see.
#+end_quote

This sentence contains redundant information. You can leave it as "Kingsley spoke eloquently but, as always, it was Harry the crowd came to see" which is the more showy part.

And of course, there's always a balance. Telling isn't a sin; it's very good for getting through unimportant information (No need for "Kingsley spoke with the blessed voice of gods" unless it's relevant!). But lengthy bouts of telling are tedious. Showing is better at building scenes, managing pacing, and directing focus on what's important. Note: showing isn't just tacking on a bunch of adjectives either. It's definitely a style thing though, so it'll develop as you write!
