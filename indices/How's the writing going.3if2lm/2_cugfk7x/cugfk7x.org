I am sticking to my weekly update schedule for "Patron", and doing the August 2015 "fic a day challenge" from Twistedshorts with a Castle/Buffy crossover. So far I've managed to post 1500 word updates each day. I'll probably slow down a bit on that in September, since 20K words per week are a bit much to keep up.
