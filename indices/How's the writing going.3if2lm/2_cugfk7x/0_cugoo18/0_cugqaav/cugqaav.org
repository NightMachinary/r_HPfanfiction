The Castle crossover is a lot of fun to write, and the smaller chunks needed means there's less pressure. linkffn(Richard Castle, Watcher)

It starts in 1989 though (and just recently, after 25 updates, reached the start of the Castle TV series), so Castle's theories are actually more like experiences. Not that the crew from Castle will know that for some time.
