I can't seem to complete the next chapter for my Honks fic. While it's sat at 1000 words I've written several one shots for the competition I'm in, I've started and nearly completed a Harry/Pansy love/hate fic, and I've written a bit of a sequel to my only completed long fic to date.

But every time I try to write my Honks I get nowhere at all.
