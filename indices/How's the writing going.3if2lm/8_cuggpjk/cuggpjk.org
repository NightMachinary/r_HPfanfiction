Ginaa, as you know my whole fanfic career is a haitus! Current writing is particularly glacially slow, since the only time I have is between classes and on the bus ride back to my apartment.

I have a new time travel fanfic in the drafts, but most of my efforts are focused on OF at the moment, which is about - well, it's a gothic horror about rivaling cousins, romani mythology (ESP abilities) , and the motif of cyclic history. It's the creepiest thing I've by far ever written. I just hope it's worthy of a ban someday too.
