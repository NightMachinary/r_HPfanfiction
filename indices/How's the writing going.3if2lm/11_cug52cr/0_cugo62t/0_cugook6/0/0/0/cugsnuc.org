Sure :) I don't really post about it here because my current story is about as unrelated to HP as it gets; I make an effort to involve the world though, as it's just my style to despite the genre. It's actually my most popular fic right now, too. It started as a satire of next gen romcoms and became an elaborate commentary of fandom, mob mentality, and the media. It reads like a mature contemporary YA. The beginning is still kind of bad, but I can't be bothered to edit because I'm rewriting it into an original when I'm done.
