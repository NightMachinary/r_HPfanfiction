This is my little story: linkffn(11346410)

And I'm pretty stuck right now. Not because I don't know how this story should continue - no, because I can't, for the life of me, finish the next chapter in a satisfying manner. Tomorrow marks the day when I wrote longer on this one chapter than all 5 before combined.

My typical tactic, writing something different until the muse kisses me, doesn't help here apparently.

Also, turns out making a videogame is fucking hard work. My Master Project takes a lot of time and I had to cut back on the writing.
