As has been said many times already, could be better.

I'm sitting on a finished chapter. Well... technically finished. It's always like this at the end of the month: you're five per cent away from updating, and all of a sudden, the downstairs toilet explodes.

The leak gets fixed, and you clean the poop on the floor, but there might have been a juicy bit of fruit hidden in that poop, and you might have overdone it on the air freshener. You spend the rest of the night in a foetal position, weeping and gnashing your teeth while repeating the mantra "I AM /NOT/ A PROFESSIONAL!" in your head.

Rinse and repeat. It'll be just like this next month. But it's rewarding. :)
