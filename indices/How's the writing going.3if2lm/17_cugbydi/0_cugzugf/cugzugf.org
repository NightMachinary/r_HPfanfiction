LOL, too apt, too apt. I think it was a few years into fic writing when I began to expect and embrace the terrible cycle of chapter updates - staring at a blank page, hating every word, forgetting to eat until I finish a scene, the catharsis of posting the damn thing, spending the rest of the night refreshing for reviews - that I felt like a real writer, when I never identified as one before. It's kind of like exercise mantras - no pain, no gain. You need a little masochism for these hobbies.
