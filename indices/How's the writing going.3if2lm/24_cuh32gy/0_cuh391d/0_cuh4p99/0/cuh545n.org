Hmm, then I'd suggest trying one of the above! Writer's block is common, and treating it is like treating a cold. You can try a little bit of everything and eventually it goes away. Read a book or other fic and focus on how they write, write something entirely different - something short you can finish in a night, make an inspiration board, or just do something else entirely and come back to your story a little later.
