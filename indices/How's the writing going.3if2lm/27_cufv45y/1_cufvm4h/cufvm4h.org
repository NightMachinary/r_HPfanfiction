Horrible things to do to characters I love? Easy. Horrible things to do to the awful ones? Yeah, I got nothing.

I made peace a long time ago with how ridiculous some of things that happen in my stories are. I set out to let my fic be 'fun' and the free reign I let myself have with it has produced some of my best writing. Sometimes you have to give up plausibility if it means you can create better things out of it.
