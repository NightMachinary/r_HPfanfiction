The wording may have been inexact; my problem is that the school should feel locked down and oppressed by Umbridge even more than normal administrative oversight, but Harry is moving around more freely than ever, making it hard to escalate- how often can Harry be tortured before Umbridge should have enough cause to just expel him?

Upon reconsideration, it might be the ultimate defiance for Harry to be getting a rep as a sex pirate despite her chronic oppression. After all, a rep isn't reality.
