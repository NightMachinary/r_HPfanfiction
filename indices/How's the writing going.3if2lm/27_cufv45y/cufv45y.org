Ever get stuck looking for something horrible to do to a character but you're just not feeling it? Whether for or against Umbridge, I'm just stuck.

That's not the big problem, though. The big problem is the sex thing. Love writing it, but sometimes it doesn't seem plausible that Dumbledore (or at least McGonagall) would allow for witches to hook up with the Chosen One without punishment.

At the same time I'm balancing on a dangerous edge when it comes to taking Ginny into the adult realm. For Hermione, she's almost a year older than Harry and already acts more mature than the rest, but Ginny...

Y'know what? Fuck it. Story charges forward.
