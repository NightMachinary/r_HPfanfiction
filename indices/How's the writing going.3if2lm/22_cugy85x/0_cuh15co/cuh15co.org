Do you think Draco would be a show off? Sort of like how he tried to impress Harry initially. He managed to get cronies early in Hogwarts. Do you think he'd get it in his head that he'd have to show this girl the ropes and recruit her into his inner circle? If she's hostile, what are her weak spots? Is she lonely or curious or naive (I love the combination of pride hiding naivety)?
