I've hit a snag. I'm writing a story about the daughter of Rodolphus and Bellatrix Lestrange. Kreacher took her when her parents were captured and then she went on to live in Grimmauld with the elf and the paintings (+Walburga for the first five years) The whole world thinks she'd died.

I've finished all of the pre-Hogwarts stuff (Prologue, home life, Diagon Alley, etc) but now that I've reached Hogwarts, I'm not entirely sure what to do. I want her to develop a friendly relationship with Draco because she has to be invited to Malfoy Manor for Christmas in order for the next big plot point to play out but she's quite a hostile person and Draco's a wimp, they just don't fit together all too well.

I could have Draco inviting her on his mother's orders, but then I'm not certain how I would write that either.
