I can't help your self-esteem, but I can say that all writers struggle with their writing and all writers have written terrible things. There will be people who love your story and people who hate it, regardless of how popular or well-regarded it is. Some people can't deal with that, and if you're not passionate about improving your writing, then that's okay. Criticism (from yourself or others) is not an easy thing to take; seasoned pros can have a hard time dealing with it, too. But I'd look on the bright side, knowing there are some people out there who will enjoy your story, and you will improve. It's a grueling initial curve to good writing, but you'll get there. I hope you can find some fun in writing, or find a medium you feel more confident in to tell your stories :)
