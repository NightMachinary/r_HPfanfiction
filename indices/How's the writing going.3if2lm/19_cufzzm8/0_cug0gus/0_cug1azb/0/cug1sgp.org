You just described a pretty cool scene in summary. Would either of them really go through with the act of hurting the other, though? Or is it more of a threat, a way of saying 'don't mess with me' and protecting themselves, rather than an aggressive 'I want you to suffer by my hand'? Focus on what they want and what they're willing and unwilling to do to get it. If he's a coward, he has a backing off point. If either of them are scared of causing real harm or getting expelled, there's a backing off point.
