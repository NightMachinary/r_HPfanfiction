She's the (adopted) daughter of Severus Snape, a dhampir, and she just called him 'wolf'. Either one of those things are enough for him to not back down that much. I basically want this incident to make it clear to the reader why they both instantly dislike the other. It will also be another reason for Snape to talk about werewolves when he takes over one of Lupin's lessons, making him a bit less petty in this story.

I do plan on them eventually coming to a truce, but this will after an incident that nearly kills both of them. They will never really like each other though.
