I'd shift the tone- Remus realizes he's being petty but also that the current situation is a student threatening their teacher. He has the weight of school authority to back him up, but it sounds like he started the problem (which already is out of character unless it's nearly a full moon). So he would shift into official-speak and dismiss her, warning that weapons can be more provocative than reassuring to others so she should leave them in her trunk.
