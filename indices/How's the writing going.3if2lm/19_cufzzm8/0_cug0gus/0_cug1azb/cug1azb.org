My main problem is that I'm not a great writer, so both. I have plenty of plotbunnies in my head and elaborate worlds that appear, both original and fandom, but writing them out in a way that's enjoyable to read proves hard.

I see Remus as a kind but often cowardly soul in canon. And dangerously neglectful in the third book. In my story Dhampirs often act as monster hunters, hunting monsters for bounties and/or body parts (werewolves' pelts), so when he meets my OC he isn't too fond of her and starts harassing her in class.

I'm currently in the confrontation after class, he's just tried to summon any and all weapons she's carrying from her, and now they're standing alone in a classroom, he has his wand and her dagger pointed at her, she has her long knife pointed at him. She has her wand but not in her hand yet. Basically they're in a bad situation that I wanted them in, but now I have to get them out of it in a realistic manner.
