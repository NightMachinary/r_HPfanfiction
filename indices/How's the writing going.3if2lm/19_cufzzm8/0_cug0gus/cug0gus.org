Are you struggling with the dialogue or pacing? I currently have the opposite problem with chapters that want to be confrontation after confrontation; isolated one-on-ones are one the cruxes I actively avoid (along with metaphors involving food - quirk of mine). I can imagine that kind of Remus being interesting! I'm imagining someone who's discriminated against having discriminatory views as well out of resentment, like "vamps deserve to be treated as badly or worse than I am."
