Confrontations are hard... inner musings as well as describing actions are so much easier. My protagonist is a dhampir and currently in a confrontation with Remus, and I generally like Remus but in this story he will be a bit of a @$%! which makes it rather hard to write. Also keeping him from being too OOC is hard while emphasizing that vampiric creatures and werewolves don't get along at all.
