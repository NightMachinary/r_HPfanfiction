  Lorcan McLaird was born no later than 1906, somewhere in the British Isles. His surname suggests he was Scottish, or had Scottish ancestry. In his youth, he attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he was Sorted into Ravenclaw. McLaird rose to the office of Minister for Magic of Great Britain and Ireland in 1923. He was quite a talented wizard, but was considered something of an eccentric, as he liked to communicate by puffing smoke from the tip of his wand. Eventually, he was forced out of office in 1925 due to irritation at his eccentricities.\\
