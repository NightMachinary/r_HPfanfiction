I'm working on a couple of stories. I'm thinking that they're going to be connected in some way. I'm currently working on a Teddy/Gabby (yes, you read that right) one shot. It wouldn't be that hard to connect it to the other story that I've been working on.

There's actually another unrelated story that is almost complete aside from editing. I should get around to making a FF.net account. It takes place in the 1920's and vaguely concerns the father and uncle of everyone's favorite dark lord. It's about then Minister of Magic Lorcan McLaird ([[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Lorcan_McLaird][see his wiki page]]) meeting Calvin Coolidge in the British Prime Minister's office.

I'm also tinkering with the idea of a fic involving Hagrid and Filch's resistance during /HP and the Deathly Hallows./ I have an idea of how I want to portray Filch, but it still needs some work.
