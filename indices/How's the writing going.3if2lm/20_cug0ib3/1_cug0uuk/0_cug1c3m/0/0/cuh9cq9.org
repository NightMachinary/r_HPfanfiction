I'm definitely planning on going back and reading through Hagrid-heavy chapters to get a feel for how he talks. I wouldn't say that Hagrid would be excited for most of the story, so that would help keep the amount of Hagrid-dialogue to a minimum.

I finally sent the copy of my "political" story to myself so I could use MS Word's word counter. It's actually only about 500 words. Apparently I can't estimate.
