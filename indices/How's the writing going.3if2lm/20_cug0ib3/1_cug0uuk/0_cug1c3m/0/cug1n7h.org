Awesome, short enough for me to check out :D

Fanon can redefine things. Filch is a minor enough character that I'd be open to odd characterizations of him, if it's properly set up. Hagrid, though, that accent might make or break you :P I finally got my HP set in my apartment; I'd probably read his passages out loud to prep for writing him (Related: I have a really bad habit of slipping into a Brit cadence in /all/ of my writing because I say all of my dialogue out loud while writing fic). But I also don't see him as excessively talkative except when he's desperate or excited--too many run ins with authority. Maybe you can get away with a lot of inner narration!
