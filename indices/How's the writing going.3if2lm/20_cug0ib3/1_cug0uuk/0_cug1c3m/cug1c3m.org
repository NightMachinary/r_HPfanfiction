It's not really that political, to be honest (it would be hard to do that in I think about 2k words or so); it just involves politicians.

There's a lot of things that can be done with Teddy. ;)

Filch is going to be difficult. I don't want him to seem too OOC, but he won't be like the Filch that everyone knows. It's nice that we don't really know what he was up to for most of DH. There will be reasons for his actions. I'm not sure if I want to post the (as of yet uncompleted) bio of Filch before or after I release the story I have planned. Hagrid's accent is going to be awfully difficult though. With him as a main character, that is a big part (the other big factor being the other stories I have in progress) of why I haven't even started it.
