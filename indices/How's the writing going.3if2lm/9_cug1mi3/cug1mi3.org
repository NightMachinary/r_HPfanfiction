I'm tryin to figure out lunch. And how much gets accomplished that afternoon. I know what i'll want to have done in the next couple days, before they leave town. but they're there for a couple days, with things in a 'handled for now but we're waiting on some things' situation. and how much detail i want for that time- i think i could easily just overword things and ramble off topic.
