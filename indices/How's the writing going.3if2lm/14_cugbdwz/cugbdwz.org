I have a few stories going right now that I never plan to publish.

My writing style leaves a lot to be desired. I know from years of reading fics that bad fanfiction is bad and I refuse to contribute with something that I know is just mediocre.

So why do I write it? One day I just got tired of not finding the exact kind of story I wanted to read so I decided to just write it myself.

One story I'm writing that's pretty fun is one where Draco and Harry are both competing for Hermione's affections and she is torn between the two. I'm pretty far along but I'm having a hard time coming up with what should happen next in that story so I haven't written in a while. I just need to sit down and work out a new outline but I just haven't put forth the effort.
