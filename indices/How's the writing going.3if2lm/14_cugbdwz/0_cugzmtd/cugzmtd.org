  One day I just got tired of not finding the exact kind of story I wanted to read so I decided to just write it myself.

That's exactly why I started writing and why I continue to write! I was tired of seeing heroines I could not relate to.

I know I'm leaving a lot of cheesy encouragement in this thread but: everyone is terrible at writing at first, and no one makes great things until the world intimately knows their mediocrity. So don't think of your writing as contributing to the crap; think of it as preparing to contribute something great. Your fic sounds fun! I hope you find some inspiration.
