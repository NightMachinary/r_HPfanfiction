  I'm two chapters to the end of a novel and I haven't updated in... four months!

This exactly! I have one chapter left on one of my fanfics and I just can't get past it. It also doesn't help that when I get stuck on a chapter I always end up writing anything but...so incidentally I've drafted out a new fanfiction, which I refuse to post until I've finished the other story...sigh.
