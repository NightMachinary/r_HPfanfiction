I write ficlets for my HP headcanon blog when I need to just write /something/. It hasn't been updated recently though, because I've actually been trying to update this! frustrating! fic! I did get over the worst hill, though, I think. The rest of the chapter is partially wirtten.

And I'm the same with not starting new fics until old ones are complete. I can't bear incomplete fics myself, and it just divides my attention. It fosters a good work ethic, I think.
