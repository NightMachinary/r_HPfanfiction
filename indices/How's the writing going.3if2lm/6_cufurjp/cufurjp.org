I'm two chapters to the end of a novel and I haven't updated in... four months! I'm in a perpetual state of guilt. It's my last hurrah for novel-length fic, as all my future writing projects are original. But I'll still be posting short fic for, I don't know, the rest of my life probably. I've got too many ideas and not enough monkeys on typewriters.
