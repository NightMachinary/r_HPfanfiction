I never ever ever like my beginnings. For all of my novels, there's at least a two year gap between my first chapter and last chapter, and it shows, even after editing. I know it's because I tend to use my first chapters to explore my own characters for myself so it sounds wishy washy and I haven't nailed down my subplots yet. If I really wanted to edit, I'd chop off the first 20k of every novel and redo it entirely. For me, good beginnings are a second draft thing, but by that point, I've moved on from the story!
