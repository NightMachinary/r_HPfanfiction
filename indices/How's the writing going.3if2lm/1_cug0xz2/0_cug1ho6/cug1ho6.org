YOU GO! The first leap is the hardest. The first six months I wrote fic in earnest, I swore I would stop writing as soon as I finished my first story. It's been five years. Everyone thinks old writing is terrible, but look at it as how far you've come. You can't get to where you are today without covering all that past ground, and for that, be proud.

Finishing a story is one of the most exciting things! They're definitely a commitment with highs and lows, and making a story feel complete thematically is much more than crunching out words. KEEP WRITING is really the best advice as grueling as it sounds; I explain a bit more [[http://oddhour.tumblr.com/post/91667086429/keep-writing][here]] (because I don't like that advice on its own). I hope you can push to that point for one of your longer stories.

Also, canon is overrated in my opinion ;) I think you should do whatever services /your/ story best. Maybe try going wildly off path with how you're thinking about the story (what happens if tragedy strikes elsewhere; if someone betrays in desperation etc ); sometimes you get absurd but amazing ideas that actually fit with your plans.
