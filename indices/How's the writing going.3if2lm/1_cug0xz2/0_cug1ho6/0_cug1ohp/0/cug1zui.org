Trust me, there's an entire subset of fandom that is only interested in very non-canon things :D Me personally, if I want canon, I'd read the books. I'm in fanon for the what-ifs, original ideas, and the stories we don't see. Canon characterization and following the spirit of the book is usually all I need.

A work is not lesser for not following canon, because canon is not the end-all, be-all. It's the inspiration, not to mention that canon can be deficit. When you write, you've created a new work on its own. It can be, but does not have to be, limited by the source material.
