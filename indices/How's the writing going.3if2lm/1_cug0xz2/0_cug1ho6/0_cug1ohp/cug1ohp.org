I will! :D It was probably the most amazing feeling in the whole world when I got my first comment, and then a few days later got /another/ comment complimenting me on the series I was writing so far. The thought of someone actually visiting my profile and waiting for me to put up something new was just... gah. ; ; <3

That link was great, thanks!

I think the nice thing about trying to work with canon at first, is that I tend to start thinking really out of the box in terms of plot points to try to get my stuff to seem coherent. I think you've made me more comfortable with the idea that I can diverge from canon even if it's just a little bit, because who's to say Voldemort didn't somehow learn you only had to disarm the owner of the Death Stick so Snape didn't have to die?! /Ahem./ So yeah, thank you. :3
