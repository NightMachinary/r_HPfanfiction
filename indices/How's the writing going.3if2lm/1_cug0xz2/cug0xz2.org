So I finally made an account on AO3 after ages and ages of writing fics and not finishing them, or hiding them from everyone because I was terrified that I'm an awful writer and no one will like my work. I decided to start doing one shots because I always start something intended to be long and then never finish it, so I put out a bunch of short stories in the past week and I COULD NOT BE MORE EXCITED to actually feel like I'm accomplishing something other than just mental exercise.

However, now all of my long fics have once again taken to the back burner and I'm not sure if I'll ever finish one. .-. Bleh. I just start thinking about "oh god how is this fic supposed to end?" because one of the main characters is supposed to die or canon wouldn't work out properly if I didn't kill off the OC... it's so daunting. ; ;
