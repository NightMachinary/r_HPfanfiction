I'm trying to promote a more positive vibe in the sub exactly to counteract that discouraging feeling! Complaining is fun, but we've been having a needless amount of those threads, and it has consequences like discouraging new authors. People are pretty good about saying everyone has different taste here, but I still see a lot of unpopular interests (slash and such) downvoted for no reason at all. I don't like most things rec'd here - heck, I don't read anything with Harry as a lead - but I'm not contributing anything by downvoting people who want to read that. I'm active here because I want to make sure people who have more obscure interests in the fandom feel welcome.

And definitely write what you want to write! I write mostly OCs, too. It's a hard genre to break out in, but regular updates, review swaps, and other advertising can get you readers, if you care about that :)
