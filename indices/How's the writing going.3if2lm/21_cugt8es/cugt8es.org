Working (very slowly) on my first fic. I have a broad outline, some pretty cool hooks, and even an early twist. Problem is, I always get discouraged after reading threads here about what people hate. (seemingly everything)

I'm kind of wary about the whole idea of the story, because it is, to my knowledge, an original start, and I'm using my own characters. Also, I'm American, so my britpicks would be awful if I attempted them, so that's kind of rough one.

P.S. I've been up for about 40 hours, so please don't judge my writing capabilities on this terribly written post. <3

Edit: If anyone is interested in letting me run my ideas by them, lemme know!
