Not especially well.

I currently have 3.5 stories in process.

Shadow of Angmar is my main focus and the next chapter is now than half done. However my computer finally popped its clogs last week and so everything's on hold. Also I'm battling with creating an entirely new culture, architecture and language for the new people that Harry will be encountering. It's slowed things down a lot.

A New Man only has 1000 or so words written towards the next chapter. It was easy to write (much easier than Angmar) but it is also the story that readers are most dubious of due to the setup.

Harry Potter and the Sun Queen has about half a chapter waiting. It's mostly action and not too difficult to do. But it's also my least popular fic. It was also the first thing I wrote, so the story isn't really planned in any meaningful way.

Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous is the 0.5. Chapters for this mostly happen very quickly in a single sitting after a moment of inspiration. No moments recently, sadly.

On top of my computer dying I'm also still trying to find the best way to fit my writing around the new job. But I'm determined to never abandon anything, even if it might mean weeks between updates.
