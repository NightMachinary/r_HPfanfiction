I'm very much enjoying reading Shadow of Angmar. It's nice reading a middle-earth crossover that's not a rerun of the hobbit+LoTR with Harry smashing the life out of everything. I've not read the silmarillion, as I tried reading children of Hurin which drained my enthusiasm for the series, so everything is fresh and interesting for me in your fic. I'm enjoying him not having a wand just yet and I'm excited for your next chapter.

The elves most fabulous is hilarious and whenever an email comes through about an update everything gets dropped and for the rest of the day I'm in a brighter mood.

The power he knows not was a nice read that was short enough to get through in a sitting, it was an ideal length and was more interesting than any other rerun I've read. The ending was particularly good.

Sorry, I couldn't help but let you know I appreciate your writing.
