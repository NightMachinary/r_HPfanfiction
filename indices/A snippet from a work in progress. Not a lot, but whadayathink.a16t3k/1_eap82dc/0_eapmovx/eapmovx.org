I get what you're saying. This part is pretty deep into the story, around the time Harry is 14. My take on it is that Harry has been abused in different forms since he was taken in by the Dursleys. Not the all out abuse some fics have, more along the canon version. But the way Rowling handled him coming in to the wizarding world doesn't sit right with me. Surely an 11 year old starved on attention and love would be rather hesitant to trust people and have some pretty solid barriers put up around his mind and heart. Just straight up trusting the people he meets in the wizarding world from the get go doesn't seem realistic to me. This is one of the few times he gets away and lets some pressure out of him, not the way he always is. He's not seriously contemplating suicide, it's more along the lines that he's just tired of it all and in a really depressed state of mind in this moment. I realize how it could be taken the way you've taken it, and I'm grateful you took the time to give me your thoughts on it, cheers :)
