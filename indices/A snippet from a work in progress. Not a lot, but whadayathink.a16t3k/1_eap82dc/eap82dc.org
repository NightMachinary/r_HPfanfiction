There is a lot of purple prose, and I feel like I'm reading a fic where Harry wears guyliner and organizes poetry readings in the shrieking shack. Honestly, if you open with this amount of suicidal ideation I want to either see Harry follow through and impale himself with a basilisk fang through the heart or have him committed to st.mungos for his own safety assuming he has anyone in this fic who actually cares. If there's a suicide hotline for young people in the magical world he should drop them an owl.

That being said, there is a market audience for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, so I'm sure you'll get reviews and or kudos for it.
