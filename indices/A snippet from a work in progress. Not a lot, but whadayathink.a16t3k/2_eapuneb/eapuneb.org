I'll try to preserve your wording without injecting too much of my editing.

#+begin_quote
  Harry stood +untop of+ *atop* the astronomy tower and gazed +unto+ *up at* the night sky high above. +His view undiminished by the clarity of the moment.+ He felt +so+ insignificant right there and then. No troubles or worries could measure up to the vastness of the skies above. It was hauntingly beautiful(*,*) and in a moment of realization Harry understood that he truly was nothing compared to the powers at work in the universe.
#+end_quote

Untop isn't a word to my knowledge, unto is an archaic way to say 'to', so I guess "gazed to/unto the sky" is technically valid, but I would change it. Crossed out a sentence that didn't make sense to me as well as an unnecessary word, added a comma to break up a long sentence. (Long sentences can be good sometimes, when you want a scene to feel fast-paced/breathless, but I think it reads better with a pause there.)

#+begin_quote
  Harry was no stranger to the feeling of being nothing, to not matter*ing* to anyone or anything. His heart ached for the love of a family. To feel the embrace of a mother. To +feel+ *see* the proud look in his father(*'*)s eyes.

  The *night sky* became blurry as Harry's thoughts drifted into territory that left his eyes prickling with unshed tears. Slowly he slumped to the floor of the tower *and sat* +on his knees+ with his arms limp +on+ *at* his sides he cried. There was no point in holding back the tears now. No one to show strength for. The people inside the castle *were* long ago asleep, unaware of the troubles of their saviour.

  He couldn't begin to +phatom+ *fathom* how people expected him to be their saviour. Didn't they see that he was broken? Couldn't they tell that all he wanted was someone to see him(*?*)

  Someone to shield him from the terrifying storm that +is+ *was* life.

  Harry was tired of it all. Tired of looking strong *in front* of people that counted on him.

  It was his greatest shame *to* know that he was +week+ *weak*. He wasn't the saviour they all thought +of him+ *he was*. Surely they would all abandon him if they knew the +weekness+ *weakness* of his heart?
#+end_quote

Week = seven days, weak = not strong

#+begin_quote
  He opened his eyes and saw the grounds stretching out *in front* of the tower.

  For taking the easy way out(*?*)

  Harry suddenly rose from the floor of the astronomy tower. He steeled +his look+ *himself* and wiped away the tear tracks on his cheeks.

  It was his moment of +realese+ *release*, fleeting +and short+ as it may be.
#+end_quote

Redundancy and a misspelling

#+begin_quote
  He turned around and left himself behind. He took the spiraling stairs down +from+ the +astronomy+ tower as Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived. Left on top +of the astronomy tower+ was Harry, The Boy Who Loathed Living.
#+end_quote

Once we know what/where something is, there's no need to keep reminding us.

Like I said, minor grammatical nitpicks. I hope some of this helps you.
