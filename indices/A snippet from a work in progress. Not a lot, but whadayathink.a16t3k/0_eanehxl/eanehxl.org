There are some minor grammatical problems/misused words, but overall I think this is great. It's quite dramatic, so much so as to feel OOC for canon Harry in my opinion, but there's stuff like this

#+begin_quote
  Harry was tired of it all. Tired of looking strong infront of people that counted on him. Tired of turning the other cheek. Tired of rising up every time he got knocked down.
#+end_quote

and this

#+begin_quote
  He would get to meet his parents for the first time since he was robbed of them. His parents and the rest of his family. The people that would care for him no matter what. People that would see him and say "it's alright". Or would they be angry with him for giving up? For taking the easy way out? For being a coward?
#+end_quote

Those thoughts felt to me like you nailed Harry's character if he'd had his despair turned up to eleven, very impactful. But finding himself a private place to cry feels a bit overboard, unless there was some inciting incident like Sirius's death that had happened recently.

That said, I enjoyed it. Nice job!
