Sure thing! I'll do a quick markup for you in a few minutes, but I'm no professional---take my thoughts with a grain of salt.

Canon Harry's mental resilience is a defining character trait, so that's why I feel the emotional stuff is a tad too strong, but then again I have no idea how much worse off he is in your story. If you're going for your own version of Harry that is of course perfectly fine as well.
