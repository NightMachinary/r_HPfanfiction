Thanks for the input man! English isn't my native language so it's bound to be some errors, even more so considering this is basically the first draft. Could you point out the ones you thought of, if it isn't too much too ask? :) This part taken out of context does seem very dramatic and a bit overboard as you say, I get that haha.. It's pretty far into the story at this point and I personally feel it's a pretty natural build up to this point, considering he's around 14 at the time and have multiple issues he hasn't dealt with at all from a very young age. Hopefully I'll finish it up and can share it with people soon. Thanks for sharing your thoughts on it, means a lot :)
