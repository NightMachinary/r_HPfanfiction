I like the idea of the plot, though I've seen it done better. Additionally, the writing is mostly in big walls of text. I can't follow that very well. I've seen many Manipulative!Dumbledore stories do it better, in both plot and writing. Perhaps come up with a new reason for /why/ Dumbledore did what he did?

Best of luck with your writing. I haven't read very many Bellatrix/Hermione stories, so I'll have to assimilate myself to the pairing at some point.
