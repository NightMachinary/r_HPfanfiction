Great minds and all, I was literally coming to make a post just like this. I'm partway through linkffn(Three Turns by Elipsa) and it's looking like that's the direction it's headed (at least I hope so)

I hate how in time travel fics, whomever gets sent back to the Marauder's era immediately sets about alienating Peter. Esp. when they go back young. Fourth year Peter hasn't done shit and doesn't deserve your attitude.

I'd really like someone to write a fic where someone goes back in time SPECIFICALLY to prevent Peter from betraying them.
