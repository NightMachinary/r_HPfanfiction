  In the aftermath of war, Hermione retreats to the Hogwarts library to repair her sanctuary and herself. Through broken magic, she's given the opportunity to help fix even more when she stumbles across a friendless first year Gryffindor. --- (Short Fic. Rated T for language. You will not like the pairing. Or you will like it, but then hate yourself and me for making you like it.)
