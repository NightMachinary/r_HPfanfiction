i don't hate shipping per se, and there are several fics i like that are romance-centered, but i've found that overall i prefer stories that either have minimal pairings or pairings that are secondary to other aspects of the plot. i'm mostly aromantic and find that i can't really relate to stories overly focused on romance.
