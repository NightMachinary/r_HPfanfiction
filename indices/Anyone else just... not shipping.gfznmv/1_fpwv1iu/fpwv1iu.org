I don't ship either.

But searching for ships sometimes give you a hint of what kind of fic you'll be reading. Like, Daphne/Harry tends to political, grey area. Ginny/Harry tends to fluff or adventure, Harry/Hermione may be fluff, Weasley bashing or adventure, depending of when it was written, Luna/Harry offers an oniric atmosphere sometimes, etc. So I sometimes search fic using ships if I want to read certain types of fics.

I think of pairings more as a tool for searching than an actual preference, if I can say so. But then, it doesn't work all the time, thankfully (if we can't get surprise by a way things are written, what the point?).
