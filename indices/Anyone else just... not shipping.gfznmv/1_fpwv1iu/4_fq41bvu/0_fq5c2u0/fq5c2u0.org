Well, from what I've observed, Fleur/Harry can be grounds for Independent!Harry, smut, AU or world building outside of Hogwarts, etc. Usually, Harry is older than 11yo, also. This is just my observation as a fanfiction (binge-) reader, nothing that can really tell "what type of person you are"... there are most likely a bunch of fics which doesn't follow the patterns I've said but it does help me when I search for a certain "flavour" of fics when I'm questing for new ones without recs.
