I don't have specific pairings I like to read. I'll happily read both Harry/Ginny and Harry/Hermione, for example, so long as I like the way the author treats the characters. And I'll happily read fics with no romance at all.

I *do* have specific pairings that I don't like to read, however. Harry is my avatar in the HP world, so I don't like reading him paired with anyone I would not want to be paired with in real life. So no Harry/male, no Harry/Bellatrix, no Harry/Madam Maxime, etc.

Harry's the only one I have super strong feelings about, but I do have some secondary pairings I avoid as well: Sirius/Remus, Snape/Hermione, Draco/Hermione, etc. But these are all more that I dislike the kind of fics they appear in rather than disliking the pairing per se.
