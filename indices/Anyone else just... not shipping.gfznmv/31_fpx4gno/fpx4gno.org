I do like some good Harry/Draco, but mostly because that's such an absurd concept that most of the fun is in reading how and why they get together. I don't mind most other pairings if they happen, but I prefer fics where the main focus is somewhere else. I find it incredibly jarring if I'm reading a good adventure story and suddenly have skip over several pages of repeatedly inserting body part A into body part B.
