Same! I don't really care what the pairing is, but some particular ones set the tone for how the story will progress. For this reason I tend to read Snarry and Tomarry, just because they usually end up with a competent Harry by the end of it and the problems tackled are often less juvenile.

Also I hate how many authors suck at writing female characters, especially as love interests.
