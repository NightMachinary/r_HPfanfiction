Wolfstar is a deal breaker for me in any fic. You could write the holy grail of fanfiction, make it the best piece of writing for the series since "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of Number 4 Privet Drive were perfectly normal, thank you very much", but the *second* you make Sirius and Remus anything other than brothers in all but blood?

It goes into my trash can of discarded fics.
