I think for me it's mostly because the two are obviously very close friends in a way that romantic partners wouldn't be. Romantic partners are romantic partners, bros like them are bros like them. The relationships are different on a fundamental level, and it even feels a bit homophobic to me personally to insinuate that two guys can't be close friends without being gay.

Additionally, while they do have the chemistry of a friendship and "brothers in all but blood"-ship, they don't have any sort of romantic chemistry.
