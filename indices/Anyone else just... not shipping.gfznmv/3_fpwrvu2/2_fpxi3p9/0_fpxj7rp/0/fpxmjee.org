Huh. Interesting! I don't read many Wolfstar fics specifically, but I think it's an adorable ship and I don't mind it at all. I feel like their friendship makes it a super wholesome romance, possibly because in real life I prefer romances that feel like a friendship.

But I totally respect your view and think it's interesting!
