Most romance in HP fanfics is terribly unrealistic. As is most other stuff, but since the premise is magic school I can excuse unrealistic physics, but not unrealistic relationships (unless there's a love potion involved).

Gimme something with a decent plot, some suspenseful action scenes, high speed broom chases, curses flying and spies spying, and I'm happy.
