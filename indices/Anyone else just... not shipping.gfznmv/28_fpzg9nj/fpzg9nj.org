I don't ship but I have ships that I enjoy, because I like how they draw out the best and worst of the other character (or they do in good fics)

E.g: my favourite ships are HarryxLuna and HarryxCho. The former in fics I've read makes Harry a lot more grounded and usually showcases how sharp but caring Luna is. And although the latter can come across as super angsty at times, HarryxCho usually ends up as "mental healing" fics, where the two sort of address their shared trauma and become better people because of it.

I don't have an OTP and I don't actively sit around in fandoms and pair up the characters, but there is a lot to love about shipping when you're just sat in the sidelines enjoying what people make out of it.
