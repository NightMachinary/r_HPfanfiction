How dare some heathens not have an OTP /s

Seriously though, I think the reason shipping is such a big matter in fanfiction (not just HP, but everywhere more or less) is that romance is the kind of thing people get really invested in. People read a lot of different subtexts in a plot romance-wise and thus a fic with the "wrong" ship from their point of view can be rather jarring. Certain ships can make or break a fic for me sometimes, whatever I think of the plot otherwise. But at the same time, when I'm not looking for a fic with my favorite ship in particular, I actually prefer fics to not have a romantic focus at all (This is how I like my SS&HP fics for example; gen).
