I tend to like most of them. Having said that, my favorite stories are generally stories that are set when the kids are still kids, because there's so much potential to reinvent at that stage with the knowledge of how dangerous the world around them actually is (Voldemort is /in the school/ and actively trying to kill Harry, the kids' intelligence and ability is lower, the government is crazy and no-one knows yet, there's good secondary characters and background activity that the kids don't know about etc.)
