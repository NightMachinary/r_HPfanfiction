I don't ship it all. I write so many odd pairings but I just like trying out new dynamics and see how they work together. Its fun. I generally prefer reading gen fics mostly.

I avoid some ships but thats because I don't like how they work together but then I find a story with an intresting idea and I'll read it. So, no NOTPs either.
