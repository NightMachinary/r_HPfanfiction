I don't really ship, I just anti ship.

I dont read harry/hermione because it usually makes hermione a much better version of herself, and doesnt really address any of her flaws.\\
I dont read harry/luna because luna characterization in fanfiction is pretty bad.\\
I dont read draco/hermione because of draco apologism.

stuff like that
