I don't have any preferences either, nor much care about who ends up with who. But it kinda irks me that despite what a huge fandom we have, and despite having a source material quite up for it, HP fanfiction only really has five or six pairings that repeat themselves obsessively in every single fanfic.

Hermione, Ginny, Daphne, and, at a great difference, Fleur, Tonks and Luna. Anything else is a rare accident, and some pairings dont even have any fic about them, at least one that isnt smut.
