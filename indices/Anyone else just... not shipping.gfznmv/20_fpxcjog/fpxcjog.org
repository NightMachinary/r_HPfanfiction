I ship, but most of the time I don't really pursue fics with ships in this particular fandom. Yeah, recently I've been looking for some fics for Remus/Harry (in the Marauder timeline) and some Drarry, but I don't really care all that much. It's mainly because I recently just started reading HP fics in the past week and I wanted to explore the fandom a bit. Most of the pairings are things I don't like, don't agree with (Harry/Hermione, Sirius/Harry, and Draco/Hermione) or I can't actually find a good story with it.

I'm having trouble enough finding the fics I want, I don't need to remove any options with particular ships (Marauder era Remus/Harry).
