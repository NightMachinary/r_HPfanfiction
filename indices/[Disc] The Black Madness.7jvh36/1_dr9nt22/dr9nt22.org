I love writing Walburga. I make her cruel and scathing because she's unhappy with the life she's forced into (getting married to the purest, but not being very desirable or being a proper lady, etc) though she's an extreme blood supremacist. So if she's similar to that in a fic, I love it.

I usually like all fics with that generation of Blacks because it was left up in the air in canon. It's interesting to see others' characterization of them. Unfortunately, I can't find many where they're more than mentioned as Sirius' parents.
