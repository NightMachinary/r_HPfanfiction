I don't view as the Black madness per se. I think of it as the Blacks being highly skilled and knowledgeable in the mind arts. When I say mind arts, I don't only mean being talented legillemancers and occlumancers, but also the imperious curse, illusions, mind altering charms and substances, astral projections, etc. I think this gives the reason for the madness, as it is only in the overly ambitious of the Blacks that it is found - the ones that would delve too deep and go beyond their capabilities.

That's how I like to see it and it features heavily in the fics I'm writing. I like to think that Harry's talent for throwing off the imperious curse comes from his Black heritage.
