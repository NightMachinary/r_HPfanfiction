What's your definition of ritual? I think I've taken an odd approach in that I see ritual as being anything which takes existing magical meanings/concepts from the aether/environment to help craft a spell. So as well as what you'd imagine from a ritual, it would also cover incantations, wand movements and potions. I don't think I'm explaining it very well... >_<
