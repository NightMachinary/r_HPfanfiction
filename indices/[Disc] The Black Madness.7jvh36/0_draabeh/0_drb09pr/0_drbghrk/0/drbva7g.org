That sounds really cool so far :3 most of my fanfiction notes are on magical theory in general (it's AU so I've diverged somewhat from Taure's excellent analysis of magic in canon) but I haven't put much thought into the mind arts yet. I just know that I don't want to go down the defensive mindscape route for occlumency.
