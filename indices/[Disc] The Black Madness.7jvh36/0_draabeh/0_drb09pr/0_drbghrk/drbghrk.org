Mind magic is very closely linked to willpower and soul magic. Rituals can be done to bolster your willpower/proficiency for mind arts, but they come with great risks of losing yourself in the ritual. If you lose yourself then you will follow your whims/emotions steadfastly rather than making a plan and sticking to it.

Those who are proficient in the mind arts are able to manipulate people with their speech and/or mere presence. They use illusions to shape people perceptions as well as playing with people's emotions.

I don't have it all worked out but that's the basis of it.
