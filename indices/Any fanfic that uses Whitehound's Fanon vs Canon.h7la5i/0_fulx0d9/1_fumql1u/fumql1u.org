If they're the same person I have in mind, then the Snape wank can indeed get too straining. For one, I saw them justify that Snape abusing Neville was his own fault because he was good at herbology, so naturally, Snape believes Neville must be good at potions and oh my, it frustrates him to no end, poor Severus. So it is justifiable that he abuses Neville because apparently there's a connection between picking flowers and ladling soup that we weren't supposed to overlook if we /just read between the lines/.

They also have it in mind that Snape is John Nettleship in the flesh. That is, if we are speaking about the same person, but I'm pretty confident that's them.
