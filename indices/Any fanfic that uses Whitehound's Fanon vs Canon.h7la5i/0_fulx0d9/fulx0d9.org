The author bends over backwards to excuse all of Snape's wrongdoings, but no one else is given the same levity. For example, they call Sirius out for taunting Snape during OotP, and while it was childish, they're ignoring the fact that Sirius was trapped in his miserable childhood home with a horcrux. His almost definite mental issues from a 12-year stint in Azkaban couldn't have helped.

They also include bits of fanon in the /same/ essay which is meant to distinguish between canon and fanon - there is no evidence for “the Horcrux-bearing, snake-whispering kid smelling like the next Dark Lord” to a Legilimens. We don't know much about Legilimency at all.

Whitehound makes some valid points, like Dumbledore's sherbet lemons/lemon drops, but the Snape wank is just... too much for me. Sorry if this is a bit harsh.
