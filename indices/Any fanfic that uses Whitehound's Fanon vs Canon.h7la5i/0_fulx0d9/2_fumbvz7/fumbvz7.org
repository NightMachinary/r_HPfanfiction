The article isn't meant to be a collection of sad facts about every character, it's about refuting fanon that contradicts canon. I've never seen anyone say that Sirius being trapped in his childhood home wasn't terrible. The author even points out that the 'prank' that almost led to Severus' death was possibly around the time of Sirius being excommunicated from his family, and thus he was possibly on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
