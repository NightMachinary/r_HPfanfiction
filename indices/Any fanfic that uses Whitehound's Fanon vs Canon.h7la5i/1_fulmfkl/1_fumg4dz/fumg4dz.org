There's also a lot that just ignores obvious counter-arguments in order to assert the author's preferred interpretation as what "must" be the case - e.g. the idea that Galleons cannot be gold because of the difference between how much that amount of gold would cost to buy in the Muggle world versus how much muggle currency galleons are exchanged for at Gringotts.

The obvious answer here is: yeah, and so what? The author never even /tries/ to explain why they have dismissed the possibility that gold has a different value in the wizarding and Muggle worlds. There are so many ways that system could work just fine - for example, if converting wizarding and Muggle currency is an extremely illiquid market and Gringotts only does it for Muggleborns because the Ministry makes them.

But instead, the author just declares without any further consideration that galleons cannot possibly be gold.

This kind of "ignore the various arguments for and against and just assert my opinion" is a running theme throughout the page. The other consistent example of poor reasoning is "Canon is the absolute highest authority - until I decide, on a very selective basis, that I don't like it and therefore it doesn't apply".
