Not the film, but Snape in general. I haven't read the whole thing, but I have skipped around. Here are a few issues I have.

The author argues Snape doesn't like Sirius even after he learns of his innocence because he's rude and a drunk (idk about that); that because Sirius is the brother of Regulus and the cousin of Bellatrix he's untrustworthy. In another part he refers to Snape and the Malfoys as friends. Going as far as to imply Draco calls him Uncle Severus.

The author says Snape cares for Harry more than any other student. However, when Dumbledore asks if he had "grown to care for the boy after all?" Snape says "For /him/?"

Reasons Snape's hatred of Harry isn't irrational.

  ...a lazy, cheeky student who cheats, lies, steals, copies other people's work and deliberately causes a potentially life-threatening explosion in class,

Is Harry lazy and cheeky? Yes. Does Harry do all that at some point? Yeah.

However, this is Snape's assessment, from his own memories, before Harry does anything said there: “--- mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule-breaker, delighted to find himself famous, attention-seeking and impertinent ---”

  and who begins their relationship by communicating with Ron in class just after Snape has finished making his keynote speech,

"Communicating." Harry and Ron share a look and raise their eyebrows.

  and then is arrogant and chippy about his own inability to answer three increasingly easy questions.

The Snape fan bled through here. Yeah, he's cheeky to end it, but I don't get arrogant or chippy at all, though he has every right to be chippy.

  Plus, there are rumours flying around that Harry will be the next Dark Lord and Snape the Legilimens can probably sense the taint of Voldemort which surrounds Harry's scar, without knowing that it's not coming from Harry himself,
#+end_quote

Excuses and conjecture.

  and even before that first disastrous lesson Draco may well have whined to Uncle Severus, his parents' friend, that Famous Harry Potter and his new friend Ron were nasty to him on the train. This will of course make Snape think of the way James and Sirius picked on him on the train on his first day - especially as Ron is the brother of the Twins, who are like a more overtly criminal version of the Marauders, and enjoy picking on Slytherin first years.

Nothing irrational here. And I can't remember if the Twins picked on 1st yr Slytherins or not.
