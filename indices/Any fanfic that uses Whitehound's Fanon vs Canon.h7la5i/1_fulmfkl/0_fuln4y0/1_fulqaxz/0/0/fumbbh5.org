I recommend reading the whole thing. Because just about everything you've mentioned is addressed. Sirius is implied to have a drinking problem in the books (why wouldn't he?). And the use of the name "Uncle Severus" is not meant to mean that Draco literally calls Snape that.

Those examples you've pulled out are listed as possibilities. If I recall correctly, the author goes through just about every possible scenario and interpretation from most sympathetic to least in just about every entry. Even Sirius' 'prank' in the Shrieking Shack is treated with sympathy, given that he was probably on the brink of a nervous breakdown.

And much of the sympathy for Snape is dependant upon acknowledging the behaviour of everyone else around him. If you think Snape is a monster for his behaviour towards his students, for example, you can't let other teachers off the hook for considerably worse behaviour either. The context of the culture matters.

I don't think the author ever argues that Snape cares for Harry himself more than any other student. Snape's greater caring for Harry is acknowledged to be due to his love for Lily, but even then, he cares about his student's safety a great deal.

Probably the only thing I really disagree with the author on is the subject of Dumbledore. Dumbledore is emotionally abusive towards Snape, yes, but it's in the service of securing a vital asset for his side in the war.
