I don't know if the Tom I have in my head is incredibly different, or if people just interpret cannon differently. IMO Voldemort was cunning and smart, but also unstable. You can very clearly see him in the books make choices sole due to anger or frustration.

I've always thought the biggest tool Voldemort had was fear. What goes unsaid is in the bit preceding this scene, Voldemort talks about creating fear and what it does for his war long term. I mean if all he did was kill a few families do you really think people couldn't say his name for the next 15 years? I tend to think he destroyed everything in his path, and in doing so created terror and distrust among the population. Just because he is cunning doesn't mean every action has been planned for days ahead of time. I tend to think he would plan creating terror, and then create it, not particularly caring for planning every action.

That said, I may have distorted my view of Voldemort from cannon by reading a bit too much. I'll have to check up on my cannon Voldemort. Thanks for the advice, I'll be sure to try to add more of his thought process and intelligence.

I do have a question. Where does the idea come from that Voldemort is sophisticated? I've heard it from others before, but it always seemed to me he was a scary bully, who also kills people. He wants thinks to go his way, and if they don't he kills someone even if they are on the same side.
