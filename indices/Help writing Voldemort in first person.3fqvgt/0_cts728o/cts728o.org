I feel like you wrote Bellatrix in that small paragraph. That girl is the epitome of psychotic manslaughter.

Voldemort is quite different. First and foremost I would describe him as a Guerilla General. He doesn't kill for fun, but for his ideals. True he is callous, cold-blooded and values life about as much as a bug on his shoes. But he doesn't kill needlessly. He kills to drive his agenda forward or to solidify his power over his enemies and allies.

Or in other words, he isn't the guy who laughs because he is /in/ an fight, but because he is /winning/ it. He doesn't look for adrenaline, but for triumph. If it is achieved by peaceful means or by violence beyond imagination doesn't really matter.

As I said, your paragraph feels like something that would fit a more nihilistic character like Bellatrix who's prime directive is carnage in the name of her master. But one paragraph isn't much to judge. Depending on context it could fit the Dark Lord just as well.
