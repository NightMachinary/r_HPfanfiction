Whoops! I meant point of view, but I goofed. I will go through and edit word choice later on in the process, but thanks for the heads up. I actually really like the idea of using food to write a character! I'll have to try that out. I'm hesitant to base a character off of one someone else wrote, as it may not encompass that parts I have in my head. Ill give it a read and see if there is a general idea I can extrapolate from. Thanks for the tips!
