First off, do you want to write in first person or just from his pov? On the title you mention 'first person', but your preview is in third person.

Secondly, a small suggestion would be to look out for word repetition. ( Wand- wand, exploded- explosion, taste- taste ) Some people don't mind or even notice that, but it is always good to look out for it.

Finally, I think you have a good grasp on how you should write him. If you want to put yourself in the shoes of a psychopath, just imagine your favorite food and your favorite pastime when you are writing, and replace them with blood and death. Some macabre humour while you are at it would help, if you have the ability for it.

Of course, seeing is learning as well. So, if you want to check out a really well written Dark lord, you should read Brigade's 'Enveloped in the Darkness' and its sequel.
