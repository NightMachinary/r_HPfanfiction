Bard is an all round nice guy.The author could fit in a minor romance with a peaceful parting before LOTR canon begins in earnest. Harry is not an Elf so she can actually be happy even after his death. I do wish that LOTR fics were not all romances. All those (SI/OC)/Legolas fics just make me cringe.
