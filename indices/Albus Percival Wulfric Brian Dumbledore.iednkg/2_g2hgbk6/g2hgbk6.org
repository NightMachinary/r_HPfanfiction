  1. The ending feast in Year 1 is always quoted as proof of "Dumbledore's blatant favoritism". Last I checked it wasn't Draco and Co who stopped quirrelmort. The trio actually did things to earn those points. How about Snape not getting nearly as much stick for actual blatant favoritism

Dumbledore /does/ favour Gryffindor at the expense of Slytherin here. Mind you, this doesn't excuse Snape, who is even worse when it comes to blatant favoritism, but what he did at the end of Year 1 feast was just wrong. Sure, some Slytherins, like Draco, are genuinely wanting to become a Death Eater and oppress all Muggleborns, but I believe a large portion of Slytherin are just normal kids caring about their own business and friends who don't look up to wizarding Hitler. What message does the end of year debacle send them? "Gryffindor is the best house and there's nothing you can do about it".

I don't believe for a second that this is some weird scheme by some master manipulator, I just think what Dumbledore did was very misguided. A better solution to me would have been to give the Trio a trophy for services to the school. Something that doesn't send a message to the entire school that Gryffindors are the best.
