Like every Fanfiction trope Evil Dumbledore can be both good and bad, but I have to agree with you that it is one that tends to be bad. When every inner Monologue of Dumbledore ends with its for the greater good, after all, it gets annoying pretty quickly.\\
My problem with Dumbledores Character lies in JKs Worldbuilding and the paradox she creates with Dumbledores Character. On the one Dumbledore is the greatest Wizard alive defeated of Grindelwald, Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, supreme Mugwump, etc. etc.. Dumbledore is painted as the most influential figure in the British wizarding community. On the other hand, we have a society which is bigoted to its core, the most important Subject in Hogwarts is taught by a boring ghost (yes I consider history to be the most important subject at Hogwarts), the Potions Master is outright abusive of the children in his care and makes eleven-year-olds cry regularly and you all the things that don't make much sense in the Wizarding World.\\
When one would look at how Dumbledores character is depicted in the books and how many of those problems he should be able to solve, and how little he apparently is doing to solve them is what makes his character a paradox because, according to his characterization he should try to solve them.
