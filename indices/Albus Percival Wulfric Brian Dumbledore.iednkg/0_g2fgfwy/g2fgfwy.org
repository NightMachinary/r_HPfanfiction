Dumbledore's first priority was Harry. Dumbledore admits himself that he tried to remain detached from Harry, for Harry's good and everyone else's, but was unable too. Dumbledore loved Harry.

Dumbledore did his best to ensure Harry had as normal as a life as he could while preparing Harry for what Voldemort would do. Harry always had a choice. Harry was the one who chose to go after the stone.

If Dumbledore really was all about the greater good or his own selfish good, he'd have raised Harry as a child soldier, brainwashing him with simple psychology and magic.
