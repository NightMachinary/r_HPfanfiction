Also, everyone conveniently forgets that while Dumbledore did /act/ as though he was raising Harry to be slaughtered, it was just an /act/. He couldn't reveal anything more to Snape than absolutely necessary, because Harry had to /believe/ that he was going to his death.

Harry surviving was Dumbledore's plan all along. In Harry's 4th year, after the events in the graveyard, Dumbledore gets a very out of place, very brief look of /triumph/ on his face, when Harry describes the ritual that was used to resurrect Voldemort. Dumbledore knew immediately that Voldemort taking Harry's blood would tether him to life and allow him to come back after Voldemort destroyed the horcrux Harry carried.

Sure, it was a farfetched plan and Dumbledore could not have /known/ it would work, despite planning and hoping it would. However, the people who complain about that are removing all agency from Harry himself. Dumbledore loved and, more importantly, /knew/ Harry's personality. He knew Harry would never accept abandoning his home to Voldemort. So, knowing Harry would eventually have to face Voldemort one way or another, he put as much planning and contingency into it being setup so Harry could survive as possible.

Dumbledore is manipulative. Dumbledore is extremely clever. Dumbledore knows how to mess with people's emotions to get a desired outcome, and he knew when to keep his cards close to his chest. No one is arguing that. But for all his manipulations, his goal was to save the fucking world and keep one of the few people who he truly loved and cared for alive in the process.
