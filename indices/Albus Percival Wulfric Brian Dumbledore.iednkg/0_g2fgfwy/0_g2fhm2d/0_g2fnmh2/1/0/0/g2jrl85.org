Exactly. Dumbledore counted on voldemorts arrogance. He didn't know exactly that he would use a specific ritual that specifically had Harry's blood in it but he hoped he would. Dumbledore made a lot of really good guesses. He didn't predict the future he just made extremely well educated guess because of how well he knew voldemort.

In all honesty dumbledore was probably hoping harry sacrificing himself would be the last last last back up plan. And was probably researching his ass off with other ways to help him. He first and foremost loved harry like a grandchild and would have done anything in his power to save harry if voldemort didn't use thay specific ritual.
