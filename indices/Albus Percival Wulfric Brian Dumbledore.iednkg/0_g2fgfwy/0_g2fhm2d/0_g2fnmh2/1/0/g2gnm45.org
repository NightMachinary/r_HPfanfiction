I said as much in my OP. Harry survived because Voldemort took his blood in the ritual. I dedicated my entire second paragraph to this.

I feel like there's no possible way you read my message. I addressed this point specifically in the entirety of my third paragraph. No, Dumbledore could not have /known/ his theory would work. However, Dumbledore knew Harry well enough to know Harry was going to face Voldemort, anyways. When the choices are "Face Voldemort and be forced to die because of the Horcrux in your head" or "Face Voldemort and be forced to die because of the Horcrux in your head, but also here's a chance to survive," Dumbledore made sure Harry was armed with the latter option.

  And he damn sure couldn't know Voldemort would mix his blood with Harry's before he did.

Just like Dumbledore couldn't have possibly known Voldemort would use the Philosopher's Stone to recreate his body? Oh, wait...

Obviously, there are only so many ways available to a wraith-like being to be resurrected. It's not exactly a stretch that Dumbledore was aware of the possibility of Voldemort using this ritual. Counted on it, even. Again, read my first paragraph. When Harry describes the ritual to Dumbledore, and how Voldemort used his blood, Dumbledore gets a /triumphant/ look on his face. He was /immediately/ aware of the potential life-saving ramifications of Voldemort's shortsightedness.

Voldemort used Harry's blood, specifically, to bypass Lily's protections. Voldemort could have used anyone's, but Dumbledore planned on Voldemort wanting a way around it.
