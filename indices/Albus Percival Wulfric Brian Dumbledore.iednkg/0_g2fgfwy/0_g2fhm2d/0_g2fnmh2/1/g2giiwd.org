WELL ACTUALLY the only reason because Harry survived was Voldemort mixed his blood to Harry's blood in Goblet of Fire. So, what was the plan before than that? Dumbledore wasn't a prophet omniscient, he didn't know for sure it would work any way. And he damn sure couldn't know Voldemort would mix his blood with Harry's before he did.
