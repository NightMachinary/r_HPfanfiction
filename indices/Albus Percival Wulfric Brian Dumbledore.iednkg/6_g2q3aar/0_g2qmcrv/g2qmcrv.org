This is exactly it. Snape gets a pass because 'aLWaYs' and because Alan Rickman was so perfect in the role it hurt. People call his maniacal obsession with Lily 'love' and use it to excuse his prejudice, savage pettiness, cruelty and just plain meanness. And don't get me started on the Malfoys. Draco was nothing more than a schoolyard bully with zero courage and even less cunning and ambition. But Tom Felton is handsome and the Malfoys are a cute family who switched sides at the last second so they're alright.

I don't even hate the Malfoys or Snape. But people are willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and give em a pass but apparently Dumbledore is Evil von Evilson, Lord of the Greater Good and Manipulation
