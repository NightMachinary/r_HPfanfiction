I love it when people act like Snape is a good guy, Dumbledore is a bad guy, and Dumbledore always gives points to Gryffindor "because Harry", even through he wanted Harry to die. Like, people likes to conveniently forget the entire past of Snape, from his actions as a notorious, Inner Circle Death Eater, to the many times he decided to bully young children to satisfy is ego. But, little did you know, he liked Lily and gave some of his memories to Harry after he died, so I guess he's a good guy ?

Now Dumbledore, ooooh Dumbledore ! This pesky Dumbledore, always giving points to the Golden Trio for risking their lives ! I mean, 50 points for having faced a giant army of magically animated marble pawns in Chess ? How dare he ! Fortunately McGonagall is there to save the day, by withdrawing 20 points to Slytherin but 50 for Gryffindor for the same reasons, these reasons being "being caught outside after curfew for the first time".

I mean, almost dying is worth the same than getting caught after curfew, and that's good ! Right ?

This damnable Dumbledore, who DARED trust the Dursleys to treat their own kin as family ! He could have checked regularly, even despite the fact the Dursleys hates all things magical and Lily must have said so multiple times ! I mean, it wouldn't have made things worse, right ?

And how dare he not do anything after Harry was chosen as a Triwizard champion ? It was only a magically binding contract, to a tournament that was stopped ages ago !

For fuck's sake, he killed his sister ! Sorta, kinda. That means he's evil, even tho he regretted it - alegedly !

And look, the shady dude that's also his brother told the golden trio that Dumbledore liked to control things ! That means he's true evil, right ?

All in all, yeah Dumbledore made mistakes, but I really hate how he's treated as a monster yet people that bash him seems to like Snape and Draco, who are quite worse.
