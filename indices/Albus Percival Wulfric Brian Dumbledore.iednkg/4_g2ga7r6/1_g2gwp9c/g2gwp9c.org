This is exactly it. JKR created a mistake in Dumbledore having all that power in his numerous official positions, authority in decisions over Harry's life as well as power over Hogwarts and in his influence over the general Wizarding world. HP is a children's series before all else. The children had to be the ones having all the adventures and saving the world. But Dumbledore having so much power and not doing anything was an error.

Someone posted recently here that Dumbledore would have been easier to sell across if he had been portrayed as feeling every one of his 100 odd years. If he had been weaker after Grindelwald and the 1st war against Voldemort. If his positions as Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump had been entirely ceremonial. The spritely, sharp as a whip Dumbledore in canon couldn't get away with the bare minimum. I understand that. But the bashing has become too rabid and excessive
