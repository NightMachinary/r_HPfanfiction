I think the reason is there are so many holes in the original stories that its easy to take whatever path you want. Some of these questions take a little more creativity, but there are still questions there that can be open to interpretation and filling in details without changing canon up to a divergence point. We also just saw the highlights of each year, so alot of details about how much teaching/learning would have been at Hogwarts just aren't available.

Were the dursleys behavior abusive? Did Dumbledore endorse the abuse? Did he know Sirius was innocent? Did he have a trial? How much power did he have as Chief warlock to get a new/first trial? How complacent/controlling/corrupt was the ministry? Did Dumbledore have the power to change? How controlling was he about Harry's home life? What would he have done if Harry had resisted? Was Dumbledore testing nature vs nurture theory? Harry and Tom had VERY similar living situations. How much training was Harry given? In the ultimate fight especially in the movies Harry holds on for himself well. How much leeway was in the TWT contracts? Was there a way for Harry to have been released from TWT? How poorly did Snape/Binns/Trewlandy really teach? Is the teaching at Hogwarts stagnating? How comprehensive is a Hogwarts education?\\
Could a 15yo really stand up to an adult wizard (5th year ministry battle)? How aware was Dumbledore of the infiltration of the school (quirell/moody)? Was the Sorcerer's Stone real? How safe was the stone in the final room/mirror? Were there other safeguards in the final room? If the kids had listened to McGonagall about the stone being safe would Tom have been restored? Could the stone have been stuck under Fidelis? Could the Fidelis have been more widely/effectively used? How effective was the order truly?\\
How many people were truly sacrificed knowingly? Why allow the petrified students to remain petrified so long? Did/how much did he know about the basilisk/cos? Were blood quills illegal? How involved were goblins in Inheritance/Wills/Vaults? Was there a Potter Will? What were the Details?

These are just what I can think of right now. Im sure there are plenty of others. But how you answer these questions determines how manipulative/evil/complacent Dumbledore is on things.

Most people forget that the intended audience for the Books were readers that were the same age as Harry. (11yo for HPSS.... 17yo for HPDH) Not full adults who would really come up with these types of questions.

Like all things in life, fanfiction follows cycles. For whatever reason the conrolling/manip/evil dumbles is the trend. Although the time of the truly good, prolific HP FF is past. There are still good stories being written, but they are harder to find, and get updated on less frequent schedules.
