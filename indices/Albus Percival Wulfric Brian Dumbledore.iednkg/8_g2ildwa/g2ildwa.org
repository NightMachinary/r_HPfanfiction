  The ending feast in Year 1 is always quoted as proof of "Dumbledore's blatant favoritism". Last I checked it wasn't Draco and Co who stopped quirrelmort. The trio actually did things to earn those points

Except there were 3 days between the Leaving Feast and Harry & Co stopping Quirrelmort. Dumbledore waited the very last moment, after the banners had been changed to green and silver and the Slytherins thought they had won, to give the points.

Why couldn't he give the points during the 3 days between the Feast and the trio stopping Quirrelmort?

Thsi was a deliberate humiliation of the Slytherins.
