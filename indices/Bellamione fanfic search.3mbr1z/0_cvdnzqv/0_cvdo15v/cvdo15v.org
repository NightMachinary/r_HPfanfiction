  Hermione has become bored with her life and needs a challenge. Bellatrix Just wants to be free again. Are either willing to pay the price for what they want, are they willing to do what needs to be done? Warning: Ron is not very nice in this one. Everyone you know and love will probably be ooc most of the time.
