Yes. Real spoiler ahead: It's not revealed until much later, but due to male infertility, Lily obtains sperm from Severus (with his knowledge) and uses it to impregnate herself and Petunia (neither Severus or Petunia are aware of that part) while Petunia is in the hospital after a string of miscarriages. It makes more sense in story, and is probably the most plausible way to get Snape as the father of both Dudley and Harry.
