According to the wiki, Newt somehow kept an obscurial in stasis, so that might be evidence of a stasis spell of some sort. But I haven't seen the movie, so I can't say for sure.

[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Food-related_charms][Food-related charms]] are a branch of magic that exists, but we don't know many details. It's very possible that some sort of food preservation spell exists, though it may or may not be considered a stasis spell.

The Potions classroom is noted to contain pickled animals and to be quite cold. These are both common pre-refrigerator methods of food preservation, which may indicate that stasis spells or other methods of preservation are not available. Of course, it's possible that a preservation spell on an ingredient could ruin the potion, or that potions could require pickled ingredients specifically. And the temperature could just be a side effect of being in the dungeons, a way to keep the room comfortable when filled with two dozen building cauldrons, or just Snape being a jerk.

If stasis spells existed for medical use, there are a few times when we probably could have seen them used. Harry almost killing Malfoy and Ron being poisoned come to my mind. But it's possible that a stasis spell does exist but no one there knew it.

So basically, there's not much real evidence for stasis spells in canon, but they're one of those things that "probably should" exist in some form.
