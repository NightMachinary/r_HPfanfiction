I also discovered it recently and very much enjoyed it; it's nice that it's a currently updating fic with a decent chance of actually being finished, though I expect it'll be a long time before that's the case.

Without giving any spoilers, I will say that as the story goes on, the author is doing an excellent job of fleshing out the HP universe, including cultures outside of Magical Britain and those have been some of my favorite parts so far. I've been impressed with how the author manages to explain away some of the deficiencies in the original story line by creating new, believable forms of magic.

I've seen some discussion on the subreddit about whether the story actually provides believable reasons for using those tropes. People appear to have strong opinions on both sides about that, so you might see some people disagreeing with your claim (though personally, I agree with you) :)
