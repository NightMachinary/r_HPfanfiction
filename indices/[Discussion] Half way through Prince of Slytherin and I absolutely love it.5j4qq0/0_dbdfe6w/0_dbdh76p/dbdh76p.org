  I will say that as the story goes on, the author is doing an excellent job of fleshing out the HP universe, including cultures outside of Magical Britain and those have been some of my favorite parts so far. I've been impressed with how the author manages to explain away some of the deficiencies in the original story line by creating new, believable forms of magic.

You've hit one of the two big reasons why I love the fic.

The world building is ridiculous. There are constant references to the wizarding world outside of Europe, as well as different types of magic (that all realistically fit into what we know about the nature of magic). Meanwhile, the culture of Wizarding Britain is also expounded upon.

I also like how in-depth the author goes into the magic system (different types of spells, the origin of magic itself, non-spell-based cultures, magical "talents" (occulmency, legimency, parsletongue, etc.), divination and prophecies).
