You know i got turned off by the bad!tropes he was playing way too straight at the start, although i appreciated certain scenes like acting all badass against Snape in the first lesson got called out. Still it is hard to imagine 11-year-old Harry Potter acting all Logical, Rational and a little Aloof. Sorry, but HPMOR soured me on that premise and it really asked me to suspend my disbelief a lot to enjoy that story

Still i did take a peak and just skimmed through the chapters here and there and what little i caught of competent! Lockhart I approve. Still, it is increadibly long and wordy at 500k words and it has just barely started on the third year. For reference, the main series is about a million words total and the first 2 books are about 160k combined, so really, i think the author has too much to say
