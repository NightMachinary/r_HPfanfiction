If the parents stay a while longer, his personality is inevitably going to be affected. Nurture is a huge part of someone's personality.

Beyond that: give him another mother and the blood wards is going to be affected. Give him another father and his vision will likely not be poor. Changing biological parents in general needs to remain consistent with the Prophecy (they defy the Dark Lord thrice).

The most common parent switcheroo is James->Severus (Severitus), but fics generally only have him defy Voldemort once (turning spy against him). The 2nd most common is James->Sirius, which is far more explainable Prophecy-wise (Sirius is an Order member and probably defied Voldemort plenty of times). Neither of them wear glasses, so Harry's need of them is left unexplained.
