Non-crossover:

Harry Potter is the son of James Potter and Lily Potter (Evans), if author(s) remove even one of the parent he becomes nothing more than an OC.

Crossover:

If he is reborn he should have his memories at the least otherwise OC to me.

Environment, who raise him, how they raise him (if they raise him with love and care he accept their world view more likely) and similar things are the most important (%98) that effects personality.
