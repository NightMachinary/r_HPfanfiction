Eh... No. You think Genetics are the only things that are passed off? Especially in regards to Naruto. Remove Kushina as his mother and you remove all the cool Uzumaki concepts. Remove Minato as his father and you basically remove the one thing that redeems Hiruzen's withhold of information.

Also, Jiraya no matter how noble you might think he is. Wouldn't be as interested in Naruto if he wasn't Minato's son. Basically every important character that was from Konoha knew his heritage except for he himself and those of the younger generations.

Now for Harry Potter this isn't as catastrophically easy to simplify so I won't try. But I'm sure somebody could manage to deconstruct rather properly how his heritage from his parents shaped him. Could you write a "Harry" without that heritage, sure. But it would be a "Harry in name only" fic.
