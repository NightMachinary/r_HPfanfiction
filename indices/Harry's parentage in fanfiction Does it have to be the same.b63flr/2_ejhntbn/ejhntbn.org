A tricky question. Some people subscribe to the idea that the MC has to at least start as the person they were in canon to be considered the same character. I agree in that regard, but I don't think it matters much.

For stories like Harry Potter or Naruto, it doesn't really matter in regard to their parentage. The two never really had contact with their family. Who you are depends on your genetics and your circumstances. I may raise an eyebrow at an identical Harry being born from a different couple, but I wouldn't put the story down unless he wasn't still an orphan. A person who was raised in an abusive home simply can't act identical to someone who was raised in a functional home. That contradiction would be a sign of bad writing to me.

Go ahead and consider if you want to have Harry or a character wearing Harry's face. Both are valid, but it will be a good idea to cement it to start with. The younger you change the involving Harry the greater the effect will be as character is more susceptible to circumstances when you are younger. Harry living with another family at three with be significantly different than Harry living with another family at ten.
