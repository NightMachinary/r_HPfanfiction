  James is sitting on the couch, Harry next to him, giggling and smiling and Lily's standing near the kitchen counter, James has his wand out, it shoots colorful bubbles and Harry loves them, he's clapping excitedly -The silver Patronus materialises in front of James so suddenly, that he can't even react."Peter's a death eater," Sirius's voice says. "He's sold you out. Voldemort's coming for you. Tonight. Run, Prongs."AlternativelySirius gets expelled after the Prank in Fifth Year, and everything changes.
