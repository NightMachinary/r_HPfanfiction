linkao3(Victoria Potter by Taure)

Just very well written overall, with the best AU magic system I've ever read. Also an amazing characterization of Dumbledore.

linkao3(a dealer, not a Death Eater by Jaxon) A very unique take on the snily relationship, in that Snape doesn't become a DE, but is instead an illegal potions dealer for Lucius Malfoy (who he doesn't know is a DE) in a relationship with Lily. You find out how that came to be later on. I love it because it's a rare take on a Snape who isn't bitter and self loathing, he's happy in fact, but he still has a whole lot of issues and trauma, and does some fucked up shit. It's a realistic portrayal of who Snape could have been. Very plotty and unpredictable, though the style is so unlike HP it's hard to get into at first. It also has one of the best marauder characterizations I've seen. While I've seen better characterization of the marauders individually in other stories, none have gotten their dynamic as perfect as in this story. The only real flaw is that Wormtail is sanitized imo, but oh well. Still miles better than average.
