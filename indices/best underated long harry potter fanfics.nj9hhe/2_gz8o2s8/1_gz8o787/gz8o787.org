#+begin_quote
  A month after the Battle of Hogwarts, war-scarred, pre-Auror recruit Harry has a new target: Antonin Dolohov, the man who killed Remus Lupin. When a tip from Malfoy leads Harry, Ron, and Hermione into an ambush, however, Harry's Master of Death power awakens and sends him--- and Malfoy--- to the time of Dolohov's first murder in 1978. As Harry and Draco struggle to find their way home while (re)doing their seventh year at Hogwarts, Voldemort is at the height of his power in the First Wizarding War. And, despite not being born yet, he's still targeting Harry. Harry and Draco fight for their lives and their future, burdened with the knowledge of what will happen to everyone around them. The Marauders, on the other hand, are more concerned with pranks, love, and N.E.W.T.s than the war outside the castle.

  She had a life once, but she doesn't remember. All she knows is the ashes and blood she tastes as she wakes up yet again... She's got one more try to get it right. - Haesel hadn't quite thought of this when she'd accepted Death's 'chance to live with those she'd lost'. AU, time travel, fem!Harry, T for now?

  Lily has revolved around him for years, ever since he held out his hand and made impossible things happen; cracked open her tiny little world and showed her magic.And for the longest time she loves him. And then he rips her apart.â€œMudblood," he says, and it's like poison right in the heart of her. She starts coughing.~Basically I got fed up of people online blaming Lily for not loving Snape so I decided fuck it she's getting a fic where she's strong and brave and needs no man, especially not one that treats her like shit thank-you-not-very-much.Yes I'm salty.
