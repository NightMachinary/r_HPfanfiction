The key is what qualifies as "underrated." I don't suspect I can contribute much as I tend to find stuff by sorting by Kudos / Favorites / Follows and then either specifying Complete status or a Published / Updated in the last 1-3 months etc.

The best long fic IMO is Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches. I avoided it for years because of WBWL but it's just wonderful in every regard.
