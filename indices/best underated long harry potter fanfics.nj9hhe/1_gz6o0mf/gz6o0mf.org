I've been following code name: crimson Hare for a while and it's amazing. Harry has a different upbringing and is a gentleman thief. Hermione is a french investigator having gone to beaubatons after the troll incident. It's gone completely bonkers since Voldemort arrived on the scene, at the moment they're in the Egyptian underworld. Holy cow, the amount of worldbuilding and travel they're doing is one of the things that inspired me to write my latest fic. Ongoing but updates relatively frequently, totally underrated imho. Give it a read and review if you enjoy it, I feel like they really deserve more. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13189098/1/][FFN]] linkffn(13189098)
