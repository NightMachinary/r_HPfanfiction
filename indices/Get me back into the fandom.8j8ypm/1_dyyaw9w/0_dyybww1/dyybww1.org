Hmmm. how heavily does romance feature as a focus of the latter? I'm not averse to romance in a story, but I have literally no interest in the concept for its own sake- if the story exists primarily and first among all things as a romance, I doubt I'll get into it. Not saying I won't start, but... eh.

The concept of The Mind Arts has me hooked, though. Gonna give that one a shot as soon as I either finish or drop Reclamation.
