Except that their mistakes were simple ones of getting the movement wrong or mispronouncing the incantation. There was /no/ mention of literally any element beyond that at any point.

As for her ability to learn spells from books, again, we have no indication of what that entails. It's possible- even likely- that it's just indication of a near obsessive use of trial and error- the reason it would be difficult to learn from a book would be that they cant clearly show the movements and pronunciation, so it /would/ take a great deal of effort to figure out how to cast, but it would just be trying every interpretation of the instructions until you get it right. That's not something that requires a great deal of intelligence, but it's /definitely/ something I can imagine Hermione doing.

Like I said, i don't really think either of us is gonna convince the other. To my mind, there are very few instances which I can recall that Hermione demonstrated what I consider to be intelligence- the only ones that come to mind are the Protean charm idea, and figuring out the basilisk. Her early mastery of spells is certainly noteworthy, but we lack any clear information on what exactly that entails to be able to draw a conclusion from.
