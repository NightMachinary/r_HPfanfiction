She literally solved a logic puzzle which (stupid though the idea is) would have stumped most wizards. That's about as close to a logical deduction as you're likely to get. Similarly, again, I'd argue the Protean Charm used to send secret coded messages in an innocuous way counts as solving a problem in an unconventional way. I don't think there were really any times where she just threw a book at it, most of the time she had just already read the books that had the information (yes she reads lots of books but they're ones she thinks will be relevant, as opposed to going for any old book). And again, you can't really regurgitate what you read to get a spell going well, you have to understand it (that;s why she kept telling Harry that learning the theory ought to help him overcome his block with Summoning charms).

It's no coincidence that all the most powerful wizards (and the most intelligent ones) are also the most widely read ones.
