And yet book 1 also seems to demonstrate that magic is /nothing/ other than waving your wand and saying some silly words. When Flitwick is teaching the levitation charm, there's no discussion of anything other than wand movements and pronunciation.

Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Intelligence requires the ability to use logic and reason to come to conclusions and solve problems. If it primarily happens offscreen, or we're primarily told about it via other characters or superficial accomplishments (such as having high grades), then it is, by definition, an informed attribute. We're /told/ she's the intelligent one, but we are not /shown/ it.
