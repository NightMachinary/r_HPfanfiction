An important aspect of intelligence is, to me, the ability to use available information and logical deduction to solve problems, often in unexpected or unconventional ways. When you give somebody an IQ test (which yes, I know is not a perfect measure of intelligence), you don't measure academic achievements, you give them a series of different kinds of puzzles and see how well they solve them. Hermione did not demonstrate this kind of intelligence. Her method of problem solving is, as I said, to throw as many books at a problem as possible and hope that one of them has something relevant. Throughout the books, Hermione demonstrated little in the way of problem solving or logical thinking- most of the ways she showed "intelligence" involved regurgitating something she'd memorized, be it a spell she's learned, the ability to follow instructions to brew a potion, or remembering random information from one of the many books she'd read. Her best showing was, to me, figuring out that the monster in book 2 was a Basilisk, and that it travelled via the pipes in the school- /that/ was an impressive conclusion to come to, given that (IIRC) basilisks in the setting are supposed to just kill, not petrify.
