And yet all the other students besides Hermione (who had read the theory of the spell in the textbook) failed to do it, so Harry's observation about magic is correct.

I don't know what this is supposed to mean here. Whenever there is a problem, and Hermione is present on-page to help solve it, she does do so using reason, not just regurgitation. Since she's not the MC there's not really much you can do, this applies to any series but it would be seen as silly to say "Oh those are just informed attributes" since that seems to suggest it's not really the case that they're smart.
