Eeeeehhhhhh. I never really agreed with the perception of Hermione as /inteligent,/ much less /cunning./ She's good at regurgitating information and little else. She's not even very good at /researching/ that information- her approach seems to just be to throw as many books at a problem as she can and hope one of them has relevant information.
