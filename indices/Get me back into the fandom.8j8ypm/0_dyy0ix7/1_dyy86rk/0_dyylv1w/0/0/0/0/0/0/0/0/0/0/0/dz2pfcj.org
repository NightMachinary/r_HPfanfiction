There's no indication that learning magic from a book is /hard,/ either. We have almost no information on it.

I've already addressed the book 1 example and polyjuice. Plus, even if we accept those- that's three instances of genuine intelligence over all seven books. The fact that there arent more relevant examples is my /point./ There are very few occasions across the books where she demonstrated a high level of intelligence- beyond that, it was an attribute we were informed of, not shown.

Anyway, I think we've gone on about this long enough. It doesn't look like either of us is going to convince the other, so agree to disagree?
