There is no indication that learning magic from a book is easy. In fact, given magic is a thing you have to do it's not something that can transition like that, otherwise every student that bothered to read would be equally good but that's impossible to believe from canon, there are too many examples against it (Harry's issues with the Summoning charm is again a good example, he read the theory a bunch).

It's not just the Protean chatm, I already mentioned the book 1 examples and Polyjuice. Potions isn't just following instructions, you have to use spells in class for it to work (JKR said that's why Muggles can't make potions). And if spells don't count at all, then the only recourse is academic achievement. Otherwise whatever you mean by intelligence is too opaque since no relevant example will suffice.
