It was very much an informed attribute, though. Yeah, she was top of her class, and a bunch of people talked about how smart she was. But she only rarely /displayed/ that intelligence. The protean charm is arguably one example. As for the paper she jinxed, that always struck me as rather pointless. Sure, they knew who revealed the group, but it was just revenge. If she'd been /clever,/ she might have warned them after they'd signed it. And again, it's not something that was displayed /often,/ regardless of whether or not that incident can be said to count.
