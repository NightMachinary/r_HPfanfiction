Are you talking about that riddle in the first book? Cause that riddle was easy as shit. And I've already conceded that the Protean charm counts. As for spells, we really have no idea how easy it is to learn them from a book. Harry's not exactly a model student, and we have very little information on what actually goes on in the casting process. What little information we do have seems to indicate that you /could/ learn them from a book fairly easily- it seems to be primarily a matter of making the right movements and sounds, and with magic, the movements can be shown with animated drawings. More to the point, learning spells still isn't problem solving or critical thinking.
