If learning magic by books alone were easy or even mid-difficult, most wouldn't find it hard, but the series seems to make it abundantly clear in classes that magic is rather hard, because you have to do it, not repeat it. Book 1 explicitly says this (paraphrase): "Harry learned there was a lot more to.magic than saying silly words and waving your wand" (which is what you'll primarily get from a book). If simply reading it was enough, Madame Pince would be stronger than Dumbledore.

There are other examples, those are just the obvious ones since they were some of her main contributions. This doesn't make sense to me. You're essentially suggesting that because Hermione isn't running around doing logical derivations when she's onscreen she isn't "really" intelligent. Her being cunning or not is debatable. But being the top of your class is pretty much unimpeachable in this regard. Being an "informed attribute" (which I don't think is true) seems besides the point, she's chiefly portrayed as the intelligent one.
