I'm not sure what you mean by her not displaying it. The early spell mastery shown as soon as book 1, no? (pretty much in every class commented on (charms, transfiguration, potions), save for the flying lessons) Book 2 she brewed a NEWT-level potion (polyjuice), 4th year selected and helped Harry master all the spells needed to get through the tournament (especially for the 3rd task). I'm not saying she didn't have any idiot ball moments (I'd say even Dumbledore had such times). Anyway, I thought they did warn people afterwards? They just didn't say why not to do so, heh.
