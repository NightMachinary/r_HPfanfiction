I just wanted to say, thank you and fuck you for introducing me to this story. It's fantastic- exactly the kind of thing I like. Well written, a solid plot that makes sense, characters that act like /people,/ interesting and fun politics, worldbuilding, and a powerful, interesting protagonist. I spent last night binge-reading the damned thing and gave myself a migraine that could kill a yak.

Edit: I do have a /few/ reservations, obviously. Putting Hermione in Slytherin is just... What the hells? How does that even make sense?
