Actually, Patron's basic world building idea is "The Wizarding World isn't stuck in the Victorian era". I wanted to create a Wizarding Britain that is in some areas far more progressive than muggle Britain, in others more archaic, but in all areas more magical. For example, the average wizards considers the muggles prudes - and the British muggles, at that. They have far different customs than in canon, with magic playing a far bigger role. For example, while the school robes look conservative, the robes of the average wizard or witch can be anything, from robes and dresses to clothing made of illusionary fire - and the more spells on it, the better it serves as a status symbol.
