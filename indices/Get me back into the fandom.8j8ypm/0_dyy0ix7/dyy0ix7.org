[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12058516/1/The-Reclamation-of-Black-Magic][Reclamation of Black Magic]] linkffn(12058516) The build-up for this one was fun and some of the initial pay-off was nice. Some issues to work out since it's ongoing (Harry isn't fun to read yet), but the characterization for the witch coven (especially Cassie) is really good, which is a relief since they are the main characters up until recent chapters, where Harry and Hermione have more pagetime.

In fact... at least according to my FFN app I still need to finish several chapters. Oops.
