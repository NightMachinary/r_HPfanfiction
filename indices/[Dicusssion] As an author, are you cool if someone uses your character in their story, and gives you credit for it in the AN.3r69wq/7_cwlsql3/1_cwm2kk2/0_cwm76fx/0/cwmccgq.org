I'm pointing out that that "respect" is a choice, not a rule. You won't get in trouble for doing it, even if people might think you're a jerk.

It's hard to tell if OP is concerned with respect or legality, so I think it's only proper to clarify the difference. It's still perfectly legal to write ASOIAF fanfiction, just not respectful of the original author. Same with using an OC from a fic, with or without permission.

I absolutely agree with the way you decide to respect them, I just feel it's necessary to point out that acting so considerately is our choice.
