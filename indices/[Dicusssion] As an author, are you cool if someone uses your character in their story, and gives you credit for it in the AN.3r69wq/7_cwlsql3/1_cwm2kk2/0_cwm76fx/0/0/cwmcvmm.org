Yes of course. This is just my opinion, I can't control anyone else. I'm basing this on if I had an OC that someone wanted to use, having them ask me for permission is what I would like for them to do.

As for rules... we all know that its tough time getting the admins/mods over at FFnet to take down pure plagiarism already. They won't bother with grey area like OCs. I'm aware that it's someone's choice to show respect, and I'm merely just asking them to be courteous and tell the author. If they don't, what can I do? Nothing. But I also believe in doing my part to make this world a slightly less assholish place, and since OP asked for opinions, why not give mine.
