No? JK Rowling explicitly said that fanfiction using her characters was alright. OCs can be personal -- some fanfiction authors end up writing original fiction and can end up using those OCs. It's a respect thing. If you respect the author you're borrowing an OC from, you wouldn't repurpose their original character without asking. This is just my opinion however. I don't write fanfiction for ASOIAF because GRRM doesn't approve of it, and I respect that.
