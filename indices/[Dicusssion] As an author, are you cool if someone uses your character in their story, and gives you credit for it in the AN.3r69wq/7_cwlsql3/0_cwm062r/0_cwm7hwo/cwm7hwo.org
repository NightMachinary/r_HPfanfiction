It's about respect. JK explicitly allows us to use her character to make fanfiction -- however that OC you want to use doesn't belong to JK, it belongs to the author that created it. Also, you never know what that author will end up doing with OCs; sometimes fanfic authors will start writing original fiction, maybe even one heavily influenced by their fanfic, and they pull their fanfic from the site, but your story is still up there with the character in there, and they don't even know because you never told them. What's the point of not telling them? If someone used your OC in their own fic, wouldn't you want to know, if not just purely so you can see their take on it?
