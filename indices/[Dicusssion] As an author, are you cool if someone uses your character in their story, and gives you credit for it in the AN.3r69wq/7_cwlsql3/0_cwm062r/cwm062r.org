I wouldn't go so far as to say "don't use it" unless they specifically ask you not to. I'm sure JKR would rather us not write many many things we've written: the point of fanfic is taking existing characters and other bits of canon and juxtaposing them with your ideas. The author doesn't get a say because no one's profiting. You're just making fanfic fanfic. Lol. Now, what you are allowed to do is different from what makes you a jerk to do...
