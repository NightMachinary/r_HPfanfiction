If its an OC character, you should definitely ask the author if you can use it -- and probably tell the author how much of an extent you're going to use that OC. If the author doesn't respond don't use their OC.

However, if its just a take on a canon character (maybe someone did a Hermione with a terminal illness and you liked that) then I don't believe you need permission. Maybe a nod in an AN about inspiration but it's not necessary.
