I'm pretty sure I'd be fine with it, as long as the author gave me a hat tip in acknowledgement. Most of the OCs I've created have played such minor parts that I can't imagine anyone wanting to borrow them. But even if I'd produced a bunch of fully fleshed-out protagonists with complex backstories and novel-length character arcs, I can't imagine objecting to another writer doing to them what I'm already doing to JKR's world and characters. It would be hypocritical of me.
