I mean, isn't that sort of what we are doing in fanfiction anyways? Taking characters from a story and putting them in different situations with (sometimes) different personalities? I think it's cool, as long as someone doesn't use a character in the /exact/ same way, as in same discussions, same actions, same everything. If someone takes a name and uses them completely differently, its just fanfiction.
