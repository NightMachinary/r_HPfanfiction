As a bitter loner.

Or a villain.

Here me out.

In Ravenclaw she'll be no more noticed than any other smart but not exceptional Ravenclaw (Carmichael got 9 Os as well) and if we're keeping in line with her canon characterization, she's not making any friends until Krum 4th year.

So you start out with a lonely 11/12 year old with a vindictive streak watching other smart people make friends. You have this as a romance or friendship redemption story starting in 4th year with Krum. Or you can just make her a worthy villain, which seems pretty easy to do from here.
