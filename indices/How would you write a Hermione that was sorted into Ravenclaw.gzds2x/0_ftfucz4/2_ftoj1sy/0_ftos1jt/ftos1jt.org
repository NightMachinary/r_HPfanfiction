  Ravenclaw is a house of paper-pushers and model train obsessives as much as it is a house of scholars

You can't possibly know which canon characters are Ravenclaws with this description.

I never said Ravenclaws were better students on average. I said she wouldn't stand out amongst those that were.

Learning for attention isn't a problem in Gryffindor. Being top or near top of your class isn't frowned upon. If that were the case James, Lily, Sirius, McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Bill would have had a hard time of it.

What is an anathema is being a bossy know-it-all and hypocritical stickler for rules, which /is/ what 11 yr old Hermione starts out as and that's not suddenly going to change because of a sorting. Rules stop applying to others because of Harry and Ron, who only became her friends because of circumstance. The events of canon aren't going to play out with her in Ravenclaw.

Also, 4th year Cho is the leader of a gaggle of (giggling) girls and one of the most popular Ravenclaws. Her personality couldn't be more different from Hermione's.
