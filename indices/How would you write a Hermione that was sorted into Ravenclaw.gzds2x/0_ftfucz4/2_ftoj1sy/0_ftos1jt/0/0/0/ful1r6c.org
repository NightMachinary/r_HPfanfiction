  Practice is just as important as intelligence, which was my point.

Ah, this was about the brain potion. It's not clear if he used it during the exam or while studying.

  Again, I never said Ravenclaws were better on average and one(1) made a comment to Hermione.
#+end_quote

At the top, Ravenclaws aren't that impressive either, whether it's Slytherins winning the House cup, Gryffindors racking up OWLs and sought-after positions, or a Hufflepuff being picked for the Triwizard.

I am not saying they are necessarily worse than other years, but I just don't think there is any evidence that Hermione wouldn't stand out among them.

#+begin_quote
  Correct, I said that because that's what Hermione does. She doesn't learn for sake of doing it. She does it because it's how she gets attention.
#+end_quote

That's a very uncharitable view of Hermione's motivations, and one I haven't seen before---at least not as her primary motivation. Do you have any actual evidence for it? E.g., when she prioritised showing off knowledge over social justice or curiosity?

  And considering the reaction to Harry, Hermione, and Neville losing 150 pts, Gryffindors obsess over house points, too.
#+end_quote

150 points is a lot of points to lose in one night, and they were refusing to tell anyone why.

  I've already mentioned Krum, but also if she could make more friends why doesn't she? Why are all her friends beyond Krum dependent on circumstance?
#+end_quote

Everybody's friends are dependent on circumstances, starting with Harry and Ron sharing a compartment.

Now, Hermione /thought/ she had befriended Harry and Ron from Hogwarts express and maintained this misconception up until Halloween. As evidence of this, consider that you don't "punish" people who aren't already your friends with silent treatment. It's also why Ron's words got to her so much. After that, she didn't look for any additional ones---but nor did Harry or Ron.

In her third year, she didn't have time to make friends, between the course load and the legal defence of Buckbeak.

  Harry is despised and angry 5th yr and still makes friends in Neville, Luna, and Ginny.
#+end_quote

By the way, all the people she assembled for lobby Harry to teach the DA---she had to have had at least a cordial and trusting relationship with them.

Hermione's no social butterfly, but she isn't as hopeless as you seem to portray her.
