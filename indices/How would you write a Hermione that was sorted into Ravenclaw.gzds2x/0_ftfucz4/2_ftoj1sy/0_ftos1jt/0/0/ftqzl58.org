Practice is just as important as intelligence, which was my point.

Again, I never said Ravenclaws were better on average and one(1) made a comment to Hermione. Terry Boot to be exact.

  I never said that "learning for attention" (whatever that means) or being at the top of the class is frowned upon in Gryffindor. Obsessing over grades and House Points probably is

Correct, I said that because that's what Hermione does. She doesn't learn for sake of doing it. She does it because it's how she gets attention. And considering the reaction to Harry, Hermione, and Neville losing 150 pts, Gryffindors obsess over house points, too.

  I don't buy the surprisingly prevalent idea that Harry and Ron are the only friends Hermione could ever possibly make

I've already mentioned Krum, but also if she could make more friends why doesn't she? Why are all her friends beyond Krum dependent on circumstance?

Ron is able to gravitate to Dean and Seamus in 4th year.

Harry for all his ups and downs in popularity and a-social behavior is able to get along with people beyond just being the boy-who-lived. They get along with their roommates. Harry is despised and angry 5th yr and still makes friends in Neville, Luna, and Ginny.

When Hermione isn't speaking to Harry and Ron she is alone and the only people who try to speak to her are Harry, until she snaps at him, and Hagrid.
