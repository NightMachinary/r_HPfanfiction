In canon, general intelligence (i.e., "book smarts" or capacity for book smarts) is very highly correlated with magical ability. Together with personality, it explains almost all variation we see in magical ability. There are practically no wizards who are unintelligent but powerful or intelligent but weak; and the exceptions tend to have very strong personality factors (e.g., Lockhart, Neville, Harry to some extent).

Percy probably had a time-turner, for logistical reasons if nothing else, but unlike Hermione, he actually used it as intended and didn't spend months researching a completely foreign legal system from books alone. In any case, I think that people underestimate just how impressive a wizard Percy was because of the role he has in canon from Harry's point of view. It's also another data point in favour of the claim that Ravenclaws aren't actually better students than Gryffindors, whether or average or at the top.

The comments from Ravenclaws in OotP are one of the few direct comparisons we get, and it's indicative of what Ravenclaws take pride in and value (which is what Sorting is based on, anyway).

I never said that "learning for attention" (whatever that means) or being at the top of the class is frowned upon in Gryffindor. Obsessing over grades and House Points probably is, however, and I would expect it to be far more accepted in Ravenclaw. Cho was a star athlete, so of course she would be popular; but, if the wiki is to be believed, her friends largely abandoned her after Cedric's death.

And, sure, I agree that Hermione's personality would evolve differently from canon. However, I don't buy the surprisingly prevalent idea that Harry and Ron are the only friends Hermione could ever possibly make.
