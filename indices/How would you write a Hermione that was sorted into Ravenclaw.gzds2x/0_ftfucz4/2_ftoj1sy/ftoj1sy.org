I don't buy it.

Carmichael could have been lying, and if he were telling the truth, he only got them thanks to the potion. Or, he could be the top student in his year---which is the one before Hermione's.

However, we see a lot of direct and indirect evidence that Hermione is easily the best student in her year. We see that magic comes very easily to her---she learns new spells practically at will, before she even starts Hogwarts. Her grades are good enough to get a Time Turner in Year 3 despite being Potioned or Petrified for much of her second year. Every time new magic is introduced in class, she is the first to master it (that Harry sees). Ravenclaws are impressed by her Protean Charm in OotP. Lucius Malfoy is annoyed that Draco's grades were surpassed by Hermione in particular. And, that's without getting into how much time she "wastes" on reading for fun, her annual crusade for justice, or the annual Harry crisis.

Nor do we see any real evidence that Ravenclaws are that much better as students on average. They pride themselves on their wit, but inventors tend to come from Gryffindor and Slytherin. Ravenclaw is a house of paper-pushers and model train obsessives as much as it is a house of scholars.

But, the biggest problem with this premise is that while early Hermione's attitude was anathema to the prevailing Gryffindor culture, it would fit well into the very Ravenclaw culture that bullied Luna, for better or for worse.

So, much as I like a good DangerousLoner!Hermione or WorthyVillain!Hermione, I think she'd actually be pretty happy in Ravenclaw, and she might even emerge as the leader of a gaggle of Ravenclaw girls in her year. I just hope that she has enough of that Gryffindor righteousness left to keep from joining in Luna's bullying.
