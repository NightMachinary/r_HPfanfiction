Happier, with more friends, but also more status-conscious and less eager to rock the boat.

The very early-canon traits that made her a pariah in Gryffindor would make her popular in Ravenclaw.

A lot of people try to shoehorn a Ravenclaw!Hermione into Luna's role, but they are very different people---very much opposites, in fact. Luna is flighty and imaginative. Early-canon Hermione is grounded and knowledgeable. Luna gets bullied because she is weird. Hermione would be admired and envied because she always knows the correct answer and can cite chapter and verse to prove it.

I can see a hypothetical scenario in which some "[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch][Alpha Bitch]]" type who envies her intelligence manages to organise the rest of her year against her, but that's an unstable state of affairs, open to being disrupted by the carrot of Hermione as a study partner and the stick of Hermione being vindictive and good at it. Given Hermione's Ravenclaw "virtues" and force of personality, she's more likely to end up in the role herself.

And so, my headcanon is that Hermione would spend her first few weeks at Hogwarts being Hermione, then be surprised when her roommate asks her advice on some trivial fashion or grooming decision, even though Hermione has never displayed any knowledge of it. It turns out that it's the Ravenclaw way of showing deference and admiration.

But, at the same time, while she will probably retain enough righteousness to refrain from bullying Luna---though she probably won't take steps to protect her from being shunned---she would probably be a bit more reluctant to rock the boat around the House-Elves, unless she manages to convince her friends to join her crusade in earnest.
