linkffn(12867536;12899208;12931474;12973389;13013274;13058572). Dark Spiral Saga has a Harry that hates muggles, in Slytherin and friends with purebloods, and definitely not friendly with Hermione and crew. Harry has Daphne as his Bellatrix(They didn't get together before book 4 though).

Also, linkffn(13165325) as a sequel of sorts to the Dark Spiral Saga linked above, which shows the world after Voldie and Harry won. Can't say much else without spoiling anything.
