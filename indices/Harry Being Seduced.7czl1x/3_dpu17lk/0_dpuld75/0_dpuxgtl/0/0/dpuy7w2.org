Okay. Thank you. I will do that instead if it will not seem rude to people! And yes I did /think that/ the points didn't matter at first because I do not care about popularity, but then I was in this post and I saw that they made my comment invisible so they /do actually/ matter? It is not just to show how much people like you or not here? They make posts go away!
