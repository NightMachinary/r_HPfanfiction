Oh, the points don't really matter. There's nothing to be especially "sorry" about. People on reddit, even on relatively "friendly" forums like this one, are just very quickly angered by what they think is trolling. As I said, if in the future a request doesn't seem interesting to you, ignore it instead of posting a message that says "I don't think this is good". It's sad we have to do this, but it's best for everyone.
