You may be distressed at having been downvoted so much, so let me just drop you a piece of advice --- when you don't like the subject of a prompt, just don't answer. Knowing you, you probably didn't mean any harm, but your phrasing probably felt like a deliberate insult to many people who'd like such a story, and felt you were calling them idiots for liking it.
