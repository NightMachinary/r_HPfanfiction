Thank you for the kind words! We're still working on improving the site and getting every functionality back online but we're making steady progress :).

We're super passionate about NEVER monetizing via ads on the site, we don't believe this gives people the best possible user experience, which is critically important to making fanfiction accessible to new people. Don't worry, we can keep the site online for the forseeable future :) We're committed to keeping these stories online! Its why we got involved in the first place! - Ronnie
