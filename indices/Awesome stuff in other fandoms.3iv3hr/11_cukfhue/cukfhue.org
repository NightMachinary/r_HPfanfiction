linkffn(6555315) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6555315/1/Leaves-of-Grass][Leaves of Grass]] is a Twilight fanfiction, and it's one of the best I've ever read in any fandom. It starts at the end of New Moon. After returning from Volterra, Bella isn't sure if she wants to get back together with Edward. She takes a nap and wakes up in the midst of the Civil War, and encounters Jasper before he was turned. It's Bella/Jasper and very well done.
