Twilight -

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6137139/1/Luminosity][Luminosity]] is a HPMOR inspired fic, but is, from what I remember, much, much better than HPMOR. The inspiration is limited to Bella's personality being less emotion and more rational thinking. It does a pretty good job of exploring the world. It's best read on the author's site, and can be found [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/all.shtml][here]] all on one page. It's sequel is [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/all2.shtml][Radience]] and there is a collection of stories called [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/all3.shtml][Flashes]]. Bella/Edward

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4446127/1/Golden-Slumber][Golden Slumber]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4453118/1/The-Edge][The Edge]] is a Bella/Alice story that picks up at the end of book 1. It's not perfect, but I really liked it.

Bleach -

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4423123/1/Odalisque][Odilisque]] is an AU IchiRuki. Haven't read it in a while, but I remember it being good.

Naruto (First Set) - I think all of these are excellent and you should seriously read them if you haven't already.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8550403/1/The-Howling-Wind][The Howling Wind]]. My absolute favorite Naruto fic. AU, with a Naruto that has a chakra dysfunction that forms the base for the story. Unknown pairing. Could end up with Naruto being with Samui, Hinata, Sakura, or someone else. The author isn't sure yet.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10822184/1/Written-in-Reverse][Written in Reverse]]. By the same author as The Howling Wind and probably my second favorite fic. It's a Naruto/fem!Sasuke in which they are both thrown back in time, but neither knows about the other.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9948266/1/Team-7-s-Ascension-Blood-Wings][Team 7's Ascension: Blood Wings]]. This is an AU with a realistically dark world given it's status as a warrior culture and which does an absolutely excellent job of representing the power difference of the various shinobi levels. It's a Team 7 fic. Probably going to end up a Naruto/Sakura/Sasuke pairing. Along with The Howling Wind and Written in Reverse, it is one of my favorite stories of all time, including all of the published fiction I've read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3745099/1/People-Lie][People Lie]]. Another dark world. Very AU. Features a very OOC Naruto that was heavily influenced in childhood by Ibiki. It's Naruto/Hinata.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3183054/1/Tempered-in-Water][Tempered in Water]]. This is also a realistically dark story. It's premise is that Naruto was successful in his attack on Haku when she asked that he kill her. She survives, but his eyes are opened to the true realities of the shinobi world. Naruto/Haku.

Naruto (Second Set) - I also recommend all of these, but some have some issues and others I just don't like as much as those in the first set.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3149411/1/Naruto-Altered-History][Naruto: Altered History]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4568723/1/Naruto-Shinobi-Wars][Naruto: Shinobi Wars]]. This one is a very dark story in which Naruto ends up being taught by Anko. If the writing was better in the beginning I'd have included it in my first set. It's one of my favorite stories. It's Naruto/Ino with a twist of Naruto/Yugito.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3430516/1/Lost-soul][Lost Soul]]. Like Altered history, I'd have included this story in the first set if the writing was better early on as it is also one of my favorites. This story's basic premise is that Sarutobi allowed Naruto to be made into a super-soldier. It's old enough that a lot of the Naruto world hadn't yet been created so the author had to build a lot of his own. I think he did a wonderful job of it. It's Naruto/Temari.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3568608/1/The-Book-of-Naruto][Book of Naruto]]. A very funny Naruto story that has Naruto set up as a god after the Wave mission. By the same author as Tempered in Water.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9486691/1/Sage][Sage]]. This one is a very good story in which Naruto awakens the Rinnegan after Teuchi and Ayame are killed because of him in his early life. My main criticism of it is that it includes various filler arcs that sometimes make it drag. I won't include this one's pairing because it would be a spoiler.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3541463/1/Genius-of-Konoha][Genius of Konoha]]. In this story, Naruto is a true genius on a level that is very close, or slightly above, that of Itachi.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5012103/1/That-Look][That Look]]. In this story, Anko comes across Naruto, feels bad for him, and befriends him under the guise of being another child. It's Naruto/Anko.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5166693/1/Scorpion-s-Disciple][Scorpion's Disciple]]. In this story, Sasori leaves the Akatsuki and ends up in hiding in Konoha. He ends up teaching Naruto and Naruto becomes a puppet user.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6076235/1/Unplanned-Paternity][Unplanned Paternity]]. In this story, Kakashi is charged with caring for Naruto. He begins doing so grudgingly, but a real bond develops.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8212573/1/Rewritten][Rewritten]]. Naruto is thrown back in time in this story to before his father become Hokage. Naruto/Mikoto.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3883902/1/The-Ghost-and-the-Darkness][The Ghost and the Darkness]]. In this story, Naruto has been driven insane by the Kyuubi and Sasuke also develops his own issue from the massacre. They end up forming a sort of friendship.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4860864/1/Who-I-Am][Who I Am]]. A story in which Naruto is blinded early in childhood. Sasuke is his best friend and helps him hide his disability. By the same authors as Unplanned Paternity.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6557238/1/Better-Left-Unsaid][Better Left Unsaid]]. This is a for-want-of-a-nail story, IIRC. It drags on a bit, but I remember liking it a lot. Naruto/Ino.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6051938/1/The-Sealed-Kunai][The Sealed Kunai]]. In this story, Naruto was trained by Danzo as a member of Root. When he was 8 or 9, he was discovered returning to Konoha by Jiraiya and Sarutobi and Jiraiya seal his memories in an attempt to return him to a normal childhood. This is a Naruto/multi, but I don't think it's like most harems. Naruto isn't so much dating multiple girls as he has several fuck buddies. There is no final pairing, but the general assumption in the story seems to be that he'll eventually end up actually dating one of them and be monogamous.
