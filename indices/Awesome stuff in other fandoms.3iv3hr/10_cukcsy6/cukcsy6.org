Check out Time Braid by Shaper V: Linkffn(5193644)

It's a Naruto story. A Groundhog Day inspired time loop that goes somewhere, and is really damn good.

Also, the author mentions Perfect Lionheart as an inspiration. I'd honestly avoid the guy's work, so much of it just spins its wheels and accomplishes nothing other than loading a ton of chekhov's guns that never get fired, because almost everything is abandoned.

What else...

Stars Fade: Linkffn(8123345) is a Mass Effect and Dragon Age 2 crossover.

A Demon Among Devils: Linkffn(10225608) is a Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 crossover with Highschool DxD, and is amazing despite slow updates.

Cast in Gold is an Evangelion and Exalted crossover: Linkffn(7057744)

Can you tell I like crossovers?

Also a lot of authors have favorites lists with at least a couple things worth taking a chance on, so dig through them relentlessly.
