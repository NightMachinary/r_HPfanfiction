  In unity lies strength; each leaf is important or the beauty of the tree is lost. Some bonds, however, are difficult to forge and even harder to keep. The tide of blood nears, the drums thunder, and three Genin stand tall as the world spirals into madness. [AU]

  It was their last, desperate gambit. Their last hope. They pinned everything on a prayer that he could save them...and now...he's not even sure if he can make it count anymore.

  Minato managed to kill Tobi on the night of the Kyuubi attack. Naturally, the Elemental Nations are one step closer to peace. Or are they? One villain falls, but another will rise and that villain is human nature itself... along with his sociopathic son helping things along the way. Dark Naruto, Alive Minato and Kushina, Jinchuuriki sister, Not a neglect fic, No bashing.

  AU in a more modern urban setting. Will be EPIC in length. Things aren't as they appear in this world. With a normal life out of reach, can Naruto figure out the mysteries that surround his existence and survive long enough to cash in on the potentially lucrative (and dangerous) career path of the mercenary? ...Either way it beats actually working for a living.

  There's something to be said for keeping the past as it was - makes it predictable, malleable. Naruto never bought those arguments. He's always been the one to power through adversity rather than wait it out, so why would now be any different? He'll do what has to be done, even if he steps on a few butterflies along the way.
