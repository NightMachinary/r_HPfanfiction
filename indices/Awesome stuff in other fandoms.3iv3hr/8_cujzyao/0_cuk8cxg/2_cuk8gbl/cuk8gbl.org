  Naruto's chakra is warped at birth. Instead of strengthening his body and mind, it shrieks and wails like wind through his coils. Thrust into a war of ruthless shinobi and roaming Bijuu, he'll need the resolve to fight through his greatest weakness and survive- or, the determination to make it his greatest strength and win. (Lovecraftian AU)

  I know this a dream, a fabrication of a mad man's belief he could control everything. But still, when he said those words to me, those words that I had longed to hear for so many years, how could I want to go against it, how could I not want to believe it. Finally everything is perfect, if this is a dream, I don't want to wake up. "Then don't. Don't wake up. Stay here with me."

  AU. In the aftermath of the KyÅ«bi attack, Sarutobi Hiruzen ponders his greatest dillema yet: the fate of one Uzumaki Naruto. Fortunately - or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it - another Uzumaki still lives. Will be epic in length.

  What would happen if Naruto was in the wrong place at the wrong time? What if Itachi decided that he needed another failsafe to measure his potential besides Sasuke? Maybe it wasn't his sharingan that made him so strong... What if it was just him?

  "My name is Naruto Uzumaki. I don't have chakra. I can't walk on walls, I can't breath fire, and I certainly can't make a clone of myself. Who cares? I'm awesome anyway." Can Naruto be a good ninja in a world where everyone BUT him has superpowers? Yes. Yes he can.

  "Her face. I remember her face." A boy trained to kill is brought into the light. Grey, different Naruto heavily stealth based and Root trained, but not in the traditional sense. How will he cope with that most dangerous of foes: emotion?

  Uzumaki Naruto was born to be a shinobi. He was supposed to be a killer; a protector of unparalleled skill. His lineage and the demon in his gut ensured that. In canon, his growth was stunted. In here, he had a reason to be strong. He has to survive. AU.
