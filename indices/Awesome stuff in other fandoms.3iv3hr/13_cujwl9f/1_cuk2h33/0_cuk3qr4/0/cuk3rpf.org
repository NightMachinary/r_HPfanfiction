  Percy Jackson is a demigod. But he is not a son of Poseidon. He is not even Greek. A Norse goddess has her sights set on Midgard and Percy is the last of his people left on earth as he awaits his destiny. To reach it, grudges and prejudices must be forgotten and he must find acceptance in a world in which he does not belong. AU of Percy's life as a Norse demigod.
