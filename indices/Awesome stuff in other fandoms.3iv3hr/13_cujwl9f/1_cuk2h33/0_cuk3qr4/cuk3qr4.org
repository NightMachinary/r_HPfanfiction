Alright here are a few of my all time favourites. I will warn you I don't really ship Percy/Annabeth so I don't have any recs for that ship. I ship Percy/Artemis and Percy/Zoe mostly.

Anyway here are my recs.

All of these are really good IMO. I have reread all of them and they are great, even after a few rereads. That Colour Silver is especially good.

Have you got recs for any fics? Any other fandom you like is fine. I usually read Star Wars, Harry Potter and Percy Jackson fanfics but I read pretty much any Harry Potter crossover. Just no slash really. Maybe it's time to branch out a little?
