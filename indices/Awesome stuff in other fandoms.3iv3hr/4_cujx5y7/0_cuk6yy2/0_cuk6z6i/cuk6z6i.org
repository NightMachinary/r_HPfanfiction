  Immortality is a hell of a lot less fun than it sounds, especially when all you want is to be left alone but your conscience won't let you. Harry Potter and his usual bipolar luck live on into the 22nd century, his saving-people-thing meshing nicely with the galaxy's pressing need for a hero. Rated M for unrepentant coarse language, innuendo, and eventual sexy shenanigans
