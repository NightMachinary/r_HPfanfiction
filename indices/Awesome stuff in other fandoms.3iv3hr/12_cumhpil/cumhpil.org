[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6749059/1/Sideline-Collision]] This is kind of a long thread, so sorry if someone has already suggested this story. Twilight Bella/Edward humor/romance story that is a nice long read. It literally had me laughing out loud for most of it. There is also a nice long sequel being written once you finish this one
