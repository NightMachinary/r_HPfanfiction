You should start by checking out Lord of The Land of Fire's Naruto stories. He is very good. Personally, I have only checked only two of them so far ('The paths we choose', 'That Look') and liked them a lot.

Edit: So, the Op comes from reading a Naruto fic... I suggest Naruto fics. Apparently that calls for downvoting.
