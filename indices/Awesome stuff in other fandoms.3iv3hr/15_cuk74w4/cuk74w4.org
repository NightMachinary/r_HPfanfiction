[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1295005/chapters/2686486][Off the Line]]. FFVII fic. In which Cloud gets a Virtual Reality Dream Console -- ShinRa's latest in virtual reality technology. Aaand everything pretty much goes downhill from there. Warning for slash.

The only FFVII I'm keeping track of currently. Crackish fic, although there are hints of a deeper storyline running throughout. Esama also has a -lot- of fics for a variety of fandoms, most of which are great.
