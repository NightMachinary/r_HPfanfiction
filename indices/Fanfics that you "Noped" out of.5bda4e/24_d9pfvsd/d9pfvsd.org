I /almost/ noped out of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11950451/1/A-Different-Professor][A Different Professor]] when Harry asked Hermione to be his girlfriend because he's been having feelings for her. It sort of appeared out of nowhere, and doesn't really add anything meaningful to the actual story (which is pretty good) beyond any cheesy teen romance. "Oh noes! He forgot our magic mirror date! Let's give him the cold shoulder for a week!"
