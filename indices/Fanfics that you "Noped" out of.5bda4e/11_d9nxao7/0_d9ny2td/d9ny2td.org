  I noped the fuck out of that one when 12 year old Hermione blows 12 year old Harry. That fic has some serious underage porn in it. Absolutely disgusting.

I'm not sure that's the only reason (I noped out at the same point). I've read other fics or even Novels with underage sex (A Song Of Ice and Fire for example) that didn't disgust me in such a profound way. It would be interesting to find out why that scene feels so sick/perverse to so many people... probably has something to do with the fact that she is trying to reward Harry for rescuing her (if I remember correctly) and /that's/ the first thing she thinks of? I think that's a big red flag for a child that has been sexually abused. There's just something profoundly wrong with that scene.
