PoS is... a mixed bag. It's plotted well and takes pride in subverting a lot of HP fandom tropes. I appreciate how it's tried to flesh out the world and explain so many inconsistencies and oddities of canon.

That said, there's something irritatingly smug about the whole thing. Like, HPMOR smug. The author seems to take pleasure in pointing out how unexpected this plot point was or how clever this character is. Maybe not helped by the constant wordy infodumps.
