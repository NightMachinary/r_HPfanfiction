A novel isn't that big a deal for me, too. If the story is compelling I can read through 100k words in two hours or so. My record is Myetel's /Spirit of Redemption/ linkffn(Spirit of Redemption by Myetel), clocking in at... 3.3M words without author's notes, in a week, reading about 7 hours per day.

I sometimes return to that fic because it is so good.

However, 80k words of trash is 80k words I could have spent reading some quality fiction, fan or otherwise. I don't mind reading a lot, but when that 'lot' is just flat-out /bad/ I nope out and go find something else.
