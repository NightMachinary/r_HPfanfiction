My problem with PoS was a very interesting opening scene that promised a good plot, with at least one or more multi-dimensional characters...

and then decided 'but before we do that, have several tens upon tens of thousands of words of the most clich√©, two-dimensional Gary Stu fanfic ever!'.

I've had people tell me it gets good after second year. They comically miss the point that they've read through an /entire novel/ worth of words to get to that point.
