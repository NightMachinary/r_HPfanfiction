I agree with [[/u/PM_ME_BABY_PANDAS]] here. It's pretty smug, especially the author notes. He constantly claims that he brilliantly subverted a cliche here or there, while most of his fic has the most cliches I've seen in a while. When is he actually going to subvert the bashing, the slytherin!Gary-Sue!SuperSmart!Harry, wrong-boy-who-lived shenanigans of the worst sort... etc? Maybe it's just a language problem, but subversion means undermining it, not blowing it up to the max (For example subervting the "Harry confronts Evil!Manipulative!Dumbledore cliche would be Dumbledore laughing in his face and killing/obliviating Harry outright, because it's stupid to openly confront the evil Dark Lord. Of course that ends a fic, but I couldn't come up with a better example on the spot).
