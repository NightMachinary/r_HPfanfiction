It's already done.

In the author notes,the author doesn't "claims that he brilliantly subverted a cliche" he simply explains what he's done. Not necessarily the best of ideas, but not what you say either.

The wrong boy who lived plot is subverted. Harry isn't the boy who lived at all in this story, his brother is.

Gary stu/super smart, didn't notice. At all. There are a lot of smart people in this story (pettygrew for instance) besides Harry. Harry himself has an evolution during the story. He doesn't seem invincible or better than everyone either.

There's no evil!Dumbledore in the story either. The reason why Harry has been sent to the Dursleys does seem a little farfetched, but I never seen it done this way before (a mistake that is recognized as such by his parents very early in the story) and really avoid the bashing.

The evolution of Jim (harry's brother) throughout the story is interesting. I find this Snape really cool, also.

If you want to subvert some cliche, you need to have some cliche first.

Subverting a cliche is indeed undermining it. For example, if Harry is sent to the Dursleys by parents that seek to protect him (and later admit their faults, at least to themselves) this cliche is undermined to me.

Evil!manipulative!Dumbledore kills Harry during their confrontation isn't a subvertion. The subvertion would be, harry confronts Dumbledore, and it turns out that Dumbledore isn't evil, is really on Harry's side, and really does everything he can considering the circumstances, despite having seem evil and manipulative before that point in the story. In your idea, the trope evil!manipulative!Dumbledore is played straight, no subverted. Or even Dumbledore could have a good reason to act the way he does (for instance, Dumbledore isn't evil, harry really is manipulated by the Horcrux and cannot be saved anymore so Dumbledore really acts for the better would be another subvertion, although maybe a little tough to pull off).

A really badass Pettygrew that betrayed the marauders for other reasons that cowardice, is another subvertion.

I'm sorry, but I'm really under the impression that we haven't read three same "Harry Potter and the prince of Slytherin. Because I never seen as much tropes being subverted in another HP fanfic.
