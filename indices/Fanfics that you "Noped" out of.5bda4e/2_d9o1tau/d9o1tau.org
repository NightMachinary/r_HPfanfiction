  I noped out of The Prince of Slytherin recently.

I always hear about how it starts weak and bashes characters, but only in the beginning, so I gave it a try. I couldn't handle the cringey dialogue. Characters that the author is fond of constantly give long victorious/malicious monolouges that all the passerby are incredibly impressed and frightened by and everyone is retconned to hate the characters that the author is not fond of.

I know that it's an AU, but I had to nope out when Madam Longbottom was like "Frank always said you were immature and horrible," in response to James being like "Howdy, how have you been? I was Frank's friend btw."

I was interested when I saw Sirius hated James in the first chapter because they were the best of friends, so how could that happen? But I didn't want to find out anymore after reading the above chapter because there probably wasn't a good reason at all.
