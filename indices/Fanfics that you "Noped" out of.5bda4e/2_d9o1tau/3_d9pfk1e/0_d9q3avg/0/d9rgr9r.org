I don't think so. If you remember the beginning of the fic, Theo has been adopted by Sirius. I think now we know why. The other character you're talking about would never agree to marry him, she is subjected to the spell.

Is say this plot line promises to be interesting. I, for myself, look forward for the moment them Theo's father pays the bill for that stunt.

This work really well. I was actually angry when I read it. It means it works.

I find this story epic so far. It's one of the few fics I'm really enjoying at the moment.
