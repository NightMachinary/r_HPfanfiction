Because James had friends, but the author retcons every single one away from him. I wouldnt be surprised if in later chapters, his wife and (other) kid said they didn't love him. Because why would James lie to Madam Longbottom? There isnt a reason, the author is just trying to make James seem as horrible as possible. And then right after she said that, Neville, who was with her, was like, "OOOOHH BURRNNNED" (basically :P). So James face turns super red and he's really angry and embarrassed.

I just cant take that this happens in EVERY single scene James is in in the entire story. There can be bad and evil characters in the world, but even they are respected by ignorant passerby. Even they have friends and families and redeeming qualities. The author also makes sure to tell us that /she is not, in fact, bashing James even though they obviously are.

The scene right after that is Lily running after Snape to explain her part in the crime that has everyone hating her and her family. Imo her monologue was well placed and well written because she barely spoke in the story previously. However, everything that Snape ever has to say so far is conveyed is a cringey speech despite him being one of the quieter characters. And of course he goes off on Lily about not being his friend and what she did to Harry (its a twin boy who lived story) even though nothing was even her (or James!) fault. Snape even says "I'm over you," which is the most out of character line I've ever seen from him.
