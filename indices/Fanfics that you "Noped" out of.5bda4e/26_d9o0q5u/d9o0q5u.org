I'm reading one now that I really should "NOPE" out of. It's so campy , cliched and ridiculous! It's almost worth the read just to giggle at every wrong thing in the fic. One in which Ron Weasley is an Overpowered King of Magic. Only reason why I'm reading it is I'm running out of fanfictions on my Kindle and it's a bit of a tide over thing
