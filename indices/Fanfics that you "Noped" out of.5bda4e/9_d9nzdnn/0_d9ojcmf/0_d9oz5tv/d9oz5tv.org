I've got probably 15 chapters to go (out of 175 or something?). But yes, I agree with you. I understand that Hermione lived another 8 years of life with a whole new perspective and different friends and relationship dynamics, but she totally became another character with hardly a semblance of her former self. Unfortunately, it was a character that I didn't particularly like.
