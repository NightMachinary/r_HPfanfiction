I'm in the process of noping out of Debt of Time, which is apparently a hugely popular fic. And I'm almost done with it, so given how long it is of a story, I feel like I wasted so much time.

Hermione is weirdly possessive and the growth that her character makes doesn't always seem very sincere, but rather forced. Seems like, toward the end, the author simply was trying to make a statement with this new found character growth, rather than trying to make it believable.

I simply got to the point where no amount of otherwise good writing or plot could keep my eyes from rolling out of my head
