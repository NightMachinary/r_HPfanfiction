Casting moonshadows

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3378356/1/Casting-Moonshadows]]

A hugely popular story.

I got far into and just started being more and more freaked out.

I haven't read it in years. My memory is that the story starts to derail and goes from fluffyish to dark and meandering very suddenly.

Vague memories of Sirius becoming an alcoholic when he's like 13.

Remus starts dying and his friends hide him in a toilet and he has all these creepy weird fever dream type things.

They're all just kids but there's like no adults involved at all.

I think there's creepy somewhat non consensual under age sex scenes.

Really derogatory themes about women being vapid sluts.

If anything, after I got a few chapters into the crazy it was his popular the story was that wigged me out.

I kind of want to reread it now.

Some of the forced marriage law stories are really weird too.

I read disguised affections more than once for some reason, and that's pretty fucking grizzly at times too.
