Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness, and I did it far too late. Somehow I wasted hours on reading two thirds of this pile of rubbish. The characterization is horrendous, especially Snape, Neville and any female character are unrecognizable. Female characters mostly play the roles of love interests, victims to be avenged or at best healers. The story claims to be canon-compliant, but that only means that it doesn't outright contradict any of the events Neville describes in Deathly Hallows. Some plots were downright ridiculous, like the infamous execution chamber scene, in which Percy was actually a polyjuiced Viktor Krum. With all these flaws mentioned, most of all I hated the constant glorification of child soldiers.
