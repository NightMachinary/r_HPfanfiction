I read it, in part, because it was creepy. Also because it was really interesting. Didn't read the sequels yet though.

If you dismiss everything that you find creepy, doesn't it mean that you'll end up reading only stories that make you comfortable. I find it would be a pity. If a story creeps you out, iut means it does something well. Too me at least.
