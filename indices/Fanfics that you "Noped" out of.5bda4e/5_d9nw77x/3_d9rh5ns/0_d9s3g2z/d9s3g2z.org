I've pushed my boundaries, and I have to draw the line somewhere. One of the first fics recommended to me was this Hermione/Snape story( Pet Project I think), and I was okay until the moment they actually did get together, and then it hit me how creepy it was with the age difference, and how most others in the story were "understanding" or temporarily frothing at the mouth. I finished it for the plot, skipping the rest of the romance, but that was the first and only one I read. Even timetravel fics make me slightly wary, but I will skip the romance if I have to.

The Alkahest also made me uncomfortable, being a Draco/Hermione story, but that was mostly because I didn't feel like the older Malfoys deserved the level of trust and acceptance they were getting, especially from Hermione. Apart from a couple of paragraphs, we don't really see them earning their good end.

The problem with Firebird's Son is that I have to read the creepy stuff to understand what Harry is, what his powers are and what's going on, I can't skip the smut like I do for almost all stories.
