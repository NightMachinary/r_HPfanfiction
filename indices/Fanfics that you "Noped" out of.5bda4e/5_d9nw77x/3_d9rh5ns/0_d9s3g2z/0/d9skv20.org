I didn't see any smut in Firebird's song. There's no depiction of sexual intercourse that I remember. If I'm not mistaken, everything was implied. Didn't read the other ones.

Yes, we all have our limits, what I mean is, it's a pity to drop a good story for something like that. I've seen people talking about pedophilia in Nightmare of Future Past, where there's just zero sexual stuff... I find it farfetched.
