  What I saw was a setup for a harem

In a way. I'm not there yet (so not before the first sequel). It isn't a set up for wish fulfillment, though. It's really about a totalitarian state dominated by a few witches, where wizards are considered dangerous and so are bonded to witches (the bond happen to weaken the wizard for some reason). It's a smart but really creepy distopy.

Not quite. It's actually inverted. The girls are trying to grope the guys, who do their utmost to avoid them. It's really messed up, there's nothing you could find attractive in there.

I'd say nothing stops you from reading a few more chapters to see if you like it. It's a very unusual fic.
