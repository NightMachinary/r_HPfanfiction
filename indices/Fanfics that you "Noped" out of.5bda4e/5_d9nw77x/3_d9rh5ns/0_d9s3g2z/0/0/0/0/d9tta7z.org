I haven't read past the first few chapters. What I saw was a setup for a harem, and permission to grope being granted, polygamy being a thing. I hate harems as much as I hate OOC pairings like Voldemort/Harry or Snape/Hermione. Have I got it wrong? Should I give it another chance? Also, if Harry is the only male aether, what did witches do to calm down before him?
