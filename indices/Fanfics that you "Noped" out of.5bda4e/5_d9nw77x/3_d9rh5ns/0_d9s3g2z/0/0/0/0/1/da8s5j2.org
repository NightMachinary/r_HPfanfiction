They're in a Harem. But [none of them want to be in it. they actually hate it. They start out being friends. Just friends. And that's all they really want to be. But the hell they live in doesn't allow that. they all want out. But they have no way out.](spoiler) I'd say it's the one harem fic you should give a chance. It really takes a hard look at a gender imbalanced society. It's a dystopian society that needs to be fought. It made me think a lot about our own society today, and how complex it really is to fight gender equality issues.
