Wish fulfillment?! You must have a strange definition of what's wish fulfillment...

It feels more like a distopy to me. I don't know about you, but I've got really no wish to live in this place. Or even visit it.

Their society is just hell on earth. If your wish is to live in a society like this, I'm no doctor but I reckon you must be very sick.

Firebird's son is extremely sexual in it's context. And yet there's no smut. Almost nothing graphic.

That it is so creepy is a good indication that the story works. When you read a distopy it shouldn't feel comfortable. If it felt so, that I would consider a good reason to drop it.
