That was part of the problem. Harry being an aether and the population thing, all the setting etc was creepy. In the average fic, you can ignore smut by skipping it, and keep reading the story. Some authors even warn you saying the next chapter has x going on. Here, it is integral to the story, and felt a lot like pervy wish fulfillment, no matter how much the others in the story claim that it is not sexual.
