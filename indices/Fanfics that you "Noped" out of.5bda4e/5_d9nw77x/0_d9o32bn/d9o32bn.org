I finished because there were honestly elements that I found interesting, but I had to walk away from the screen and take a break too many times.

I liked the look into a society built on a different gender balance. I really loved the idea that there were legit, physical differences between magicals and non magicals. I didn't much like the groping, but it wasn't done in a super sexual manner so I let that slide.

I hated the "men cannot resist a naked woman so it's never their fault" excuses. I disliked how much emphesis on a woman's worth was put on her ability to produce babies. I hated the atmosphere of Harry being surrounded by shrieking, irrational, jealousy-filled girls and the only thing that could calm them was a piece of his magical wang.

I finished and hated myself for reading the entire thing in the hope that the parts I liked would somehow overshadow the parts that I hated. It never happened, and was only wishful thinking on my part.
