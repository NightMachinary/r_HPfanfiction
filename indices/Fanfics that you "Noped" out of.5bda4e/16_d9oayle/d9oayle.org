I now absolutely soured on time travel fics trying to maintain the "time line". I tried to reread *Backward with Purpose I* yesterday, and had to stop because the protagonists appeared awfully stupid to me.

For example, they let Dumbledore and Snape in their plans right from the start, and they knew the nature of Quirrelmort. So instead of playing out the 'time line', a better and far less risky solution would be to capture Voldemort, force him to spill all his secrets, obliviate him back to infancy, douse him with Draught of Living Death, and lock him behind wards stronger than Nurmengard.

Other Year 1 actions should include:

- Capture Wormtail and free Sirius Black
- Buy a few Goblin made weapons, open the Chamber, use Harry's Parselmouth ability to control the Basilisk, and imbue those weapons with its venom. They didn't necessarily need Gryffindor's Sword.
- Send anonymous tips about Barty Jr to Amelia Bones, that should get Jr kissed and Sr locked up forever in Azkaban (as payback for Sirius)
- Having established credibility with the Barty Jr tip, send another one about Lucy's secret stash under his drawing room. That should net them the Diary and Lucy's extended vacation with dementors. Force Narcissa to sell out Lucy for Draco's sake, and confiscate significant amount of Malfoy assets.
- Next, Dumbledore worked a little politics/magic to have the Lestranges killed, with Bellatrix being the last. Sirius and Andromeda would then inherit the Lestrange vault, get the Cup, and pay compensation to the Longbottoms.
- With most horcruxes and Lucy gone, they now had some time to enjoy Hogwarts a little bit and find a solution to Harry's scar.
- Harry, Sirius, Andromeda, and Longbottoms should control large amount of resources by now and would influence Fudge to behave better. Getting rid of Umbridge should also be easy. They could further invest their money in tech stocks just to maximize future returns.

If you have advance knowledge, you better put it to good use instead of trying to repeat the "time line".
