That's far more interesting than 'keeping the timeline ' bullshit. I want to see protagonists coming up with a good plan and encountering unexpected problems. The plan they had in BWP was utterly insane, risky, and stupid.

Although I made an outline of potential actions that sounded good, things still could go seriously wrong:

- Voldemort made successful escape (not likely though if Dumbledore was on the ball. He could just invite Quirrell for a chat in his office and trap him there)
- Wormtail got away (not likely if AD and Harry were on the ball)
- Amelia Bones was not cooperative, such as going after Barty Sr or searching Malfoy Manor (likely because she might not be such a good person described in many fics)
- Lucy got inside tip and managed to hide his stuffs, now the location of the Diary would be a mystery (very likely)
- Goblins were not cooperative and refused to yield Lestrange vault under any circumstance (very likely)
- The good guys were having major differences and falling out among themselves (likely if the main threat had diminished)
- Protagonists had major psychological issues after getting rid of their main threat (very likely).
- Past friendships might not form again, such as Ron failing to make friend with Hermione because he was different now (likely)
- Good guys from previous timeline, especially the kids, had new experiences and might turn out the opposite way (likely)
- Harry and Ginny couldn't control themselves, and Harry alienated the rest of the Weasleys (likely)

I mean the possibilities for new problems are pretty much endless, and none of them would involve 'keeping the timeline' nonsense.
