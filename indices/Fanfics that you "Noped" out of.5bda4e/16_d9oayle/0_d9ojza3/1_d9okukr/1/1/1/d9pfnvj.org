That tended to happen in /Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past./ Harry knew what was going to happen, and then tried to adapt accordingly, but Fate, or some other third party, kept interfering and trying to keep things "on schedule."

On a related note, I read some of /Backwards With Purpose,/ but lost interest when the author used Seer!Luna. In /NoFP,/ Luna's a little weird, but much closer to canon.
