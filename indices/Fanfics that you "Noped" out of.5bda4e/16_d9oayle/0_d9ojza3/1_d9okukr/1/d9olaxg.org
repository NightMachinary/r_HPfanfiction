Generally, I think that if a story is going to be interesting, you have to fear for the ability of the characters to succeed. If you know in advance that they're going to be fine, that they're going to achieve all their goals and there will be nothing in the way, then there's no point in reading since you already know how it all turns out.

If you want your heroes to have an easy time achieving their goals, then yes, there's loads of wish fulfillment fic out there, but again, to me it's boring stuff with very little to recommend it. However, if it's the sort of thing you like, hey, enjoy. Everyone has their tastes.
