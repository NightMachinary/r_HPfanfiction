In time travels such as this, where their advance knowledge could be used to maximum effectiveness, defeating their former enemies should be EASY, unless the author forced things. I ABSOLUTELY hate those forced conflicts now. However, this doesn't mean the time travelers would have it easy for themselves, because they were most likely severely damaged people and their integration into new realities could prove difficult, such as in:

*A Little Child Shall Lead Them*, linkffn(10871795)

*Ginny Returns*, linkffn(4740107)

*Returning to the Start*, linkffn(10687059)

*BWP I* used to be one of my top favorites. I read it a few times so I know what I'm talking about. This fic is especially suitable for new fanfic readers who just finished the original series. But I have moved on, and canon rehashes have become my number 1 pet peeve.

[[/spoiler][Speaking of ASP's meddling, he only came back because his parents and Ron already made one trip back. Harry got hit by some nasty curse from Voldemort and died 25 years after his victory. ASP was pretty upset about it and tried to 'improve' things. Well, he fouled up colossally on his first trip. That was why the prophecy became public knowledge, that was why the 'bent on always and always' got included in the prophecy wording, that was why Rookwood knew about things, and it was him who wrote that article.]]
