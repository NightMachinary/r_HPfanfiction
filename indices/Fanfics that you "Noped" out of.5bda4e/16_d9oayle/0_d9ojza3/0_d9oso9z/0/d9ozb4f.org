Read "Backwards With A Purpose" and see for yourself. I was kind of shocked at how tightly plotted it was. I'm sure there must be some minor mistakes, but I was unable to discern them, and it would likely take effort to notice them if they're there. (This is especially surprising given that [[/spoiler][there are multiple intersecting changes being made to the timeline and the author kept accurate track of all of them.]])

On top of that the prose is just wonderful, which is a rarity in fanfiction.
