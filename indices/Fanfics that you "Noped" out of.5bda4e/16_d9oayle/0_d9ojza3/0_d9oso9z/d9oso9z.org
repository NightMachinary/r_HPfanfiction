That's certainly not true of /any/ work of fiction, let alone an unpublished fanfiction.

Just because silly decisions/plot points are justified at the end doesn't make it a perfect fic. For a more extreme example, see HPMoR. The protagonist is arrogant and cold; the reason for this is explained at the end in a rather intriguing way, but that doesn't excuse the reader having to sit through 100 chapters of a horrible protagonist.
