/Backward With A Purpose/ has no mistakes. It is amazingly well written both from a plot mechanics point of view and from the raw quality of the prose. On the plot: the author was obsessive, planned out everything in advance, apparently overhauled the whole thing several times before releasing it to make sure the entire thing was internally consistent, and there are /literally no plot holes/. (Any hole you think is there has an explanation by the time you hit the end.) If you think a character in that story is doing something stupid, there's a reason for it, and that reason is [[/spoiler][that they're all being manipulated by another time traveler, which becomes obvious as the story progresses and is confirmed at the end.]]

The alternative story you describe, btw, would be horribly boring wish fulfillment as there would be no conflict in it and it would be over in thirty pages. For a story to be interesting, there needs to be conflict and struggle, or there is no suspense, no reason to continue to read.

If that's the sort of story you want, there are, of course, literally hundreds of poorly written Peggy Sue fics with similar plots out there. Half of them start with Harry buying a special magical trunk and somehow charming the Goblins by knowing their culture. /Those/ are stories that I "nope" out of, btw.

By contrast, /Backward With A Purpose/ is probably the best Peggy Sue fic ever written, and coming anywhere close to it in quality would be damn hard.
