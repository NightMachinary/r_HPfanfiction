Yeah I never understand that in stories when they don't realize they can use their magic for profit in the muggle world. Upholding the statute of secrecy should be a no brainer if you avoid illegal stuff and just be low profile. As long as you don't try to be a millionaire you should be able to live super comfortably and on top of that you'll be revered by your peers too because you're an asset.
