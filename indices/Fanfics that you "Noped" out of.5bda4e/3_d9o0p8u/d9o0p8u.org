Can't remember the last fic I honestly noped out of, but I had one I was very, very, close.

I read the Inquisitor Carrow series, and in the beginning I honestly loved it. I found it very funny having Harry come back after spending centuries in the WH40K Universe.

My problem with this story came late into it, when the author brought in a personal pet peeve of mine.

It comes out later in the story that something like 5-10% Muggleborns leave Britain for greener pastures, the rest however, are either Janitors, Magical Criminals or Prostitutes.

First, there's the fact that Dumbledore is a true leader of the Light in this, not some manipulating Dark Lord, yet he has apparently never noticed that he doesn't see or hear from graduated muggleborns much.

Second and most importantly, THEY HAVE MAGIC, HOW CAN THEY BE SO POOR THEY'RE WILLING TO SELL THEMSELVES.

This is an incredible pet peeve of mine. In canon Harry Potter, the Weasley's are somewhat poor, but that can be explained by the fact that they're Purebloods and know next to nothing of the muggle world.

Also, in canon we're told that the Ministry have some magic detectors, which are used to search for underage magic, this is why when Dobby uses magic at 4th Privet Drive, Harry is the one who is found guilty.

What does this mean? It means, most likely, that there are very few of these magic monitors around the country, that would mean muggleborns can perform magic freely, so long as they aren't seen.

Now, all of this was leading up to that I can't understand how muggleborns, people who lived in the muggle world can somehow loose their collective intelligence and not use magic there to earn money.

They can visit scrapyards and use the Summoning Charm to find gold, or the Mending Charm to fix broken things which they can then resell.

And let's not forget, shouldn't it be so simple to steal from muggles using magic? Some kind of switching charm or something else?

Anyway, sorry for the somewhat rant but I get frustrated when authors try to create a grimdark setting, but they fail to actually put in the effort to make that grimdarkness make sense.
