I have done it a few times, but not as often as one would think. I might "skim" a story faster but it takes a lot for me to completely give up. The only one I remember was because it was recent. I "noped" out of "The Greengrass Contract". I liked many of the ideas behind the plot, but the writing was medicore and the execution was just terrible. I couldn't take any of it seriously and there was so many mood swing and attitude changes and back and forth flops amongst the characters that it gave me whiplash.
