I dropped HP and the temporal bacon on the spot in the scene where Harry and Hermione get together in the chamber of secrets. The dialogue where they confess their feelings to each other just pulled me out of it. I was enjoying the fic up to that point, but this scene I couldn't bear. Just to dumb, I guess.
