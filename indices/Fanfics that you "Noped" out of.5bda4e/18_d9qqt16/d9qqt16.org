I usually nope out of stories if there is a sudden marriage contract. I also nope out of a story if a character shows a irrational hate (That isn't part of someone manipulating them) Like in (I think the name was) 3 slytherin marauders. Neville becomes a cunt for no reason. Sure the reason was that Harry now had parents and is living a better life than him but he didn't, but we don't see Neville hating everyone else? That was one of the main things I had wrong with that story. It basically made Neville an antagonist just because.
