I "nope" out of stories constantly. My policy is to avoid feeling like I need to continue when something starts to suck. (This is ignoring all the stories I wouldn't even start because the description itself includes misspellings or grammar problems, and all the ones I read three paragraphs of and think "hrm, no, I don't think I can read something this bad.")
