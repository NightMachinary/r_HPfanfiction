I nope out of poorly written fic frequently, but usually within the first chapter. The most notable time I had to nope out of a fix I'd already sunk a good amount of time into is "The Depths of Winter". I put up with a number of OCs, but I had to say nope to [spoilerish alert] a pretty predictable (I should have bailed sooner) plot twist in which a major character is both evil and poorly characterized. Ugh.
