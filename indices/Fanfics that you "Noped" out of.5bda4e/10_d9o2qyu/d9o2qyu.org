I don't have a specific one to give as an example, but I always Nope out of any fic that features the Dursleys beating/raping/starving/cursing at/enslaving Harry.

Yes, he was mistreated in canon, but not that badly. It always makes me a little angry because there ARE kids out there that those things are happening to, and the authors always just put it in their stories to make Harry pitiful but then he goes to visit the Weasleys and suddenly he's perfectly happy and well-balanced. That's not how it works. It's a cheap trick and I have yet to see an example of an author treating the subject with the respect it deserves.
