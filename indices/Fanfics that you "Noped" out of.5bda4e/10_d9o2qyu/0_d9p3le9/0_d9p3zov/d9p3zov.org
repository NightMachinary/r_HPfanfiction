When I say 'cursing' I mean really foul, way out there language. Not just a "damn" or "hell" tossed into the sentence. The Dursleys never struck me as the cursing type (too prim and proper), so it always seems overdone to have them screaming profanity and calling Harry every slur known to man just to amp up the abuse factor.
