Killing a female character, typically in a gruesome way, to make a man feel manpain, to motivate him to be more heroic, or to instigate some character growth.

While this can be done with male characters, male characters who are killed tend to be given a moment of awesome, or a heroic self-sacrifice, instead of just dying. Female characters being fridged tend to have their helplessness emphasized.
