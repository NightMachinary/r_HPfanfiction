I notice you're not asking equivalent questions of the person who said they couldn't stand Harry being Snape's son. If it's about improving the portrayal of women, you have to argue against it, but if it's a personal quirk, you let it slide? That's not showing any political motive. Not in the slightest.

  But, I've seen cases where this trope is executed flawlessly and tastefully

Considered in isolation. In the context of all the other fridgings, it's one more straw -- maybe a tad lighter than the rest, for what it's worth.

  The justification for this and the Bechdel Test is that a book that doesn't meet these standards is lazy

Nope. It's that representation matters (demonstrably, as much as people argue that everyone should be able to empathize and identify with any other human). It's because the /type/ of representation matters, not just having enough characters in each category.

  But do you think authors did it to be cheap, or that the did it because it was expected in the genre?

I'm consuming media, not probing the internal motivations of the author.

  What exact device, in this case, might they have used in its place?
#+end_quote

Unless it's my writing, that's not my problem. And in my writing, I have never and would never get into that situation in the first place.

If I give you specific options, you'll argue that they don't have precisely the same effect. And that's true. Again, not my problem. If your story requires you to make women helpless and brutally murder them in order to give a man a sad, your story isn't worth my time.
