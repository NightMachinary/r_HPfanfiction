I can't pretend to know what your statement means. What's a single-question rubric? I looked it up and I'm kind of confused as to what you mean by it here.

I was asking because I'm curious. It seemed to me like you were implying that the key difference in that example was the characterization. In which case it sounds like you were saying friding was acceptable in that scenario.

It's an honest question. No need to be so dismissive.
