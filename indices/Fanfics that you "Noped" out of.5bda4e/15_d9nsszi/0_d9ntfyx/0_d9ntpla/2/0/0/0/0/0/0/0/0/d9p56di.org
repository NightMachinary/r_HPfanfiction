Exactly, it wasn't that sudden, owing to the nature of the story and that it heavily involved cancer, you could probably guess one of them would die. That's a rather big contrast to TV Trope's definition of the term fridging--"any character who is targeted by an antagonist who has them killed off, abused, raped, incapacitated, de-powered, or brainwashed for the sole purpose of affecting another character, motivating them to take action." Is cancer an antagonist then? And he dies but isn't killed by another person and it wasn't solely to affect the protagonist, and he was well characterized beforehand.
