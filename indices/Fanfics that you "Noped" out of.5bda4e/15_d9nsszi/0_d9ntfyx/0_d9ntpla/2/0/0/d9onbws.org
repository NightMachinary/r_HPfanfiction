I didn't comment on the other dude because I didn't read his comment - probably because it wasn't there beforehand, or maybe because I'm blind. I /did/ pick out fridging because it is a fringe issue, one that holds my interest.

  But, I've seen cases where this trope is executed flawlessly and tastefully.

I don't know if I emphasized this enough when I said that. Let me rephrase it: I have /never/ seen a story:

#+begin_quote
  make women helpless and brutally murder them in order to give a man a sad
#+end_quote

I have seen stories that kill the person a man is /in love with/ in a brutal and unforgiving way, which then makes the protagonist sad. But I've also seen stories kill or maim a person that the /female protagonist/ is in love with, and the gender distribution of this trope is generally getting better as time goes on. I feel like you're trying to shove gender into a trope where no gender honestly belongs, because this juicy morsel of misrepresentation is too good to pass up. You're focusing on "brutally murdered" and "helpless" like the author isn't sad about killing off their character either, like these things aren't /supposed/ to provoke an emotional reaction in the reader.

Is /The Hunger Games/ suddenly a bad story because Peeta spends most of his time injured or brainwashed? Is /The Fault in Our Stars/ awful because Augustus has fatal cancer? Do you have a problem with the /trope/ or the /gender/ behind it?

That's the question I'm asking.
