    But, I've seen cases where this trope is executed flawlessly and tastefully.
  #+end_quote

  I don't know if I emphasized this enough when I said that. Let me rephrase it: I have never seen a story:

  #+begin_quote
    make women helpless and brutally murder them in order to give a man a sad
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

Much more than a rephrasing. In the first case, you need to have read at least two stories in which a female character was killed off in a tasteful manner. In the second, you must not have read any stories featuring fridging. It's the difference between "somewhere exists that isn't Cambodia" and "I've never seen a place that is in Cambodia".

The trope is depressingly common in video game plots.

  Is The Hunger Games suddenly a bad story because Peeta spends most of his time injured or brainwashed?
#+end_quote

That's not this trope. If it were, it would be a gender inversion of it, which is an improvement. Context matters.

#+begin_quote
  Is The Fault in Our Stars awful because Augustus has fatal cancer?
#+end_quote

Again, that's not the same trope. Nowhere near. That entire story is about Augustus and the fact that he is dying of cancer and the effect it has on him and those around him. He's given the characterization that is nearly absent in most cases of fridging.

#+begin_quote
  Do you have a problem with the trope or the gender behind it?
#+end_quote

Why do you think I brought up representation?
