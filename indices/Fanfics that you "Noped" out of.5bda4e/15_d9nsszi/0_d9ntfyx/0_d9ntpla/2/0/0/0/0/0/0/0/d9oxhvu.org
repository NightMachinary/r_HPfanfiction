The person who brought up /The Fault in Our Stars/ was trying to conflate major character death with fridging.

/The Fault in Our Stars/ is about characters with long-term, often fatal illnesses. The character mentioned was the main love interest, features prominently throughout the work, and dies in the end. At his introduction, it's made clear that he has a probably-terminal case of testicular cancer. In the end, he dies, probably peacefully. (I haven't read it.)

Pretty much nothing in common with fridging aside from a major character dying.

In general, you probably won't find a single, narrow, well-defined facet of a character's death that distinguishes fridging from non-problematic character death.
