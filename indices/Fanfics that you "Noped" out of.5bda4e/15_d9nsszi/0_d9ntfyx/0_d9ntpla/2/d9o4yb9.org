I feel like that's a poor reason to drop a fic. The idea of fridging is something you would find in the TVTropes school of literary analysis - they would tell you that the work was poor because it was exclusionary and the author was being tasteless. But, I've seen cases where this trope is executed flawlessly and tastefully, and the work is /still/ labeled as poor or lazy. The only sin of the author in this case was taking advantage of his reader's protective instincts.

(I'm not saying that it isn't an adequate measure of a book's quality, but using it as your metre stick might be a little excessive. And sometimes good books can have elements that you might consider strange or esoteric.)

I'll leave you with a question:

The justification for this and the Bechdel Test is that a book that doesn't meet these standards is /lazy/ - that the author could have employed another device at that moment that wouldn't be gender exclusive. (whether or not this trope actually /is/ gender exclusive is an argument for another date) But do you think authors did it to be cheap, or that the did it because it was expected in the genre? What exact device, in this case, might they have used in its place?
