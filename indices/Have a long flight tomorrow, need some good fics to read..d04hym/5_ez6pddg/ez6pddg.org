This one meets almost all of your requirements, other than time-travel.

A Maurader's Plan, wherein Harry is raised by Sirius after third year.

There are 865520 words.

The pairing is Harry/Hermione (when we get to it).

The worldbuilding, imho, is phenomenal.

And to top it off, it's a very logically progressed plot that follows it's own rules.

I love it, and I hope you like it as well.
