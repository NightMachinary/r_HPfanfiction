Ahh, that makes sense. I have been reading for years too but only recently started saving the stories I think are really good so my list is weirdly short. Well, here you go (if you haven't already read them)...

*Imprisoned Realm* By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/245967/LoveHP][LoveHP]] Words: 324,867 Really good, but dark as well. I think they did a good job with the world building, it's definitely unique. Harry is transported to another universe where the war is a lot darker while searching for the horcruxes. Of course, he gets dragged into the drama there but what is really great is the authors take on "other Harry". linkffn(2705927)

*Wind Shear* By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/67673/Chilord][Chilord]] Words: 126,280 A time travel fic where a slightly AU adult Harry is sent back to 1970. The pairing is Bellatrix/ Harry but the story doesn't have much romance in it. This isn't a very dark fic but it's not fluffy or anything. Time travel is difficult to do well but the author does a good job with it here. linkffn(12511998)

*A Riddled Universe* By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3997673/hazeldragon][hazeldragon]] Words: 102,269 Little bit of time travel, bigger focus on universe travel. Harry goes 'through the veil' and finds himself in a universe where Tom Riddle is just a good guy, a Healer. linkffn(8678567)

*A Stranger in an Unholy Land* By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/606422/serpant-sorcerer][serpant-sorcerer]] Words: 470,388 Another dimension travel! Harry's sent to a world where Voldemort never 'died' so the war never paused. Not /nearly/ as dark as Imprisioned Realm. linkffn(1962685)

I hope these are good for you! Some of my all-time favorites are Harry/Ginny pairings but I resisted, lol. Have a good flight.
