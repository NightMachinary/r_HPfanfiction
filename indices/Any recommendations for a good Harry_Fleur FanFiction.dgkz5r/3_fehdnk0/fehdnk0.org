linkffn(8135514) His Angel. One of, if not THE best romantic development Harry and Fleur get in a FanFic, the sad sing is:

1.- It's Discontinued

2.- The autor gives us a "final" and it hurts to read it, The best Fic with the saddest finale.

It's my favorite and the one I hate the most at the same time.
