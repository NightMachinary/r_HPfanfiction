Hermione would think it was an insult to academia to get up and leave. It took Trelawney to get her to pack it up and walk out of a class and that wasn't because of abuse but rather that divination was all smoke and mirrors. She has something to learn from Snape, even if he's an ass.

Harry was raised to take abuse. Snape is better than Vernon Dursley and the cupboard under the stairs.

Ron isn't that brave, especially in the early years. Besides, his Mother would skin him alive if she learned he ditched class and fear of that alone would keep him in his seat.
