No, I never meant that Beauxbatons is /actually/ better, that would just be 11 year old me blowing up at Snape. You're right, we don't know, but I was never a rational child. We do know Draco claimed Lucius considered Durmstrang, but that was probably him bragging that a)his father would be able to get him into a school his peers couldn't get into or b)just making stuff up and bragging.

And I wouldn't get expelled, I'd withdraw :P I think both Headmaster and Deputy would hesitate to expel someone, especially if there were no other options. At most, you'd get a suspension. I refuse to believe in the real world, rather than the children's storybook world, that Dumbledore wouldn't tell Snape to behave himself.
