We don't actually know if Beauxbatons is better- and we don't know if transfer students are allowed or students are allowed to go to school out of their home country or region. We don't even know if there are other schools besides Hogwarts in Britain, or if there are if they would take a student expelled from Hogwarts.

People have invented all this stuff in fanfiction that doesn't exist in the actual books.
