I assume you mean Sirius. The worst thing we know Snape did to Lupin was revealing his status as a werewolf, which caused Lupin to quit to avoid backlash.

Also, Snape had a totally reasonable reaction if you look at it from his point of view. Sirius Black was an escaped convict and Lupin was in league with him. Snape had no knowledge of Pettigrew being the secret keeper and he hated Sirius, so from his point of view he was doing nothing wrong and getting revenge.
