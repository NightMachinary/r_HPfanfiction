  After all, he did only request that Lily be saved, not the other two.

If you mean from Voldemort, there was no chance he would have spared Harry. If you mean from Dumbledore, do you honestly think he thought Dumbledore would only save Lily? There was no need to beg for his old enemy's life- obviously Dumbledore would save all the Potters. IMO Dumbledore was sort of stupid for pointing that out like it meant something, just by telling him Voldemort was after the Potters then all the Potters would be helped.
