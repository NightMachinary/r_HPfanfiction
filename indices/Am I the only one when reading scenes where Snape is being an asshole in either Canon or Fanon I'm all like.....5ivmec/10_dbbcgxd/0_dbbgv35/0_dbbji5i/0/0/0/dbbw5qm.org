Yes I can totally see him doing that, but if he follows that logic he has to blame himself because if he'd never become a Death Eater or had never reported what he'd heard of the prophecy to Voldemort than Lily might never have died either, which is something I think he knew well enough anyway. In a way I wonder if he felt so guilty about that, and had that much self loathing built up that as soon as anyone else even remotely close to sharing the guilt of Lily's death in his eyes was around he lashed out... hence his almost overwhelming need to see Sirius receive the dementors kiss... and the temper tantrum he threw when he escaped. I wonder now if that was more why he lost it that night instead of being upset about losing the Order of Merlin like Harry thought at the time... never considered that until now.
