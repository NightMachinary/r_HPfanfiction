I'm not usually one to defend Snape, seeing as I usually think people are too forgiving with him, but think of his perspective in this scene like the other commenter said. Apart from already hating Sirius and Remus, he still thinks Sirius is the one who betrayed the Potters aka Sirius is responsible for Lily's death. The rest are a bunch of cunfunded kids and another wizard he hates acting as an accomplice to Sirius. I think thats why he was so upset when Sirius got away and blamed Harry. He thinks just like James he put too much faith in Sirius. I wouldn't be surprised if Snape somehow blames James partly for Lily's death too, seeing as "it was his fault" for trusting Sirius (and of course later revealed as being Peter instead) as the secret keeper.
