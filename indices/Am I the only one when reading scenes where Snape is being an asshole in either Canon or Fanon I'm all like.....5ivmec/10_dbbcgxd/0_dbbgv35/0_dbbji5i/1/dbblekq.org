I'm going to try and look at that from Snape's perspective, three of the people there are probably confounded, one is a serial killer, and the last has been helping a serial killer get into a school potentially to murder students.

I'm pretty sure at the very least if that were the truth Lupin would have gone to Azkaban. Although it probably wouldn't have been hard to convince Fudge to have him kissed based on Fudge being Fudge.

Also, I don't believe Snape would have brought them directly to the dementors, he had a chance to do that after Harry and Sirius get attacked by the horde of dementors, instead he brought them back to the castle. I have a feeling he was going to do that either way, still intending for Sirius to be kissed with the minister there.
