Snape doesn't have anyone to be accountable to, unlike real life. Dumbledore would only intervene if he was physically torturing students or similar. And there isn't an alternative potions class to enroll in. So yes, you could walk out, make a stink to administration and transfer classes but the Gryffindors don't really have a choice.
