Maybe not as an eleven year old, but I walked out of a class in high school where a teacher was being mean to me several times. She always singled me out even though there was a girl who literally left in the middle of her talking and would just come back whenever she felt like it. Not to mention all the other normal, not listening to her kids (she was a permanent sub who was not good at taking charge of the class). If we were working on something and I just whispered to the person next to me, she'd yell at me. I had no idea why she would react so strongly to me. I started walking out though and my mom talked to her and the **principal (totally with an a not an i, right?) and she quit her shit pretty fast. She had tried to report me for walking out (let it be known, she never reported the other girl; my mom asked).
