Just read it, it's very close to Harry's canon depiction, and the story is very credible.

Harry is fighting for the exact same cause as before, against an incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. Just because he claimed the title of a dark lord doesn't mean he's throwing his lot with the likes of Malfoy.

The summary already stated that Ron and Hermione are with him. In the story you will find great interactions with George, Neville, Susan, and Fleur.
