I like [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1344409][FloreatCastellum's fics]]! They're canon-compliant and there are a lot of Harry-focused ones. I really liked [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18564532/chapters/44004838][Drunk in Love]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19106158][The Speeches]] in particular.

As a side note, if you don't mind slash I'd have more recs.
