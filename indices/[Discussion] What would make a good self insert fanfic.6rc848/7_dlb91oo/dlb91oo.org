Keep the stakes small, and keep the story short.

Write a small little adventure where the OC wants Harry's help to sneak out to visit a little first year that Umbridge has put into overnight detention.

Now you have a reason to spend time with Harry, you have a common goal to work towards and bond over, but because the setting is kept to one night, you don't become his BFF and usurp Ron and Hermione. Because you don't end up fighting Voldemort you can't make yourself too OP. Worrying abut whether that shadow around the corner is Snape or Flich or Umbridge still allows for a good deal of tension, and it keeps the plot grounded and believable.

What I'm saying is, at least save the sex for Chapter Two
