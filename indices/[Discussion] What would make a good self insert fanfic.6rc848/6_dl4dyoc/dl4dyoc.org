One way, I think, is to make your SI into an absolute nobody. I mean if we're talking about inserted into characters, don't have your SI become Ron or Draco or Dudley or Susan Bones or anyone from Harry's year. Do something creative and have your SI become Dirk Cresswell or Williamson the Auror or Ernie Prang. Don't stick to Hogwarts and branch out.
