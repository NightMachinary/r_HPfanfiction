What's the remaining stuff that makes self inserts interesting if you take out the wish fulfilment? Breaking the 4th wall? There are better and more interesting ways to do that.

I really don't see the appeal... what is there left to distinguish a self-insert with a fic featuring an OC? An OC which has the advantage that he can be interesting: Lets face it, most people are boring, I'm certainly not narcissistic enough that I as a character would be particularly intriguing in any story..
