They're not absolutely terrible, they just have to be approached properly, without idealising yourself when you create a character out of what you have. Better yet, if you are going to create a wizard/witch version of yourself, start with how you were at 10/11, all the good and all the bad and all the weird, and put that to writing.

A self-insert shouldn't take the spotlight, but it doesn't mean they can't influence things to /some/ degree, that they have to stay a background character. For example, and a big one at that, let's have a self-insert who wasn't really significant outside of believing in doing what's right who joined the DA and then managed to convince the others to let them tag with the group to the ministry because it's the right thing to do; sure, all that's happened there was a mess, but you only need one more person who would momentarily distract Bellatrix and Sirius has a shot at living (because she'd then proceed to crucio the offender, giving Sirius some breathing room), and even if the self-insert doesn't really do anything noteworthy from then on aside from being, it's still a change that really doesn't have to be bad. The key is restraint, don't have whatever the cahracter does be oh-so-great and the best thing ever and so on and so on and them the best friend ever, just have them be a /person/, with all the baggage that /that/ includes.
