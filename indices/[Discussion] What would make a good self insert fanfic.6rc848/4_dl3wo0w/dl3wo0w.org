If it were to work in my mind it would have to be an outside in. Magic exists, you're a muggle, prove it. Dodge the obliviators and work around muggle repelling wards to try and stay alive when Voldemort is raiding the muggle world and you can't say anything to anyone without dying.

Hindsight is the biggest curse on self inserts. Power wanks exist without SIs and while so does hindsight, its easily tempting in SI. The biggest part of the story is the journey not the conflict resolution. A self insert that knows all the loctions of Voldemort's horcruxes defeats the true purpose the hunt, to show the characters struggle and develop. A self insert that becomes the centre of the focus can go horribly wrong. Leave Hogwarts behind, delve into magic from the outside.
