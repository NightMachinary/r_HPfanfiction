I would like to read a fic that really plays on the self-insert wish fulfillment.

As in, the entire first chapter plays out exactly like the author wants to. And then, at the end of the chapter, there's the big twist. Nobody in this world cares that you want to make this a wish fulfillment. You still gotta play by the rules.

It starts when you get the enormous pricetags of all those cool multi-compartment trunks slapped in your face and your wand isn't made of thestral hair and ancient mahagoni, but birch and unicorn.

You get sorted into the House you really don't want, because lets be honest - you ain't sly and cunning and the bravest thing you did was to kill that very big spider by throwing a book at it.

Then nobody includes you. That is - none of the important characters. You make your friends, sure. But Philosophers Stone kinda plays out without you. You try to interfere, but an actual troll is hella scary - magic is way harder than you thought, and why the hell would the protagonists include you, anyway? You're a weird-ish Ravenclaw, bugger off.

And then you turn it around in later years. You realize that the knowledge of the book is not enough. You have to make a stand and actually carve out a place for you in this world. You're not getting Hermione, Ginny, Fleur,... - but by Merlin, that barely mentioned sidecharacter girl makes your heart pump a mile a minute. In the fight against Voldemort you do what you can, just the part with the active fighting scares the living hell out of you. Have you /seen/ Bellatrix Lestrange? Fuck. That. But you send the position of and traps around the Horcrux anonymously. Where would you get that knowledge if you're not a Death Eater?

In the end you stand at the side, applauding Harry Potter - a man who needs a second to remember your name - and are content in being there.
