Not sure if it's what you're looking for but I'm currently working on a Dark!Harry fic where Daphne acts more like Macbeth's wife... she corrupts him and encourages him to do the first kill because she wants to use his name and fame to climb the social ladder but he ends up enjoying the taste and becomes so bad that he even scares Daphne. It's not a major plot in my story though but if you were interested in my project and act as my beta reader, PM me.
