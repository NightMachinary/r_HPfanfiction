Well to be fair there are a lot of them out there. Also i ask mainly, because by the end of fourth year voldermort is back.

I would also like to point out that whether by luck, power or skill by that point in the story he had repelled dozens of dementers, defeated a thousand year old basilisk, helped stop the theft of the philosopher's stone, disarmed severous snape, and outflown a dragon. Even if he did almost end up dying if it weren't for Fawkes in COS.

Also side note i think in this scene i've got to ask if fawkes could bring the sorting hat why didn't dumbledore come himself. To me this just point's out to me not to mention a lot of other evidence that dumbledore wasn't exactly either right in the head or even downright malicious.

With all this evidence. Especially with the dementor's it shows that he has the potential to be quite powerful early on not to mention after in OOTP where he with a group of student's held off some of voldermorts top enforcer's/henchmen with little injury except a seriously injured hermione, and in that scene they weren't exactly going easy on them even if they weren't trying there hardest.
