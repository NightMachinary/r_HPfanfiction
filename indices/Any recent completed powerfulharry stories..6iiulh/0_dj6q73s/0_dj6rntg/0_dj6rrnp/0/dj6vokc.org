Oh i know it doesn't. That's why i just made a small quotation about it. Secondly explain all his failing's then. There seem to be too many for it to be a simple case of too much work. Even than he should be intelligent enough to know that working as a headmaster, and as somewhat of a leader for two high up government position's is not healthy nor is it a good thing, because he will never pay 100% attention to any given role. He should quit one or two of them.

Imagine a world where dumbledore's only job after the war was as head of the wizengamot. I mean if someone like malfoy could do all he did as just a malfoy not Albus FREAKING Dumbledore, defeater of Grindewald, friend of Flamel, ender of The first wizarding war, and agreed upon, the most powerful wizard alive if ever. I'm pretty sure he could do a lot for the world, but because he can't focus all his time on it he only does the basics, and a lot of stuff get's through that probably shouldn't, and maybe wouldn't with him there.

As much as the books show people like fudge getting into power there are good people in those position's that could take over. Even if there aren't you've got plenty of great teachers who can become headmaster/headmistress of the school like Minerva or flitwick well before any of that stuff happened in the books.

So overall he is at the least in belief that he knows what's best over everyone else, and therefore always right, and things must always go his way. Granted that would not be his fault completely with everyone around him always fortifying that belief.
