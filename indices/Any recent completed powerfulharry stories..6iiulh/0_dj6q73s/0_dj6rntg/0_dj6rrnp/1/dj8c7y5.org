That's a point of view, not a fact. He was very likely overworked... However there are quite a few folks out there who question just how manipulative Dumbledore was actually being throughout cannon (myself included).

There were certainly some things he knew WAY more about than he let on and still allowed them to happen or encouraged Harry and Co to face things they had no business facing. Just how much we will never know for sure, but JK herself has stated he knew things like Lockhart being a fraud and that he had suspicions about Moody. And he was very obviously guiding Harry along a path in very suspicious and dangerous ways.

At the end of the day even if he was not evil, or crazy, or whatever word you want to assign to him, he was most definitely not the benign friendly old man who was smart but somewhat oblivious. There were methods to his madness and some certainly seem awfully manipulative and malicious.
