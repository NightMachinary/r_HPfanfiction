My favorite current fic of this nature is an HP/GOT crossover by joen1801 called The Difference One Man Can Make. The first chapter is a bit shakey but oh boy does it pick up and become excellent. He updates on a regular basis.

Another HP/GOT base building fic is The Wizard of Harrenhal by DisobedienceWriter. I really, really loved this fic and it's finished which is such a plus. It's all about building up a magic town and taking over Westeros.

Another favorite fic like this is an HP/SGA crossover called Space Haven by Esama . It's 140k words and abandoned, but still well worth reading. The Wizarding World moves to Atlantis and re-architects their society. This is a popular trope for Esama so you might want to check out some of her other fics including her Island of Fire series [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/205025]].
