Harry Potter and the Freedom of Apathy, and its sequel kind of follow this idea.

Lord of Caer Azkaban has some of those elements.

Earl of the North, as well.

Not sure any of them are exactly what you're looking for. But they're not bad stories either way.

Edit: these all have something to do with Azkaban as well, which I only just noticed.
