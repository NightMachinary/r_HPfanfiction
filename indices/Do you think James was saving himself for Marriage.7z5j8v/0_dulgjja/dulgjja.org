I don't know but you just reminded me of this weird-ass fic I read years ago where female students who got knocked up would be put in a time bubble until they gave birth, then have their baby put up for adoption and their memory erased. That's where all muggleborns come from apparently and Lily was Molly/Arthur's from when they were like 14. Ewwwww I wish I hadn't remembered this
