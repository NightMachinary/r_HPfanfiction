There's a fic I just recently re-read that I think is called In Plain Sight, I can't remember the author but it's on ff.net. In the story Harry had gotten LASIK surgery to fix his eyes and no longer needed glasses. Him not wearing glasses was enough of a â€˜disguise' that no pure blood student (Ron and Ginny included)could recognize him. It also featured Moody and a team of Aurors pulling a /21 Jump Street/ assignment that fooled the pure bloods but did not fool students raised in the muggle world.
