In where after third year harry and sirius pool thier money and hire the world's most dangerous hit wizard to pose as harry. He casually follows potter around under an invisibility cloak all the time, and after teaching the kid some fancy slight of hand and a few acrobatics, Harry learns to seamlessly switch places with his "double" and hide under the cloak instead.

Only problem is, the hit wizard looks nothing like him. A hulking 6'10" wizard in peak condition, with a full Escanor like mustache. Clearly wearing prop glasses with no lenses, a messy black wig, and a fake scar painted on his head, squeezed into a students gryffindor robes and tie. The death eaters are clearly confused after confronting potter only for this stranger to turn around to his full hight and flex, tearing his uniform at the seams.

Avery opens his stupid mouth for the last time; "wait, your not potter!"

Hit wizard with Arnold Schwarzenegger voice: "and your not breathing."

Avery "what?"

"Reducto."

Avery's headless corpse falls backwards as the hit wizard's wand tip smokes. No one even saw him draw.

"Now say hallo to my little friend! The hit wizard has pulled what resembles a miniature hungarian horntail from... somewhere, and Malfoy does not like the ominous heat and glow emanating from it's wide open maw pointed directly at him.
