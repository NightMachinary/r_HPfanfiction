Well, points for honestly on what you like. Although I very much dislike fics like that (and I'm a rampant hinny shipper haha), luckily for you, there are a lot of long (I do admire the dedication) fics plots like that

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/The-Very-Best-of-DARK-HARRY/26271/3/4/2/0/0/0/0/][This community]] exists for Dark Harry fics and all the works are of pretty good length and since just browsing for a minute shows the fics mostly pretty popular, I'm assuming that they're well written too.

Prince of Slytherin, although WBWL, is probably a classic in that sort of genre, but since it's WBWL, James Potter bashing.

Trouble, if I'm being completely honest looks like something I wouldn't be a fan of but I'm biased on that front, it's fairly well received and it is multi, with Dumbledore bashing.

There's also Moratorium which I think I did get through but it was kind of bit edgy for my tastes, although I do love the author, they've got some pretty good works (fair warning though, this one is fem!harry, so while it is political, if you're not a fan of that trope, opt of it I guess).

All of the above are completed (with the exception of Prince of Slytherin which is ongoing, currently over a million words, and 134 chapter) and you can filter out the ongoing stuff in the community.

I'm not a huge fan (like at all) of Dark!Harry fics but a lot of them do seem like the authors put a lot of effort into them and they seem interesting to read, just not what I'm into but still, good luck!
