Baby name sites say it is pronounced Lou-see-us - think of Lucien and pronounce it the same - though I saw a site that said many Harry Potter fans incorrectly say “Loo-Shus”! Lol! I don't think the original Latin is relevant to today's pronunciation - we do have a soft c, and in most modern Romance languages, and in English, a “c” followed by an “i” or an “e” is soft.
