I just thought it was pretty humorous that some random baby name site was referring to how Harry Potter fans pronounce it! And as an illustration of incorrect pronunciation! It is a little weird, since it was pronounced correctly in the movie. But yeah, given the word and name bastardization in canon, Luscious Lucius is a pretty minor point!
