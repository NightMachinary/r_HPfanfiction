In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius][original Latin]], it is pronounced "Lukius", as "C" is always pronounced as "K" in Latin.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulla][Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] was a Roman dictator who had massacred many of his political enemies. JKR must hate this guy since she turned both Lucius and Cornelius into her villains.

"Lucas" and "Luke" are also derived from Lucius. So yes, you can actually call him Lucius Skywalker.
