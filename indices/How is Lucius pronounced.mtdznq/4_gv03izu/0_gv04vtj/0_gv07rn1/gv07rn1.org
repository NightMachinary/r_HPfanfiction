No no no that's not it. What I meant only applies to its own words. Czech is normally pronounced “check” as you said. But like I said, I don't know how to explain it because I have never really cared, you know?

But for a explanation:

Czech language means Český jazyk. And now imagine a pronunciation of individual letters and that's how you read it - you just bump them all together into a word. But, of course, if you try to pronounce it with English pronunciation then it's not gonna do the job.

But the easiest explain would be a word is. Don't read it as you normally do but try to pronounce i and s individually. That's pretty much how it works.
