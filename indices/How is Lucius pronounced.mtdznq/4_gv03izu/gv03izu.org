I feel so stupid that I can't even describe how I pronounce it xD. I mean, here I'm with czech language that pronounces letters as they are written... I'm not even kidding when I say that I don't know how to explain it even through I live with this language for almost 20 years now. But if you want to hear it then listen to it with google translator (it does a good job).

But if I should describe pronunciation of Lucian's name to the best of my abilities then it would be like this:

Lucius -> Lu-ci-us

Yeah.... Doesn't tell a shit about it.
