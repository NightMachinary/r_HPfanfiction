ik people generally don't like the Black Queen series for how dark it is, but it does have an interesting take on seer!Luna- in that series, Luna sees emotions and waves of magic as imaginary creatures.

in some works (i'd recommend the author Colubrina for this,) they're metaphors that she uses to mess with people. there's one fic- idr the name or author, sorry- where the Quibbler is literally a satire magazine, and none of the kids realize that until later.

there's one very good fic called "It's Always the Quiet Ones" or something like that where her mother's family inspired Lovecraft's novels. she can see eldritch monstrosities and whatnot. and she casts a spell to make everyone see them too and it basically breaks everyone's mind and it's SO fun.
