A long time ago I had a plot bunny for a post-epilogue time travel story that was based around a Death Eater going back in time to assassinate Harry.

From my plot bunny doc:

#+begin_quote
  Post-DH epilogue compliant time travel story where it's a Voldemort sympathiser who goes back in time, not Harry. There's a break-in at the Department of Mysteries and Auror Harry goes it investigate under his invisibility cloak. He arrives just in time to see a mysterious wizard in the time room fiddling with an artefact. A magical backlash knocks Harry out.

  When he wakes the world has changed. His scar tingles: Voldemort is alive. He quickly realises that he is living in a dystopian world where Voldemort was never defeated.

  After some near-misses with the authorities, Harry finds the remnant Order, who are very suspicious of him. Harry learns that he was killed in his summer before sixth year, assassinated by a mysterious assailant. It becomes clear: the wizard in the Department of Mysteries went back in time and killed Harry.

  Harry tries to persuade the Order to make one last effort: they have to get Harry into Voldemort's Ministry so he can break into the Department of Mysteries, go back in time and prevent his own assassination.

  The Order is sceptical, as their spirit is broken. Everyone is different to how Harry remembers. Remus and Tonks, for example, cannot bear to look at each other: Tonks is their mole within Voldemort's ranks, impersonating Narcissa Malfoy, whom the Order assassinated years ago. Remus can't stand that she is sleeping with Lucius Malfoy as part of her cover.

  But eventually the Order relents. They assault the Ministry and make it to the DoM at the cost of many lives. Harry uses the time machine, goes back in time and prevents his own assassination.

  And is stuck in the past. The alternate dystopian timeline is now but a figment of Harry's memories. It has corrected itself out of existence.

  Epilogue: Harry, still in the past, goes to meet Albus Dumbledore. He confesses everything. Dumbledore explains how it is that Harry survived the change in the timeline: Harry's blood in Voldemort's veins. Voldemort being alive once more meant Harry could not die. This combined with Harry being under his invisibility cloak at the time of the change resulted in Harry both surviving the change but also not being displaced by it.

  Harry confesses he has no idea what to do now. He misses his kids.

  Dumbledore asks him some probing questions. He was able to walk into an Acromantula nest at the age of 12 and survive? He was able to take a portkey out of the graveyard, though Voldemort would not have planned for the portkey to be two-way? He broke into the Department of Mysteries aged 15 without any trouble? He was able to evade Voldemort's Ministry for months at the age of 17?

  Harry understands. Like his experience with time turners, this was always meant to be. His presence in the past was already factored into the future. Harry would protect his younger self, guiding him from the shadows, unaware that he ever existed. He would return to the future the long way around. He will see his children again, on the day that his younger self disappears into the past.
