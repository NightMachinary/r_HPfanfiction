This is a very unpolished premise but this is the general idea: during the final battle Harry as he kills Voldemort is somehow transported like 15 yrs into the future. He now has to deal with the fact that everyone has moved on, and that he was thought to be dead.

etc. etc. He attends his last year if Hogwarts and blah blah plot.

(obviously all Weasley next gen kids exist except James Lily and Albus)
