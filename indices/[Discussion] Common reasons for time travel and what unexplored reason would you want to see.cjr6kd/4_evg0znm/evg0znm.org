What we don't have is a full on Crime Syndicate (Crisis on Two Earths) plot: Where another dimension contacts the main one for help. Bonus if the other dimension has flipped roles (so Harry is evil and Voldemort is good).

Yes I know we have that one where it does flipped roles, but that one involves a magical accident, not "Heroes, We need your help, please come save our world".

There have been a couple "Justice Lords" storyline, where an evil/grey Harry somehow enters the universe of canon harry and proceeds to mess things up. It doesn't work anywhere near as well as it did in Justice League :(.

You know what is missing from most time travel story? Loss. Seriously, 99% of the stories have a happily ever after with nothing bittersweet. Even the ones that do "I'm going to delay the pairing till everyone grows up" still has everyone pair off. There should be more "By going back in time, i've lost the love of my life forever. (S)He is right there, but with all my extra experience it would never be the same.

Or you know, just swapping pairings without it being part of what is being fixed. 99% of them are either "The world was horrible, including the love life of the characters, so time travel fixes that" or "Somehow everyone ends up with the same happy people they had in the previous timeline". It is ok to have a character be in a good, happy relationship in one timeline and then after you mess with time, have them end with someone else, and still be in a good, happy relationship.

'course, I'd imagine that would mess with some people's OTP ideas...

(This applies to non-pairings as well, but it is most obvious with pairings)
