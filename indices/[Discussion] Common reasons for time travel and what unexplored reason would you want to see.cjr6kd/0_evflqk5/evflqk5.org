Most common variations fall into one of three categories:

1. Screwed-up future where everything went to hell and a hand-basket, so someone engineers an attempted do-over via magic or such (NoFP is the epitome of this).
2. Canon divergence at some point where something sends the character back due to early death (ex. graveyard, DoM via Veil, etc.).
3. Accidentally messing with some artifact or such that throws the protagonist back in time some arbitrary (but usually convenient) time period (ex. Oh God Not Again!)

Arguably, I would say the best fics tend to be either one's that take the concept completely seriously (not horsing around) or not seriously at all (whether as comedy or pure!crack, this is generally a winning formula). Fics that play the middle ground or are just power-wank tend to be pretty interchangeable (the sole exception to this may be Dodging Prisons and Stealing Witches, but that is due to quality of writing and originality overall).

Now, what I would like to see is particularly original (mostly ideas). Here are some that I can say I love:

1. *Outside time-traveler perspectives*. What I mean are fics like linkffn(Realignment) and linkffn(Anticlockwise by Casscade). Showing what its like to see a time-traveler come out of nowhere and flip the tables. Not only that, how does one deal with that outsider perspective?
2. *Time-travelers from the past coming forward* to stop Voldemort when he rises again. This is a difficult premise to make work admittedly, but offers a very different way for things to play out (i.e. travelers have no idea what to work with other than knowledge of previous war or individuals).
3. There is a certain formula that goes like this: person (usually Harry) dies in the future beyond hope or whatever, wakes up to find himself confronted by diety/entity/magic/death/etc., said being wants to send them back to fix the screw-up (often because they don't like Voldemort's horcrux idea), often with special advantages. Again, see DP&SW for example. But why is it always assumed the entity is a force for good? Time-travel inherently wrecks the nature of reality (even in canon - see HP wiki on D. of Mysteries). *What happens if the entity is in it to screw with reality, to see what chaos they can bring* (set up Ahriman or Eris for example). Now that is a fun idea. Unfortunately, the only fic that even approaches this idea is linkffn(The Lesser Sadness), which is an absolute gem despite its brevity (seriously read this one).
4. *Time-travelers make things worse*. So maybe they come back, and there interference leads to not dealing with the blood purity/classicism issues in Britain, or even allowing for the rise of other dark wizards. Or even just dealing with the aftermath (realistically) of time-traveling to the past and how the world (or even the Ministry) would react to that eventually.
