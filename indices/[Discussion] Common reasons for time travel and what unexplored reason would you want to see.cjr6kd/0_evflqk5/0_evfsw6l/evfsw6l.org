Your first idea reminded me of linkffn(Many Thanks by Madm05)

I really like your other ideas as well, though I'm not sure how the second suggestion would even occur in the first place unless by accident or some sort of Seeing ability. The lack of knowledge somewhat reminds me of linkffn(The Second String) where Harry travels back in time the summer before 5th year and therefore knows nothing about horcruxes, etc. and almost nothing about the first war, which is also a different perspective than usual and potentially interesting to explore.

I especially like the fourth point you suggested, but I'm sure there would never be very many of those because a lot of people (not everyone, but a lot) see the fun of time travel as being able to make everyone happy and that fic would be soooo dark. The knowledge that your actions directly caused the world to be demonstrably worse would be soul-crushing.

Having written that, I am reminded of linkao3(Abyssus Abyssum Invocat by ladysunflower) where that is essentially what happens.
