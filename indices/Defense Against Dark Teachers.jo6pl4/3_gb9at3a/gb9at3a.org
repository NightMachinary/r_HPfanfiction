Turns out that this was Voldemort's end goal all along, he never actually wanted to rule, he just wanted to have the children that came into their would to be as skilled as possible in DADA and since he wasn't able to do it as a teacher he instead choose to make the environment so hostile that the students have no choice but to become masters in DADA, Dark Arts and murdering.
