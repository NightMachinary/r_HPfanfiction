[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11252584/1/The-Mark][/The Mark/]] by Nargled might not be exactly what you're looking for, but it does focus on the trials following the second war, as well as the corruption that would likely still be present in the Wizarding World. It's a relatively short, two-chapter story. It's also Harry/Hermione, if that makes a difference for you.
