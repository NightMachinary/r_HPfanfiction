At the start of OotP, Fudge was using every means at his disposal to attack Harry and Dumbledore. I'm pretty sure he abused his power when he forced the whole Wizengamot to gather for something as simple as a minor using magic, and he played dirty when he changed the date and place of the Trial without warning Harry and Dumbledore.

Harry being considered "of age" may erase the accusations that he used Magic as a Minor, but he would still be accused of Breaking the Statute of Secrecy by using Magic in front of a Muggle. And Fudge would probably used the fact that he is "legally" an adult to give him a harsher sentence, like a stay in Azkaban.

Also, it's a detail that can be ignored for this prompt, but in canon, Harry didn't become "of Age" when he was entered in the Tournament. The "Age Line" was only put by Dumbledore (with the agreement of the other organizers) as a precaution to reduce the risk of deaths during the Tournament, but it is not directly linked (both magically and legally) to the Tournament itself. Like, Harry (or any other minor) should not have been able to enter his name in the Goblet, but once it's entered, the Goblet doesn't care about the Age of the candidate, only its abilities.
