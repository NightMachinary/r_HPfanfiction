Dudley is "only" a cousin to Harry, it is not impossible that, when the Statute was passed, only the parents and siblings were considered as family. But that's not the point.

Fudge want to put Harry in trouble, and is more than willing to be dishonest to do so, and ignore any element that does not fit his narrative. I mean, in canon, when he saw that the jury was going to declare Harry innocent, his first reflex had been to try to attack Harry on his accidental magic back in PoA, even though he was the one who cleared Harry of all charges at that time. And let's not talk about Umbridge, who was the first to call Harry a liar when he talked about Dementors, even though she was the one who sent them against him.
