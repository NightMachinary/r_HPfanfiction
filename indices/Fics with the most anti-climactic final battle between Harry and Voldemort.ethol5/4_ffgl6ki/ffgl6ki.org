Linkffn(Light's Hope, Death's Hunters)

I really liked this fic but the ending is just... so disappointing.

Harry and Hermione leave Britain for a few years and become Bounty Hunters to help them prepare for facing Voldemort. When they finally return and actually fight him, they basically blow up his entire mansion with explosives then cut his head off with a Diffindo. No real battle, no Horcruxes (which I'm fine with but you should still make him hard to kill and provide an explaination as to why he's alive), not even using a deadly curse.
