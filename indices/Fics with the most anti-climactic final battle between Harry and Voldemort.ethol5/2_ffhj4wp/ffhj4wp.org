In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8937860/1/Hiding-in-Plain-Sight][Hiding In Plain Sight]], Harry's victory is so anticlimactic that it doesn't even happen on-screen! Apparently, Voldie managed to Summon Harry's glasses and since he's blind-without-em, Harry's attempt to accio his glasses back actually latched onto the wall behind Voldie, flattening the Dark Lord under a pile of bricks. Harry, trying to find his glasses, subsequently accidentally stomps on Voldie's throat, killing him.

The main part of the story revolves around Harry having had Lasik to remove his glasses-induced-weakness and discovering an odd thing... without his glasses, pure-blood wizards (and those raised in the Magical World) can't recognize him! Cue shenanigans including Mad-Eye Moody enrolling as a First-year at Hogwarts...
