There was one where Snape did it. He put some poisonous gas vial below his knee. He took the barely acceptable (it stopped it from killing him, but he still had a load of side effects to deal with) went up to voldy, dropped to his knees (breaking the vials), and then dragged Voldy AND Pettigrew into the floo to the ministry. I think there was a bounty (and a pardon), Snape took this and GTFO'd the country.
