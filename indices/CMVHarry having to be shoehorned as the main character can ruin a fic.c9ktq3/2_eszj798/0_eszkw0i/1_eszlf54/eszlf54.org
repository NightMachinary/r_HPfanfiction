Amen. I hate the perfunctory ones, where they have no chemistry, and it's just 'male and female spend time together, so obviously they're gonna fall in love.' And he's the main character, while she's the most prominent female character, so /obviously/ it's going to be Harry/Hermione.

Like, if it's actually well-written, I'm all for it, but it's the default for garbage writers, so it has to deal with that stigma.
