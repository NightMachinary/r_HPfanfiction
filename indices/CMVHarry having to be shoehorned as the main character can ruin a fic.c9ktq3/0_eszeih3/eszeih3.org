See, I think if you are shoehorning in practically /any/ character, then the fic is likely ruined regardless of who it may be. If the author operates from "this person must be the lead," then they have likely sacrificed the plot for a particular character to serve as their SI or avatar in the story. Ditto for Hermione as well.
