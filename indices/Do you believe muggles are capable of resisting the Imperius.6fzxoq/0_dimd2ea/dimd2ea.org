Canon seems to work from the assumption that resistance to the Imperius is purely defined by willpower. Barty Crouch Jr., while acting as Mad-Eye Moody, said:

  The Imperius Curse can be fought ... but it takes real strength of character.

It does seem to be exceedingly rare to be able to fight the compulsion, however, as none of Harry's classmates managed to do so, not to mention the huge number of adult witches and wizards that have fallen prey to the curse. If I recall correctly, the only other person to have successfully thrown off the Imperius Curse was Barty Crouch Jr. himself.

I wouldn't discount the possibility of magical ability coming into play, however, given that those who have been known to resist it are powerful in their own right. Harry could cast the Patronus at 13, while Crouch overpowered Mad-Eye Moody, a well-known and very paranoid Auror, with only the help of a heavily weakened Dark Lord or Wormtail, if they even did help. Not to mention Confounding the Goblet of Fire, which apparently also required powerful magic.

Or perhaps it is less that magically powerful wizards/witches are able to resist the Imperius Curse, but that wizards/witches with strength of character and willpower tend to be more powerful?

Anyway, I've kind of addressed both sides without really coming to my own conclusion.

So, tl;dr, I don't know if resistance to the Imperius Curse is based on willpower or magical strength, but canon seems to imply that it's based on the former, and personally, I prefer that version, too.
