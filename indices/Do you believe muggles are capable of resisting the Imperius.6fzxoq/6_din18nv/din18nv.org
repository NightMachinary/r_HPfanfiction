I read this and I keep forgetting my answer should be strictly based off of canon, but otherwise I'm thinking that if the Muggle in question was from the Assassin's Creed universe then they /could/ be unaffected if they had First Civilization genes- meaning if the Apple of Eden can't effect them, neither should the Imperius Curse.
