My headcanon is that resistance to the Imperius is linked to the ability to have, as Terry Pratchett called them, "Second Thoughts" - having a running track of thoughts about your thoughts. Basically, some degree of mindfullness. HP has it likely either due to the scarcrux, or it grew as a result of needing to self-censor his speech and body-language to survive the Dursleys for his entire life.

I can do that myself. The mindfulness. I've had that for almost as long as I can remember.
