I'd say that only a wizard could throw off the spell by resisting it, but a muggle might be able to resist succumbing to the effects, if they have a strong personality and have experience in resisting pleasure.

The spell enforces its commands by flooding the mind with a feeling of euphoria, so you might only see muggles who are used to functioning while heavily medicated or very drunk able to act differently than commanded. Best bets would be trained monks, religious fanatics, and the occasional warlord.
