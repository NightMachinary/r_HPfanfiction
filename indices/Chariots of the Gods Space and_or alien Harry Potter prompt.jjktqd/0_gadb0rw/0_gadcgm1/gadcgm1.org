That looks absolutely perfect. But yes, introducing the Aliens is another step one can take. It makes it complicated for sure, and you'd have to decide if they will be a variation of what Erich Von Daniken speaks of, or if it will be the prelude to a sifi crossover; Stargate, star trek, star wars, aliens and the predators and so on.

But if it's not going to be the clich√©d crossover, it's probably going to be an original take on the Annunaki and insert them. Maybe wizards and witches are the offsprings of the Nephalim? The giants who are the halbred children of humans and aliens.

Or they are offsprings of the survivors from Atlantis and Lemuria, who are also rumored to be of extraterrestrial origins. Maybe the magical survivors hid beneath powerful wards to hide them from their alien ancestors?
