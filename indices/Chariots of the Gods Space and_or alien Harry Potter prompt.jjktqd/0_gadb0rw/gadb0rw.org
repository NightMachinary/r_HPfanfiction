This would actually be reasonably straightforward, at least as far as presenting a believable perspective from Harry.

1) Magicals are the result of genetic alterations, either through tinkering with human genome or simply being the children of the children of children of the 'gods'.

2) The various deities and respected powers = all 'gods'. Probably Merlin was a direct child of one of the 'gods'.

3) Broomsticks are just a very basic degenerate 'chariot/vimana'. This gives him a reason to love flying and competing in Quidditch.

4) Runes = language of the 'gods'? Like how some Christians think of 'anglic script'.

5) Voldemort...went crazy since he was hateful of those who shared magical ancestry (muggleborn)? A lesson to him and all 'purebloods' to respect the magical ancestry of the 'gods' wherever it shows up.

6) Other magical creatures/beings...maybe transplants from the homes of the 'gods' which prospered into breeding populations?

Mostly, if you just present it as Harry interpreting everything from this perspective then not much needs to change. It only gets complicated if you want his perspective to actually be real and maybe have the aliens show up, or something else tangible to happen that can only happen if the book is right.
