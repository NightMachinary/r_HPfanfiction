How is an apartment harder to suspend disbelief for than a single large space? Take your single large space and put up some studwork-and-plasterboard partitions, magical plumbing where necessary, add furniture and voila! Apartment in your trunk.

Or have a big landscape like Mr. Scamander's, and build a house on it. Once you're creating space with an arbitrarily-portable portal object, you're limited by the skill of the enchanter you hire to build it and your budget as to what you put inside.

In the original seven books, internal spaces seemed to be limited to tents, bags of holding and that one trunk of Moody's; I just sort of assumed that there were other uses of the technique happening all over the place off-stage, because it's so /enormously/ useful. One assumes it's limited by the working hours of wizards skilled enough to make such things, but other than that it'd be like the wizarding world's version of microchips, they'd use it in /everything/.
