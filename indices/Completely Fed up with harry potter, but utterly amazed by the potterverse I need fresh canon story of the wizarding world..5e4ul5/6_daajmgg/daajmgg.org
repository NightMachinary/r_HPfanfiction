Not sure if this counts, but there is a 3 part continuation following James Potter (Harry's eldest son, not his dad), which seems to somewhat step away from Harry himself

[[http://www.jamespotterseries.com/muggle_index.html]]

There is also the Albus Potter series by NoahPhantom on ff.net. linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation)

They're both a tad slow, and neither one holds a candle to the AQ series IMO, but they are OC's who have their own stories and don't bother visiting the HP stations of canon
