Okay, so the trick from here is that there are few fanfics that focus on original characters that are a) well written, b) at all interesting, c) not set at Hogwarts or Wizarding Britain in general, and the biggest bane of fanfiction, d) finished. You'll want to look for 'OC' tags, and pay attention to the summaries.

I don't have any specific suggestions for your beyond AQ, but I wish you luck.
