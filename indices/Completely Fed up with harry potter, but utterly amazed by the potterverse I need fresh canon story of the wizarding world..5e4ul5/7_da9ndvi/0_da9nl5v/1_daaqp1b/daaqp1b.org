Not exactly what you're after, but a lot of very AU stories are effectively exploring a new world (that happens to be called Britain, with a new school that happens to be called Hogwarts and a new wizard that happens to be called Harry Potter etc.)

linkffn(Wit of the Raven) is a good example of what I mean, and although it's a bit further from canon it could still conceivably be a foreign magical tradition, or something along those lines.
