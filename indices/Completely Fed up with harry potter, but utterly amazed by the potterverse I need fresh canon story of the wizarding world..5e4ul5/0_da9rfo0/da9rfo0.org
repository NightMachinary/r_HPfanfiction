A bit further afield:

linkffn(4508571) aka Für Das Größere Wohl by Pseudonym Sam

and

linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh) - not canon, in that instead of Harry we have Jasmine, who gets sent back thousands of years and has to trudge her way back to the present. Try it out- it's most fun for the sections about times in the distant past. You'll love it and then curse my name for suggesting it, as it's still in-process and infrequently updated.
