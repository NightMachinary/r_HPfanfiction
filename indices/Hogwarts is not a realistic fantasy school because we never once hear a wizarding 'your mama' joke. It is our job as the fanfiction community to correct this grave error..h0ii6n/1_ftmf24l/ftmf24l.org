Yo Mama so ugly she was named Senior Undersecretary to the Minister.

Yo Mama so hideous that Lupin wouldn't let anyone risk facing her as a Boggart.

Yo Mama so hideous that Fred and George tried shipping her with Filch.

Yo Mama so Fat that the Ministry thought Harry had blown up another Muggle.

Yo Mama so fat that they called in the Unspeakables when Saint Mungos couldn't remove the "Engorgio gone wrong"
