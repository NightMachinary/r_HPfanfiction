I think there's a cultural gap here.

The Wizarding World at large seems to value family pretty highly, plus the "your mum" joke is not as much of a phenomenon in Britain to begin with, so I think a "your mum" joke would fall /seriously/ flat in a British Wizarding school.

That said...

"Your mum's so ugly, when she went to the dungeons Professor Quirrell freaked out about another troll"\\
"Your mum's so stupid, she failed Muggle Studies. You're Muggleborn, right?"\\
"Your mum's such a duffer she got sorted into House Elf"\\
"The Black Lake used to be a lot bigger, but then your mum decided to cannonball into it."
