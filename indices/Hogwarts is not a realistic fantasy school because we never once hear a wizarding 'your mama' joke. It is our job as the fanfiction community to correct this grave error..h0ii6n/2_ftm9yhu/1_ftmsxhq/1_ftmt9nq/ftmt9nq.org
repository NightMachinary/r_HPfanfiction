I agree. I'm not american and there are certain hazing/pranks that are very specific to my country also. Stephen Fry's biography was very elucidating on boarding school life in a bygone UK era, a wee bit before the marauders time I believe, but very interesting to learn about. The things they got up to would certainly not make it into a children's series!
