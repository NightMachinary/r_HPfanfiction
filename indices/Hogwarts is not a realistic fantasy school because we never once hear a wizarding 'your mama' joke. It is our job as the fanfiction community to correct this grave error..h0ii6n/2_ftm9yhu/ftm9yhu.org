Not to mention all other toilet humour. And pranks like flushing peoples heads, hiding their things, moving their beds to the hallway in the middle of the night through their sleeping - boarding school life is kind of Lord of the Flies.

I know it wasn't up to JK Rowling to make boarding school realistic but can you IMAGINE the shit that would go down with a bunch of boarding school munters with actual magic at their fingertips?? Fred and George were vanilla. Gorgeous, lovely creatures. Balm for my soul. And totally vanilla.
