There's 7 years and 2 groups per year (classes are usually two houses paired together) so 14 groups of students. There's only 13 teachers. So teachers have to have a higher workload than students just in classes, plus correcting lots of homework essays and tests. And that's ignoring that electives are probably taught in smaller groups, so even more teacher workload. A secondary school where I went to had about 60 teachers for about 100 students per year and 8 years. Hogwarts has at least 40 students per year for 7 years, so they should have 21 teachers for a similar workload distribution. Hogwarts should have at least two teachers per primary subject and one per elective.
