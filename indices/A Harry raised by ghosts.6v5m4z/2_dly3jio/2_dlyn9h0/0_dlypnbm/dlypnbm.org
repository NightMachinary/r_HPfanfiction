It's been a while, but... Little Harry transforms into a raven with accidental magic, and ends up with the ravens kept in the Tower of London, being raised by the ghosts of various notables who were executed there. He does eventually stop being a raven, and goes to Hogwarts iirc. It's a little dated now as it's very much an indy Harry, muggle armed forces fic, but it's still quite fun.
