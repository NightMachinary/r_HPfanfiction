Not gonna start it tonight but it looks good. More seriously, going without reading fanfic for 6 months is no big deal. There's plenty of other stuff to read. I was into fanfic some years ago, then didn't read any at all for years, and more recently have gotten back into it. But I should probably stop soon since it's such a time sink.
