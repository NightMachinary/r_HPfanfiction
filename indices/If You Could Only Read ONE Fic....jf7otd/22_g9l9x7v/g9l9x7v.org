How is it possible to only read one fanfic?

But, if, theoretically speaking, I was to only read one (that you've not already listed here), it would be [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] by Seselt - Hermione in this story is totally badass and so smart. It is complete and has a sequel.
