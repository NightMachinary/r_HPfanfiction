  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  Most of you remember the day that Severus Snape went to Voldemort, begging for the lives of the Potters. What if Voldemort had actually considered this and decided that Harry could be useful to him? How would the Wizarding World react to Harry Potter after he was raised by a Dark Lord? Dark!Harry. Annoying!Dumbledore. Rated T just in case. Now complete!
