My favorite fic in the fandom and the one I recommend the most is [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The Secret Language of Plants]]. I recommend it so frequently that I keep it up on my phone's browser at all times. I have read and reread everything by this author, but TSLoP is my favorite because the magic system is unique, the characters are well-rounded and feel more real, and the writing style is, imo, beautiful. 10/10 recommend
