If I could recommend only one fic: "Fate is a Four Letter word" by Philo.

But for reading I would be hard-pressed to choose between "Fate" and one of the other longer fics mentioned here, especially the "Like None Other" series by Aspeninthesunlight.

I have already read "Fate" several times over the last few months. So while I love it and wouldn't mind having it the only fic I could read, I know most of it by heart by now, making it a bit boring.

"Like None Other" is something that I have been wanting to read again and catch up with the last posted chapters. Last time I read the whole thing, the second part was half-finished. But it is so long that I tend to get bored with it halfway through the first part. If I had nothing else to read I would probably be able to stick with it this time.
