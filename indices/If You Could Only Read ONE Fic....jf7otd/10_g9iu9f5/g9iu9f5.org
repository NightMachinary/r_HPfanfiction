I have to say 'Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion' by DriftWood1965. It's a straight-up crackfic with enough laughs to make it incredibly re-readable, some funny bashing that's so over the top you can't get made at it or take it seriously enough to get mad... and it has a running fart joke that makes the one in 'Blazing Saddles' look like it was done by a second-grader. One thing's for certain: I will never look at a giant egg the same again, and oh, now I understand why she's known in some corners as 'Hermione "NO PRISONERS-!" Granger'. ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚
