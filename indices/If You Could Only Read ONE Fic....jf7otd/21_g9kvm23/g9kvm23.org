For me, it would have to be "My Immortal" by Tara Gilesbie. It's the only 'work' that made me cringe enough to put down every paragraph or so. Since I usually go through stories at a really monstrous pace (when I first got to read OotP, I finished the thing in 20 min, then aced a quiz), so it's the only way for a fic to last me more than a few hours. Ouch.
