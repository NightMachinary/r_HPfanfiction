How an Obscurial works is you have to deliberately /suppress/ your magic, or be forced to an extreme to do so.

I doubt an Obscurial would come from just not going to Hogwarts or some other magic school, there'd be /way/ more danger of Muggleborn witches/wizards turning into one.

Justin Finch-Fletchley could have been an example of that - his name was down for Eton, one of the most prestigious schools in Muggle Britain. I doubt that him just saying "You know what, I'll take Eton over some unknown school in Scotland" would have made an Obscurial, though him being forced to keep the Statute of Secrecy in that situation might have.

If the child was never /found/ (and thus, not really pressured by having to keep the Statute), I think accidental magic would just sort of keep happening to the same degree until the child figured it out on their own. Canonically your magic doesn't really "grow", you just get smarter and learn how to use it better.
