I think this was explained by JK in her Quill of Acceptance and Book of Admission entry on Pottermore, with the quill recording every instance of magic done for the first time by anyone and the book only allowing it to write the names of those that do it repeatedly. Also it seems that the wizards do have a way of finding you considering that Hagrid managed to track Harry down even on an island in the middle of the ocean. However probably if a kid absolutely refuses to go to Hogwarts then all the magic build up will turn them in an Obscurial in situations where they lose control according to the Fantastic Beasts canon. Therefore in the spirit of the Statute of Secrecy, probably it is in everyone's best interest that that kid would be taken away to Hogwarts.
