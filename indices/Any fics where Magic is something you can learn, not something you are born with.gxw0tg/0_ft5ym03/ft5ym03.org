Haven't seen any that I can recommend but I could totally see something similar to the Wheel of Time system. Where some people are born with a natural ability to use magic and have to learn control or will continually have accidental magic, while others are born with the ability to learn. They won't have accidental magic and are harder to find, but if found they can learn just as well as a natural born wizard.

I did have an idea once for a crossover with The Magicians, where natural born witches and wizards were picked up by Hogwarts and the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, which didn't care about the ones who just had the talent (in universe they'd be even lower than muggleborn probably, why go through the effort to teach them if they didn't even show any accidental magic) While the ones who had the ability to learn were picked up later by Brakebills and other magical schools of the books.
