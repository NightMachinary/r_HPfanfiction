And later on in the book (with the help of Felix Felicis, of course) Harry pulls on all the right strings to get Slughorn to give him the real memory of when he and Riddle discussed horcruxes.

That could actually be an interesting jumping-off point; Dumbledore did give him that assignment on purpose in canon. You could frame it all as Dumbledore belatedly trying to teach him that the fight ahead won't all be a headlong rush to sling Expelliarmus around; he thought he'd be there to do what needed to be done behind the scenes for Harry, but now he's faced with death in less than a year.
