I wouldnt necessarily say its harry manipulating people with Dumbledore because dumbledore is kinda like a grandfather/father figure in this fic but harry is aware of dumbledores plans and when it's the goblet of fire he automatically assumes that dumbledore put his name in so that he could get close to the action??
