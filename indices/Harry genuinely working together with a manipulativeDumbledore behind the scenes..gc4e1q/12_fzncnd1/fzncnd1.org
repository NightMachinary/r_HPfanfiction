You'd like ‘Fate'. It's a Ron Weasley centric story where he, Albus and snake get along like an old wives group that kind of hate each other.

Ron also gets fucking shafted at every opportunity in what I can only describe as ‘untold amounts of mental, physical and emotional torture'. Damn good story though
