In my headcannon both spells and potions are simplified symphatic magic rituals. Ingredients in potions are equal to incantations in spells, spells tell magic what to do with words while potions attempt to show magic what to do by using ingredients as a sort of hieroglyphic writing system. for example plants with healing properities like dittany make a healing potion while things like sphinx tongue make veritaserum.

Enviromental factors such as full moons equal to wand movements since wand movements in my headcannon are derived from movements of astronomical objects and signify influence celestial bodies have on smaller scale objects like in horoscopes.

Solvent usually signifies the intent. Simpler potions have little intent input and use clear water as some sort of tabula rasa. Darker poisons usually use blood of murdered animals such as unicorns to signify death and destruction. Healing potions use things that were historically believed to have healing properities such as sea water or honey.

edit: They put it on fire because Fire is believed by many ancient philosphers to have purifying and reshaping values, and in the zoroastrian religion is a sacred thing that brings the essence of burned things to surface. Fun fact, Zoroastrians of persia were caled Magi by arab conquerors.
