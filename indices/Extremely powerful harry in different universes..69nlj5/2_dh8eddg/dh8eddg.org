linkffn(Potter's Protector)

This is painful on mobile lol. Harry Potter becomes very powerful, well more like he learns to use the power that is there. If told he Can do something he basically can do it if he believes it. Might need to know just a bit about the Buffy Universe considering Xander and Joyce are two major characters but they do explain quite a bit.

I mention this one because the follow up stories take place in various other universes include superhero (mostly xmen) smallville and eventually Buffy.
