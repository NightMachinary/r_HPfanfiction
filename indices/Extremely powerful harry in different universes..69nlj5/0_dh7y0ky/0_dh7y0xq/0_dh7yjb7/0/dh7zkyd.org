Harry is accidentally taken out of time at the end of the final battle only to be put back some odd hundred years later on the quarian home world while it's overrun by non-heratic Geth. They ask him to be their Emmisary to the other organic races because they want to integrate into galactic civilization.

It loosely follows the entire mass effect plot line while following Harry as he goes around and does stuff.

I was worried because of the description the author gave about harry just deciding to have fun but it's a fantastic story and way more than a random crack fic. It has a satisfying ending to top everything else off as well.
