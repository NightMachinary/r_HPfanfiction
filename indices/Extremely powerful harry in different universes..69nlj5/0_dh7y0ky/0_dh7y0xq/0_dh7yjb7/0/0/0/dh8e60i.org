I remember looking up a few things about mass effect mostly because I wanted to see how certain things looked, it explains what's going on pretty well as the story goes.

I actually surprised one of my friends with a summary of what must have happened in mass effect a few weeks ago based just on what I had learned from the fanfic, because he knew I hadn't played any of the games.
