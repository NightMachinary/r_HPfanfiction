If you enjoyed "In Somno Veritas" and ObsidianPen's works then you will probably like "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7502151/chapters/17052891][No Glory]]". It has similar dynamics of the soul-link but with the saner Tom Riddle/Voldemort of ObsidianPen's other stories. linkao3(7502151)

For time-travel fics I'd recommend "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12541396/1/you-belong-to-me-i-belong-to-you][you belong to me (i belong to you)]]". It's in progress and still relatively short at the moment. However, the scenes of interaction between Harry and Tom Riddle are fascinating so far. linkffn(12541396)
