off the top of my head, some tomarry's (as opposed to harrymort):

linkffn(A Dangerous Game) - Diary!Tom/5th year harry

linkffn(Tainted by R.L. Peverell) Similar to Kiss or Kill - young tom goes to school in harry's era post DH

linkffn(The Portrait) Post DH. young adult Tom in Harry's era talks to him through portrait

linkffn(Bonded one) typical harry time travels to tom's era. Long.

MayMarlow's Don't Fuck with the Florists - Harry in Tom's era around the time Tom works in Borgin and Burke's

​

But you should def read linkffn(Teaching History is Old News) if you haven't already. Cold Tom. Both of them are adults. Cross generations AU. The interactions are really amusing. Harry's character is a little OOC, borderlining on Luna Lovegood personality, and Tom's exasperated.

​

Oh, and since I've sort of taken your prompt as a challenge to think of Tomarry's that don't involve time travel but keep Tom's personality similar to his younger self, there's also:

linkffn(Jewel amongst the stones)

linkao3(Consuming Shadows)

.... and yeah.. i could keep going but I gotta cut myself off somewhere....
