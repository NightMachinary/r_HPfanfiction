I forgot the fic, but Harry used portkeys. First, he took out a slingshot. Next, he shot a portkey-rock into a pile of dragon crap which portkeyed on top of Draco. Then, he shot the golden egg and left.

Then this one here is my favorite of all. Triwizard Tales, linkffn(7594305)

He bribes his way through the tournament. Dragons? Here, have some gold, cattle and booze. Merpeople? Here, a pallet of peanut butter. Forgot what he did for the maze though. Crack.
