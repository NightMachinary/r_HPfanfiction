  Is the book version any different from the movie version?
#+end_quote

Very different. In the books, the dragon is protecting her own eggs as well as the golden egg, it is not waiting next to the entrance for Harry, there's no chase through the grounds and the dragon is neither dead not injured. Harry's broom is not damaged. And the moment the dragon abandons the nest to chase Harry, Harry dodges her and grabs the egg. He does suffer a shallow gash from a tail spike across his back initially but he's the fastest among the four champions to complete the task.

  if a little dangerous in execution as he's flying away from a fire breathing dragon on a wooden broom.

I think not. The enchanted broomstick is not likely to be any more flammable than Harry himself. Any lick of dragon flame that comes close enough to burn the broom is going to give Harry second degree burns at least, which is /less likely/ to happen on a fast broom.

  I just think it could have been done a different way. More magic, more charms or spells or transfiguration or DADA.

I agree. It's what I meant about the secondary plan; something to distract, draw away or incapacitate the dragon if using himself as bait (risky!!) fails. But in the books, Harry barely managed to learn the summoning charm (to get his broom) in time for the Task.

This is something to explore in time travel stories, where a more skilled Harry from the future is attempting the Task. But usually it also involves the author dissing the canon attempt.

  Just disappointed in the movie I guess. Which I'm basing my reply off of.

I completely agree. But that's movie's pandering to the Rule of Cool.
