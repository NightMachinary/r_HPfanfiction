I'll admit. Haven't read the book in more than a few years. Is the book version any different from the movie version?

I just think that in a competition that emphasizes creativity in solving tasks with magic and having the proper skill to use that magic; that using a broom is kinda......i don't want to say unimaginative.... but that's what I'll go with.

Now that's not to say I don't agree with the points you brought up. Tactically speaking, very good plan, if a little dangerous in execution as he's flying away from a fire breathing dragon on a wooden broom. Admittedly Harry is an amazing flier, and I don't believe in any scenario where he'd lose to a big, slow, and less maneuverable oppenent like a dragon. Harry (on broom) vs Dragon = Harry win.

I just think it could have been done a different way. More magic, more charms or spells or transfiguration or DADA.

Just disappointed in the movie I guess. Which I'm basing my reply off of.

Edit: Just had my brain fart wafted in front of my face (thank you kind sir). BROOMS ARE ENCHANTED!! How the bloody heckling heck did I forget that. Thanks to ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ this guy for reminding me that broom makers probably thought of enchanting the brooms against fire.
