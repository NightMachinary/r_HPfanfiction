I think with the exception of Fleur, Harry's plan was the best among the four champions.

Harry is prodigiously skilled on a broomstick and flying as he does, he gets an extreme advantage in both speed and maneuverability. That would be true for any skilled flier. He kept himself at a safe distance while still seeming threatening to the mother dragon and eventually annoyed her enough to draw her away from the nest, and then used his superior speed to get around her and grab the egg.

It was a simple but effective plan and is reflective of his skills as a fourth year student. The biggest drawback was that he had no secondary plan if the dragon had decided to hunker down on her nest.
