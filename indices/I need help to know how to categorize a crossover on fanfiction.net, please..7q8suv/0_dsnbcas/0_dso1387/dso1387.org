But what if I put things like that Japanese magic school that was mentioned in pottemore?

In fact I'm epsanndo on something like the movie "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" (which basically only has two characters indirectly related to the original story). So I think I could just use a character mentioned in the pottemore who lived in the 16th century.

But like I said, there's going to be a lot of people reading it being a crossover and how the characters are based on historical figures, so I'm going to pose as a normal harry potter story. Thanks for listening.
