I feel like it's going to be a pretty hard struggle for you to write a story like this, and have it be interesting. Firstly, you have the problem that it's a Quidditch Story. Lots of people have tried to write them, but the problem is that Quidditch itself tends to be boring (though it's a split between the sport itself being boring, and authors not being very good at writing it), and then when you add in background stuff like draft picks, or scoring percentages... it gets really wordy. Like, JKR writing Quidditch scenes was okay, and I haven't really seen any stories that do it better than that.

So, you're already starting at a disadvantage, then you add in an OC. That's even more of a disadvantage, because why should a reader care about an OC? And readers can see through thin attempts to try and connect the story to canon by having known characters show up occasionally.

I think you got your work cut out for you.
