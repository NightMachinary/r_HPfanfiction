  Like, JKR writing Quidditch scenes was okay, and I haven't really seen any stories that do it better than that.

And even she most often used Quidditch for story:

Year 1:

- Cursed Broom,
- Normal match, but Snape refereeing. Very short. (No on-screen Quidditch /at all/ - focus on Malfoy taunting Neville / Ron / Hermione)
- (Harry in hospital wing)

Year 2:

- Bludger
- (called off because attacks)
- (called off because attacks)

Year 3:

- Dementors
- Malfoy pretends to be dementor, Harry casts patronus, catches snitch.
- Normal, albeit rough match

Year 4:(GoF, no quidditch)

Year 5:

- Normal match, but Harry/Fred/George attack Malfoy, get banned 'for life'.
- (banned from quidditch)
- (banned from quidditch)

Year 6:

- Normal match, 1st as captain,
- Normal match, Harry gets knocked out by bludger - very short.
- (in detention)

Like we have seen five 'normal' matches in total, and each one of those had a special twist to it as well - one of them had no Quidditch at all. The other ten possible matches that could have been played either had their highlight outside of the pitch or Harry did not play at all.

I don't know how good of a writer you are, but it seems very hard to do a Quidditch-Fic well. I have seen a few that /try/, but most wen't good, and I tended to skip over the matches.

If you do it, prepare to have a lot of stuff going on outside of the matches, because the matches won't carry the fic, I think.
