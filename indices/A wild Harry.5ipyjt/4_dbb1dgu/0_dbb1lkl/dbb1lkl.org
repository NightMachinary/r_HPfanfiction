I love the evolution of this fic. It started out as standard, tropey, if slightly humorous "Harry grows up slightly different" AU and then over time just turned into a madhouse.

I still like it but i hope it's not going to be too over the top in an attempt to be funny. I thought it was quite hilarious before the author decided that Harry needed to have the ridiculous Quidditch game in the last chapter.

His few interactions with Daphne are so ridiculously adorable and funny. I want more of that and less of the over the top "hilarious luck Harry".
