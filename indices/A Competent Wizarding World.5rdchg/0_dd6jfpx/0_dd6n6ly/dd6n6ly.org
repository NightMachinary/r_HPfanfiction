  That said, I've thought a bit about how to have a competent wizarding world, and the answer would essentially be to have the various magical races as equals, being represented in an elective Wizengamot.

  Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry would instead be Hogwarts School of Spellcraft (again, with all kinds of races), wizard prison would be about rehabilitation rather than rule-through-fear...you could still have the pureblood supremacist movement, but they wouldn't be entrenched in the government.

Competent does not mean progressive.
