Eeh...you can't really have a competent wizarding world. The place has to be stupid and corrupt so that Harry can end up taking on Voldemort himself again and again, create and justify plot twists, et-cetera.

You'll notice that in every book, Albus Dumbledore is somehow out of Harry's reach during the climax; a ministry summons, being removed as Headmaster, can't stand in the way of the Ministry (so he advises Hermione & Harry on how to do it instead), Harry is portkeyed away...and in the 5th book, Dumbledore's appearance is what puts an end to that book's Voldemort fight. Again, this is precisely for the sake of the plot; it needs to be Harry who fights Voldemort, not Dumbledore.

Similarly, the Ministry of Magic is rife with pureblood supremacism and stuffed with Voldemort's followers, because otherwise they'd be too effective in fighting the latter. Which would mean, once again, that the spotlight is taken off Harry.

That said, I've thought a bit about how to have a competent wizarding world, and the answer would essentially be to have the various magical races as equals, being represented in an elective Wizengamot.

Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry would instead be Hogwarts School of Spellcraft (again, with all kinds of races), wizard prison would be about rehabilitation rather than rule-through-fear...you could still have the pureblood supremacist movement, but they wouldn't be entrenched in the government.

And...hmm...how would Voldemort rise under such circumstances? Maybe other young-adult fiction and maybe real-life events relating to attempted coups by a minority movement might be worth looking at.
