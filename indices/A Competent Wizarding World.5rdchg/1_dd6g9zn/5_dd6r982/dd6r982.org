Can you imagine trying to hold wizards in prison without Dementors?

I made this point not even 20 min ago in another post so I'll quote myself:

  Wandless magic exists, from Snape and Quirrel cursing Harry's broom to Grindewald in FB. Every wizard can teleport, some can change into animals, some can fly and others can change their looks. Hagrid is a half giant with enough strength and magic resistance to escape from multiple aurors. Can you imagine trying to jail beings like this without the dementors? This is the reason why there are no holding cells in the HP universe, because wizards can escape when given half a chance.
