Because the Wizarding world is tiny. We can't comprehend a single person being the attorney general, the U.N. delegate and the Dean of Harvard because that would be insane. Buuuuut.

Higwarts is tiny, 7 year school is smaller than some high schools in the U.S. that are only 4 years. The books make it clear that Dumbledore rarely does anything at the school, because there isn't usually a need for him to do anything. Mostly it seems he just lives there and takes care of issues as his staff brings them up, barring his attachment to Harry.

The Wizengamot likely meets infrequently due to the size of the Wizarding population. Most likely it's a once or twice a month commitment and Dumbledore doesn't seem to need/want to sicilia to further his position, his power comes from his reputation unlike Malfoy' which comes from schmoozing.

The I.C.W. likely meets even less frequently barring some kind of emergency.
