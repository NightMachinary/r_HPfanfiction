No clue why JKR did it but I feel like it's far too much power and work for any one person. Could you imagine someone like Voldemort, Lucius or even Umbridge having that kind of power? The wizarding world would be screwed!

In regards to the dementors I'm pretty sure they could find or create a protective enchantment to seal the dementors away. They could round them all up, seal them away and let them starve themselves out.
