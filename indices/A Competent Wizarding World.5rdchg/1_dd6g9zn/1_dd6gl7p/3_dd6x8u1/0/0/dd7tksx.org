Could have so Dementors pop up in areas where there is large amounts of despair over a period of time. To have so they don't go randomly sucking the souls out of muggles near there could have Dementors drawn towards groups of Dementors (Them thinking that it is an ideal feeding ground). They feet on despair (or was it joy?), and so you can kill them by starvation, but more will pop up.\\
EDIT: *feed not feet
