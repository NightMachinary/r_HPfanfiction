Do you mean a magical oath? Risking your magic, let alone your life, on a statement made in the English language (or any language really) is insane (think about what lawyers can do to the English language). How is corruption defined? Is it the oath-takers personal defintion of corruption (which can be rationalized to anything), or is it based on laws (which can be rewritten by the Wizengamot to anything /after/ you've taken your oath---for example, you might find yourself /required/ to assist Umbridge's campaign against muggleborns without the ability to quit)? For one such exploration of the idea, try the first chapter of linkffn(Knowledge is Useful, But Power is Power by DisobedienceWriter).

Requiring people to take magical oaths turns them into slaves.
