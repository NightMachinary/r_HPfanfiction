- Dumbledore wouldn't hold 3 positions of power because there is really no way for one man to do all that work and do it all competently.
- Dementors would not be the guardians of Azkaban.
- All ministry employee's would be required to take oaths similar to a Hippocratic Oath but instead of "do no harm" it would be more in line with "do not be corrupt".
- Wizengammot would have to do the same as above.
- Hogwarts teaching staff would have to do the same as above.

That's all I can think of.
