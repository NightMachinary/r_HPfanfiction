The issue with Dementors is that they are conventionally unkillable. Yes, they may be able to starve to death, but consider the logistics of locking them away. They are semi solid beings, and therefore would be able to work their way through a solid prison. Normal materials have issues, because they would constantly drop below freezing. Dementors degrade magic and magic users, acting like a sponge for it. If you fail to imprison them the first time, you only have one spell which can be effective against them, and they are able to hunt and kill among the population, breeding all the while. The fact of the matter is that Dementors are the natural predators of Wizards, and unlike humanities predators, Dementors have a degree of intelligence and there is no advantage that the Wizarding World could hold over them.

It actually has some similarities to our problems with nuclear waste. Hideously dangerous, not a pressing problem, and the solution isn't good enough to go forth with.
