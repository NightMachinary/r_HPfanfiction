  security for such things probably exist, but it may not be practical. Especially not for a school.

I'm talking about the Ministry and Gringotts, not Hogwarts. Both of them should be able to afford security good enough to stop 3 teenagers.

AK47s are banned for civilian use, but that doesn't mean that you can just bring one to Capitol Hill. It's even worse for wizarding britain because there are a seelct few buildings that are part of the government that should be protected.

And Gringotts is the major bank of Britain. Security shouldn't be an issue.
