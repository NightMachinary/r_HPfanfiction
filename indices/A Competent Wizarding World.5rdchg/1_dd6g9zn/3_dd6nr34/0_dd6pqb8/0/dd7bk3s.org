I don't tend to trust the Wiki for things like this. It tends to conflate canon, Pottermore, fanon and outright nonsense.

From my memory of the books, we never find out what Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump do, only that Dumbledore doesn't really mind losing these titles. It's worth noting that many Peers in the House of Lords (on which the Wizengamot is based) never attend a single session.
