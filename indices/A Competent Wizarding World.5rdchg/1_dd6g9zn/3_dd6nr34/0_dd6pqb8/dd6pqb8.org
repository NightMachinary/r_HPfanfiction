The wiki is quite vague about what the chief warlock and Supreme Mugwump do but from these sentences they seems quite important:

#+begin_quote
  The Chief Warlock is the title given to the wizard that presides over the Wizengamot, overseeing court procedures.

  The Supreme Mugwump is the name for the head of the International Confederation of Wizards.

Also I imagine having to constantly use a time turner would be quite draining. There's also the fact that if he is delegating a lot of work to McGonogall then he should just hand over the head master position to her and focus on the other two positions.
