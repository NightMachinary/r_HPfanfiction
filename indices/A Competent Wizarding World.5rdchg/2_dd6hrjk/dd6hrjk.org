"Patron", linkffn(11080542): Dumbledore was cool, Dursleys were trying, Fudge was reasonable, Hermione was effective, Lockhart wasn't a fraud, Umbridge wasn't nearly that bad, but Voldemort was utterly terrifying.

I second [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]. Dumbledore was a brilliant strategist, but Ministry was in cahoot with Riddle, so the kids had to step up their games. [[/spoiler][The Order and Team Potter were brutally effective, they killed more than 60 Riddle minions between Dumbledore's death and the start of the next school term, thus giving the Trio the luxury to return to the School. The Carrows never had a chance against Hermione and her roommates later.]]

"The Accidental Animagus", linkffn(9863146): Fudge wasn't stupid, Dumbledore was trying hard, Tonkses were of great help, Lucius Malfoy was a competent antagonist, Draco Malfoy was cunning, Purebloods knew Muggles' problems, Voldemort would actually listen to advice, Barty Jr was a genius, and La Pantera was cool!
