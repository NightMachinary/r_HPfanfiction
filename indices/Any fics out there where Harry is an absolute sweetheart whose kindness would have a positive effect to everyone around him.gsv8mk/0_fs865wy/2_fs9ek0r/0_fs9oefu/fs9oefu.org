The updated date would have you assume so, but the author said it wasn't. But the author has also stated, very boldly, that every time someone asks if it is abandoned, she'll not work on it some more. Which just screams "It's abandoned but I'm too prideful to say so".

So yes, it's abandoned. Which sucks, because I really liked that story when they were actually working on it.
