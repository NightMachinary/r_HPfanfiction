The fic I'm currently writing has a very morally good Harry. I would preface that the story itself is dark, and he's suffering from lots of unaddressed trauma and fights a lot with people like Snape. But on the whole, ultimately, he's pretty pacifist & cares about people's lives (unlike dark!Harry)

If that sounds like something you'd be interested in, feel free to check it out. No hard feelings if it's not your cup of tea. :)
