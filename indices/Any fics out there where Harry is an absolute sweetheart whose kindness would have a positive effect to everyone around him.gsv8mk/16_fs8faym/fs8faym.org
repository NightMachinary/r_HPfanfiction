Despite being unfinished this is one of my all-time favorites linkffn(A Different Start: American Harry Prequel)

I feel I should mention that it is a heavy AU and that besides Harry and to the exceptions of some passing mentions every chapter is an OC this, in my opinion, adds to the quality of what the story set out to do but it may not be the majority opinion.
