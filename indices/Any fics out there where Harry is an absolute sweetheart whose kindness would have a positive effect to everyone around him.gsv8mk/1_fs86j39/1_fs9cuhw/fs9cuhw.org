There's also Enter the Dragon, on the Questionable Questing forums. Being a dragon, Harry matures a bit more slowly than humans, so he's a cheerful, boisterous, friendly eleven-year-old who can also eat railway cars in his native form and tank killing curses. He's overpowered to the point of sometimes being ridiculous, but it's a lot of fun - and he's living in a harsh world, where even his ludicrous levels of brute strength can't solve problems like magic-assisted human trafficking.
