THIS ONE: Unfortunately it's not finished linkffn(To the Waters and the Wild)

It's super crack, but Harry is basically this innocent child raised by faeries. He gets everyone to get along with his fairy magic

Edit: you can easily ignore the slash in this one but I think the author is going for a same age relationship between young tom riddle and harry which only began with a gentle friendship since harry is only eleven. super worth the read.
