You have to check out this one, then.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230340/1/Harry-Is-A-Dragon-And-That-s-Okay]]

Beyond the basic premise (Harry is a dragon) this version of him is a lot more practical and less sassy. One of my favourite moments went something like this (I'd Cory and paste but my browser won't let me):

Draco: Enjoy Hogwarts while you can, Potter. My father's coming and he'll have you and all the other animals thrown out of this school!

Harry: {thinks} Thank you, Draco!

Draco: Excuse me?

Harry: Well, you couldn't have just come here to warn me, because you're a Slytherin and that would be a Gryffindor thing to do. But if you came here to /gloat/, and just happened to let slip what your father's up to? That would be a very sneaky and very Slytherin way to tip me off. So thank you!

Draco: I - you - um . . .

And the fic is just full of moments like that. This is a version of Harry who initially thinks that being asked to do garden work by Petunia is a reward for good behaviour because it means he gets to eat the delicious clippings. (Again, dragon.)

EDIT: Just looked down and it's already been mentioned. Still well worth a look!
