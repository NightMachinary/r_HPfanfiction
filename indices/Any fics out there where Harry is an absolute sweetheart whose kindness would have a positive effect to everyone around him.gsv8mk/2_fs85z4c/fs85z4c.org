Oh, man, I swear to God that I read a fic like that ages ago. I don't really remember any details, except some loose points. For example, apparently McGonagall didn't approve of the Dursleys from the beginning, and took Harry with her, so now baby Harry lived in the castle. This leads to several interactions between Harry and the staff and students throughout the years. Older students take care of Harry when the staff if busy with classes. At some point, Harry sits in the Slytherin table, and this leads to an unlikely friendship with one of them. I can't remember who, I only remember that he was one of the bad guys in canon (could have been Warrington?). Thanks to this, he eventually develops a decent personality and when he graduates he works for the Ministry, I think, not sure if as an auror or something.

I tried to find the fic in my favorites list, but I can't find anything that resembles that. I hate when that happens. If anyone knows what story I'm talking about, please tell me so I can archive it properly this time.

EDIT: Aw, crap, it just dawned on me that it could have been one of those long-ass Tumblr posts reposted on Facebook, in which case it's gone forever. FML.
