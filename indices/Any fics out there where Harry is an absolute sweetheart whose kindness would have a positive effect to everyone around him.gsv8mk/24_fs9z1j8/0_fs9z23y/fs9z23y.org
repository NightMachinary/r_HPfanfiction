#+begin_quote
  Harry didn't have the authority of the Ministry. He didn't have the reputation of the Dark Lord. He didn't have the influence of Lucius Malfoy. At heart, he was a simple tailor. "But anyone who had heard of Harry Potter knew that he was more than just a simple tailor. He was a good master." Abused, wise-beyond-years Harry.
