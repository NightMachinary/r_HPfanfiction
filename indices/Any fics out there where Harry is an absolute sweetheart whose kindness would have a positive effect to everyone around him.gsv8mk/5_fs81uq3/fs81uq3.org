[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3390668/chapters/7419224]] - C'est La Vie: Harry goes to an alternate dimension and improves the lives of the people around him

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1926747/chapters/4159479]] - Family Bonds: older tropey fic, WBWL Harry but he still loves his family and is kind to everyone

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12006417/chapters/27167826]] - Survival is a talent: I read this recently, one of the few Drarry I have ever enjoyed mostly because it's a friendship fic before its a romance fic, Harry is pretty kind and his friendships with the people around him are a central part of the fic
