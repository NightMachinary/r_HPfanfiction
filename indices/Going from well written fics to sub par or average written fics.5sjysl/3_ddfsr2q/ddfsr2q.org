Eh, whenever I get that feeling, and it is something I want to read, I do one or more of the following:

1. Read a Dragon Ball Z crossover (terrible all of them)

2. Remind myself that I own or have seen /Plan 9 from Outer Space/, /Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter/, /Conan the Destroyer/, /Fury of the Wolfman/, /Billy the Kid vs Dracula/, /The Star Wars Holiday Special/, /Blood Tide/, /Sssssss/, /Death Wish V: The Face of Death/ and many, many, many more absolutely terrible movies.

Those really get me past the quality barrier outside of the absolute worst ones.
