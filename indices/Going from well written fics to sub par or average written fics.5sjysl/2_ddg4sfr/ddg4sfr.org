It's natural when you are first getting into fan fiction to read the most popular and well-reviewed fics, which generally are well-written and engaging. Then, out of a desire to want to continue reading more about your favorite characters, you find yourself reading worse and worse fan fiction. I'm at the point now where I will willingly put up with grammatical mistakes or flawed prose if the story concept is interesting. I've just grown to accept that most of the actual writing won't be good.
