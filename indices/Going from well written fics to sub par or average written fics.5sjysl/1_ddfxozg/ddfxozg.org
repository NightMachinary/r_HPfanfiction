Yeah... I can't even remember the last time I finished an HP fic that wasn't a reread. Most times I struggle to even get through the first few chapters. After a while, they all start looking the same, and then you realize that they really are almost just the same, and that the vast majority of fics suck. But it's that .01% that you keep searching for.
