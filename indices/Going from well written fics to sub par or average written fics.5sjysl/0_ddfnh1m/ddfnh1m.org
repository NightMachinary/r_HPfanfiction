Yeah, I have this issue somewhat too. If I sort my favorites/bookmarks by when I added them on AO3/FFN, I can read and enjoy most of what I added in the last few years. But if I go back to what I liked well enough to favorite in 2010, most of it is absolutely horrible garbage. My tastes have changed, I got older, and I've read a much broader range of stories, so I have a much lower tolerance for what I'm willing to sit through and read.
