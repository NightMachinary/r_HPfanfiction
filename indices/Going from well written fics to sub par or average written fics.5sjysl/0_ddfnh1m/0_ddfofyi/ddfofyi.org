When I started fanfic I started with Naruto x Hinata (before the manga ended) fanfics and back than I thought the things I read was really well written but now when I go back to it I can barely stand it (even though i still like the concepts that different authors have). I think the first author that made me not want to go back to those stories is Kur0Kishi (End Game Version R). What's yours?
