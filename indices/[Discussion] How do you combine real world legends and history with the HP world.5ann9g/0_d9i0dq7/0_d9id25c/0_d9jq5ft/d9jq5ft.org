There's also Emrys (or Ambrosius if you want the Latinised name) the Romano-Brittish Seer and warlord. Though he doesn't actually have Merlin in his name...

I'm angling for a muggle-raised half-blood Merlin (for his 'demonic' ancestry) in the 1070-80s or so with the Marcher Lords. Similar level of disruption as the Anarchy but in Wales and it gives it a bit of time for things to get mixed up before Geoffrey writes it all down. The Anarchy is also a great choice though.
