For the Camelot idea in Potterverse, Arthur as he exist in the legends never existed, he is a amalgam of several rulers all folded into one. Merlin was the man behind the royals at the time leading the then magical community, and while some if not most of the Arthurian legends actually happend it wasn't to the same man/men but rather their bloodlines over a 100 year period (people forget that us Humans used to only live like 50 years back then) not including assassinations and stuff.

Gawain who joined the Round table isn't the Gawain who had a run in with the Holy Grail. The Lancelot who fought Galahad isn't the Lancelot who slept with Guinevere.
