That's a silly question. HP magic isn't supposed to work like this.

The better question is whether the blood wards were all that vital for Harry's protection. There are other magical protections that seem quite useful and I have my doubts that the blood protections at Privet Drive were as effective as Dumbledore made them out to be, since they are based on familial love and the idea of calling Privet Drive his "home".
