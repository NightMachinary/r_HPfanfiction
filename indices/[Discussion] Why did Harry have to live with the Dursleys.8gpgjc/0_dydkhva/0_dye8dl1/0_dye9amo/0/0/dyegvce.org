  No. 4 let Dobby in because he didn't have any harmful intent (at that time) towards Harry.

I'm aware, hence why I said he could have Dobby Apparate Harry out. Apparition isn't inherently harmful, so Dobby isn't doing anything wrong. Or hell, we know Dobby could do magic there so Lucius (or whoever) could have their elf do something which indirectly handles the matter without directly seeking to harm him. Dobby, after all, did so.

I think those examples prove that the bond of blood was no better in protecting Harry in general than something lie Fidelius, meaning Dumbledore placing Harry there was negligence. If he can be attacked up the street from Number 4 then that enchantment is no safer. He'd be vulnerable most days for most of the day while at school...
