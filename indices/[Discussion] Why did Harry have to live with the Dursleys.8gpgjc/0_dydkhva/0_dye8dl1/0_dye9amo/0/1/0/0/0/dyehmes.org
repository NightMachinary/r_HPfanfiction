Haha, great. ðŸ˜‚

Sneak a Vanishing Cabinet to Number 4 (Undetectable Extension Charm to the rescue!). Pottermore tells us they were literally created during the first wizarding war for this sort of thing. You know Death Eaters are coming so you hop in one and appear out the other at the Burrow. Can't be imprisoned either (because this is your concern right now...) since it's not Apparition, Portkeying nor Flooing. ðŸ‘Œ
