I actually have a list for this occasion! Feel free to give me your own ideas and I might add them to my file! [or tell me when something is stupid]

Methods for Harry to escape from Privet Drive in DH.

1. Moody says: "A. Pius Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He's made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a Portkey here, or Apparate in or out.". They think the Minister is loyal to Voldemort and they are worried to commit an imprisonable offense? WHO CARES AT THIS POINT?! Just make a portkey. They are out to kill you and subjugate all of your loved ones, it literally doesn't matter if they want to imprison you too.

2. Invisibility Cloak: Harry just walks out of the House on a random day and takes a bus to anywhere. Portkey from there.

3. Polyjuice/Animagus: McGonagall walks in to visit Harry and leaves an hour later. During the night a cat jumps the fence.

4. Polyjuice/Metamorphagus: Nymphadora visits Harry and leaves an hour later. No one takes notice of "Petunia" going on a shopping trip she never returns from later.

5. Polyjuice: Dudley Dursley takes a ride on a bus. He never returns.

6. Harry takes off his glasses and wears a fake moustache. Leaving the house in broad daylight he takes the bus to the next town. Or just takes a long walk.

7. Polyjuice: Order members take polyjuice and get their pictures taken anywhere outside of Surrey pretending to be Harry. Leak picture to the daily prophet. If you want be really elaborate get seen in Hogsmeade or somewhere else. Be real Harry: No one care about Privet Drive anymore

8. Vanishing Cabinet: Acquire a pair.

9. Build a giant wooden horse with a garland that spells in huge letters "HAPPY BIRTHDAY HARRY!". Roll it in front of the entrance of the house. Roll it away a day later. [still makes more sense than that Seven Potters crap]

It makes absolutely no sense to me that they would intentionally create such a huge hubbub.
