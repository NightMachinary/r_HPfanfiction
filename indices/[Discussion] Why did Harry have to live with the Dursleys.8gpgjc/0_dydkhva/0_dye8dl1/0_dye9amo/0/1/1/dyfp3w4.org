Indeed - why polyjuice people into Harry, why not Harry into someone ELSE, someone nobody is looking for (hell, maybe even into a girl so that DEs etc. are even less likely to think it's Harry)?

Rowling is decent at world building (yes, decent - not great because so many things aren't fleshed out - sure, that's why fanfiction works so well in that universe, but doesn't do the story itself any favours IMHO!), but she's not a great storyteller, because her stories have plotholes large enough to fit a supertanker through with room to spare!
