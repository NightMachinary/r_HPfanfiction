  Also even though Voldemort controlled the Ministry he still thought it was easier to attack Harry while he was on the move rather than when he was stranded at No 4.

I'm not sure that an argument that goes "Voldemort would do the smart/sensible thing" is very compelling right after a sentence about "The Battle of the Seven Potters", which was the smartest plan a bunch of Order of the Phoenix members and Aurors could apparently come up with. I'm not going to spell out how idiotic that whole ordeal was (and it cost poor Hedwig her life).

Just from that alone I'm very reluctant to follow any line of argument that presupposes "surely a Wizard A would just do the simple thing X if it were possible". Evidently they don't. They prefer to do the most convoluted and stupid thing imaginable in order to appear clever.
