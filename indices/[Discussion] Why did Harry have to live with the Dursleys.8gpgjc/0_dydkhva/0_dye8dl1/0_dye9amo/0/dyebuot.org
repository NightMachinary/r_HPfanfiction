The second one is something I hadn't considered so good point, but there's still Dumbledore's own protections to take into account. As for the house elf problem, while this is true there is also no known way to protect against it. Also while this is pure speculation it is possible the the protective charms around No. 4 let Dobby in because he didn't have any harmful intent (at that time) towards Harry.

Finally, the only two times that Harry is ever attacked in Surrey where the Dementor attack in OotP and the in the battle of the seven Potters. Both times Harry was outside of the area that was covered by the charm. Also even though Voldemort controlled the Ministry he still thought it was easier to attack Harry while he was on the move rather than when he was stranded at No 4.
