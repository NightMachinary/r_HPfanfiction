Well, I mean, I don't know if Dumbledore is to blame to be honest, because he is beyond idiotic when it comes to handling children. He has the understanding of an old loaf of bread, I don't know if I can blame someone who is so obviously unable to understand his actions. What person in their right mind tries to scare an 11 year old completely neglected orphan into submission, when they see that said child has massive problem with feeling empathy for others. I mean, SERIOUSLY? And this whole "he was conceived in rape, he cannot feel love" - exFUCKINGcuse me?! Are you for real, dude? All in all, why on earth is a man that never even had a stabke relationship, let alone a family wizarding Britain's main authority on how to raise children? ahh.
