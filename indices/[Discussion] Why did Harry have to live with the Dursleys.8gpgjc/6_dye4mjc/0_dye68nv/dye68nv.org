  the Harry Potter books idealize abusive childhoods as something that is the ultimate test of character.

That's why a certain fanon theory really tickles my sense of humor: Dumbledore is running a sick nature vs. nurture experiment to prove that a bad childhood doesn't turn a good person into a Dark Lord. Surely, a naturally good person would persevere through this test of character! Therefore Dumbledore is not to blame for Voldemort by not helping to make a better home for him.
