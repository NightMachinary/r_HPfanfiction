It is hard to understand why Petunia is necessary at all. She has no magic, she did not love Harry (if anything she tried to seriously injure him with a frying pan) and the Dursleys treatment proves the protection to be completely impotent. And it also did nothing against Wormtail. It is a badly designed plot device, nothing else.
