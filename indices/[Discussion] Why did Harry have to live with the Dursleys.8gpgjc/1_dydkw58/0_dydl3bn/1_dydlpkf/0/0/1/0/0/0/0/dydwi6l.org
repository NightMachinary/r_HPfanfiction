Um, how? Voldemort even as a teen was quite aware of the magic Lily used. There's nothing to suggest he was incorrect about the enchantment residing in his blood too. That's the explanation for for he could bypass it. His only mistake was not realizing that taking on the enchantment made him a pseudo Horcrux for Harry (Dumbledore also says in DH that Voldemort took in Lily's enchantment).

Edit: I think we're saying the same thing. What was the disagreement? lol
