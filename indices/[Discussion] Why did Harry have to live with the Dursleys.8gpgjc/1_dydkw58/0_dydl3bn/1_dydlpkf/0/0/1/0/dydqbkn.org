But this is also a part of the power that Voldemort knows not. When Harry mentioned this to Dumbledore afterwards, we see the line that his eyes flashed in victory. Dumbledore understood that despite Voldemort's intention and thoughts on the matter, that by taking Harry's blood he made himself weaker, not stronger.

While it is true that due to the process, Voldemort was then able to touch Harry without burning alive. In the overall scheme, Voldemort traded away his long term goal (remaining forever unchallenged), for a short term reward. In short, Voldemort opened a door, to close a window.

Essentially, you have to treat Voldemort as an unreliable narrator in that instance, as he is talking about things he doesn't fully understand.
