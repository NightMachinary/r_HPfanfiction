  “The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that Harry has powerful protection while he can still call this house ‘home.'"

And here's where the manipulative Dumbledore comes in... After Voldemort gets Harry's blood, the only thing protecting Harry is Dumbledore's own magic. Otherwise Voldemort could have waltzed right in - if he can now touch Harry without harm, he should have been able to enter Privet Drive, too. So a vial of Petunia's blood would be worthless since it's a different spell that Dumbledore used.
