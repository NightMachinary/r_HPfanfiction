The charm used by Dumbledore is (in my headcanon) a riff on the cross-cultural imperative known as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality][Hospitality]], or perhaps an aspect of it covering Fosterage/Patronage. By accepting Harry into her home, Petunia had taken personal responsibility for his safety. Empowered by her sister's last act, Petunia protected Harry from (magical) harm until he was an adult.

My take on the post-graveyard status is that Voldemort could have gone to the Dursleys, but still wouldn't be able to use magic there to harm Harry.
