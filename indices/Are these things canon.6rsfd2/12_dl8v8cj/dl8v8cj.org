No. I don't think so at least but while we're on the topic, are these canon?

-Sirius and James are stupid. I recall McGonagall saying they were too bright for their own good or was it a fanfiction?

-Lily is the brightest witch of her age. I seem to recall that this was about Hermione. I skimmed the books for ages and checked Pottermore but I can't find this about Lily. All it ever said was that she was clever at Potions. That quote applies to Hermione. Am I missing out on something?

-Is Marlene McKinnon Lily's best friend? I also skimmed every single page of the books but never stumbled upon her name. The only time was when she was listed as a member of the Order and that's it. Same with Emmeline Vance, Dorcas Meadowes and Hestia Jones. I'm very puzzled.

I actually don't have problems with some tropes as long as they don't contradict canon. But Ron the Death Eater (where the hell did that come from?) and Hadrian Potter lord of Black-Gamp-Malfoy-Gryffindor-Merlin-Newton-Picasso-Bill Gates (what the hell?) where did these come from?
