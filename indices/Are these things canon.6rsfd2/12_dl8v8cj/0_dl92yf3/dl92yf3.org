  Lily is the brightest witch of her age. I seem to recall that this was about Hermione. I skimmed the books for ages and checked Pottermore but I can't find this about Lily. All it ever said was that she was clever at Potions. That quote applies to Hermione. Am I missing out on something?

That's fanon trying to make Lily into a Hermione.

  Is Marlene McKinnon Lily's best friend? I also skimmed every single page of the books but never stumbled upon her name. The only time was when she was listed as a member of the Order and that's it. Same with Emmeline Vance, Dorcas Meadowes and Hestia Jones. I'm very puzzled.

Fanon. Was in a popular fic ages ago, and it stuck ever since.

  I actually don't have problems with some tropes as long as they don't contradict canon. But Ron the Death Eater (where the hell did that come from?) and Hadrian Potter lord of Black-Gamp-Malfoy-Gryffindor-Merlin-Newton-Picasso-Every single person's family (what the hell?) where did these come from?

From people Trying to fix canon Harry. They think if they make him into Super!Harry, Indy!Harry, Lord!Harry that would make him better. It often does not. Ron the Death Eater comes from movies shitty portrayal of Ron.
