Thank god! I always found it a bit odd that Sirius and James were portrayed as stupid when they were the youngest animagi ever as far as we know. They created the Marauders' Map and nothing like that exists in canon until now. They were abducted into the Order /right after graduation/. Seriously. I also never understood the concept that Remus was cleverer than them because he was studious and bookish. I'm glad that McGonagall describing them as too bright for their own good is canon.

I think that they are overshadowed by Snape. Snape had fifteen years to practice while Sirius was on the run and James was dead. I'm sure that had they lived out their lives properly then they would have become prodigies like Snape.

Besides, we know that Bellatrix had already graduated when Sirius was just starting his first year at Hogwarts. While they both admittedly served a lot of time in Azkaban, Bellatrix already had had /much more practice/ than Sirius when he joined the Order. When they duelled, they seemed equal. If it weren't for Sirius getting too cocky then the fight would've lasted much longer I'd expect. Sirius lasted better than Kingsley, actually. Thats not bad for a man thats been out of practice for /15 years/.

I'm really glad that isn't actually canon. I think because that they were troublemakers people interpret that as fools. Troublemaker does not equal stupid. Look at Fred and George. Also, Sirius wasn't exactly the smartest man in OotP but that wasn't the point of his character. It's understandable - Sirius spent 16 years of his life living with his parents, 12 years of his life being mentally and emotionally tortured while being starved. 3 on the run and 'free'. He only ever truly spent time with James for around 10 years? Maybe 11? He sent more time in Azkaban than with his best friend. *Ouch*. He returned into his childhood house where he was 99.9% most likely abused. Of course he was going to crack!

  That's fanon trying to make Lily into a Hermione
#+end_quote

Thank you! I will close a fan fiction when Lily is Hermione. Lily was her own person - not Hermione. Lily was charming, cheeky, very funny and vivacious. She also seemed extroverted. I don't get how she's suddenly introverted, a bookworm, a know-it-all and all panicky about exams. Lily seemed relaxed in canon. If I had to choose a character who Lily is the most like in personality, that'd be Ginny (not that she /is/ Ginny). Just because she and Hermione were both smart mugglebron witches doesn't mean that they both had the same personality. I kinda get where they are coming from - I really do but Lily was her own person, get over it.

Honestly, to me, Lily is overrated in brains. I don't get why they are now applying a quote about Hermione onto Lily but whatever. Lily was only ever described as clever at potions. Nothing else. She had a wand good for charms but that doesn't automatically mean that she was the Princess of Enchanters.

When they bring up being Head Girl, I always say that that doesn't necessarily mean that she was the smartest of her year. A girl in her year might've been a child prodigy but maybe she didn't have good leadership abilities. Head Girl isn't just given out to good grades. It's also for someone who has good leadership abilities, decent grades and a personality people would aspire to have.

Thrice defied. When this comes up I sorta roll my eyes. It seems farfetched that two teenagers barely out of school would duel the greatest dark wizard that ever surfaced on the planet and /thwart/ him. Three freakin' times. Worse yet, coming away unscathed. I take thrice defied as this, personally: Joining the Order, refusing his offer to join the Death Eaters and getting married.

I hate the fact that Voldemort wanted to recruit a muggleborn witch but that means that Lily must've been exceptional if Voldemort wasn't more interested in James than Lily that is. Honestly, if he wants to recruit a pureblood wizard from a filthy rich, extremely powerful family then he'd have a look at his wife before even knowing her blood status and her capabilities. Remember, Voldemort didn't only seek powerful duelists but he also sought well-connected and respected families - we can tell that from Lucius Malfoy.

Marlene McKinnon and her whole newly given personality always irked me. I'm glad for an answer. Thanks! Did you mean /The Life and Times/, though?

  Ron the Death Eater comes from movies shitty portrayal of Ron.
#+end_quote

I was always disappointed by Ron's portray in the films. When he stands on his broken foot to tell a mass murderer that he needs to kill him first instead of his best friend that was truly wonderful. But they gave that moment to Hermione. /Of course/, while Ron whined in the background.

Thanks for answering my questions though! =)
