You are welcome.

  Lily was her own person - not Hermione. Lily was charming, cheeky, very funny and vivacious. She also seemed extroverted. I don't get how she's suddenly introverted, a bookworm, a know-it-all and all panicky about exams. Lily seemed relaxed in canon. If I had to choose a character who Lily is the most like in personality, that'd be Ginny (not that she is Ginny).

In fanon, people see Lily as either Hermione or Ginny. (Sarcasm) Of course, she couldn't be her own person. Blasphemy. (Sarcasm)

  She had a wand good for charms but that doesn't automatically mean that she was the Princess of Enchanters.

In fanon, Lily is the goddess of Charms, while James is a god of Transfiguration.
