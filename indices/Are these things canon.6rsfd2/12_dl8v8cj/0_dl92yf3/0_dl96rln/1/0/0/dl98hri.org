And don't get me started on Hermione! Some people just worship Hermione as some sort of Wizarding God. I have read fics where she is the answer to all problems and the smartest/most powerful witch since Merlin. That just pisses me off. I don't like how people somehow equate 'Smartest Witch her age' to being Einstein levels of genius. I mean, there was a fic where she was developing a counter to Avada Kedavra...in Second Year.(Meaning bringing people back to life, and not as Inferi)
