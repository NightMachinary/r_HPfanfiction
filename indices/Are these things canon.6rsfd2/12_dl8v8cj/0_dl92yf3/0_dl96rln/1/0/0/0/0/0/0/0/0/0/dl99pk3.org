That's okay. My point was that she didn't cast it on purpose. So I'm fine with what kind of thing it is.

Jo didn't say that Hermione is black. I think that what she meant is that it is okay to interpret her as black. I actually now imagine her as black because of the fan art. It looks much better than my former Hermione. Anyway, you can imagine her as orange or green - it doesn't matter.
