But you don't know, do you? Lily is not only a goddes of charms. Lily defies all of Gamp's Laws of Transfiguration because she is secretly the descant of Merlin and the four founders! Lily Evans could cast the patronus charm at the age of 11 both wandlessly and non verbally! She gets straight 'O's in every single subject without studying and she was offered to be moved into Seventh Year when she was just 11. How very dare you say such things about Lily Evans! The mother of Harry Potter!

In all seriousness though, Lily is criminally overrated and underrated. I can't comprehend why Lily can't be her won person - I just can't. When she /is/ her own person then she defies most of her characteristics of canon - like extroversion and sociability. Oh yes, she also suddenly makes a veela look like a troll.

She is underrated by *some* and only some Snape fans. 'Why did she end the friendship! OMG! She's just as bad as James!'

It's because she knows her selfworth - get over yourself.
