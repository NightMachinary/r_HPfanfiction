Yeah! Totally. I'm sure they would have been known as the 'second Dumbledores'

Besides, I really want to understand how Remus is portrayed as smarter than them. Just because he's a bookworm, studious and bookish doesn't mean that he is smarter. He himself says that Sirius and James were the smartest in the entire school. McGonagall says that they were too bright for their own good.
