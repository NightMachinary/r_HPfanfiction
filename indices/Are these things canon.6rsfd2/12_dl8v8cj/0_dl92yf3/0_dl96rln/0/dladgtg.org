Here are some quote about the two marauders :

/"Black and Potter. Ringleaders of their little gang. Both very bright, of course--exceptionally bright, in fact--but I don't think we've ever had such a pair of troublemakers --"/

Minerva Mcgonagall PoA

/It took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it. Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong--one reason the Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it./

Remus Lupin PoA

/"Look, Harry, what you've got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did - everyone thought they were the height of cool"/

Remus Lupin OoTP

I often use them to counter those claiming they are dumb for some reasons probably due to Jo's fail to depict that cleverness into act or simply due to a personnal dislike for the characters. The two marauders are usually opposed to Snape and his cleverness being his main -if not the best of his- traits I imagine that it is painful to have his nemesis rivalling or even surpassing him on that matter.
