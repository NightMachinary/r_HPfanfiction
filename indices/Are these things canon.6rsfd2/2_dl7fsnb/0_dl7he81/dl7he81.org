  This was true according to Pottermore. Before plumbing, wizards would poop wherever they wanted and then vanish it

Vanishing isn't really an enchantment or rune (and for that matter, there's little evidence that runes themselves have magical power). It's a spell you cast on the spot. I'm pretty sure he was referring to the idea that the toilets are enchanted with a "vanishing flush".

  -Definitely not true. The killing curse requires hatred and there's a reason for that.

Common fanon misconception. It's never stated that you need hate to cast the killing curse. It is only stated that you need power - by fake Moody in GoF.
