Debatable. Moody was a Death Eater in Disguise. He could not go around preaching the truth about the Unforgivables. It'd be a red flag. So it's unclear if his info is reliable. Plus the man's insane. So is Bellatrix. Her info could also be unreliable. So you could be right. Taure's second point could also be right(probably is). His first point could also be right. Personally, I agree with the First and Second points he made.
