  It's unclear if Bellatrix is reliable on this matter, because in DH Harry casts the Cruciatus successfully with righteous anger, exactly the thing Bellatrix says is not possible in OotP.

Why would Bellatrix ever be a reliable source of information for the protagonist anyway? She'd say whatever the fuck she wants if its suited to get under Harry's skin.

If she told Harry that water is wet I'd seriously consider the possibility that it isn't.
