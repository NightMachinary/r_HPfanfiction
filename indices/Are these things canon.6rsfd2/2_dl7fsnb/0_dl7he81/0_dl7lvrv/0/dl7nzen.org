  Bellatrix tells Harry righteous anger is not enough for the Cruciatus, he needs to truly hate the person he's casting it at. I believe the same is true for the other two Unforgivables.
#+end_quote

1. What she says is that he needs to "mean it". So with the Cruciatus to be able to cast it, he has to genuinely want the person in pain (as opposed to merely wanting them disabled). With the Killing Curse, he would need to genuinely want the person dead. That doesn't require hate, merely the desire for the curse to do its job.

2. In any case, it's not clear if what she says applies to all the Unforgiveables or just the Cruciatus. She introduces it as about the Unforgiveables, but goes on to say more that clearly only applies to the Cruciatus. So the text is ambiguous.

3. It's unclear if Bellatrix is reliable on this matter, because in DH Harry casts the Cruciatus successfully with righteous anger, exactly the thing Bellatrix says is not possible in OotP.
