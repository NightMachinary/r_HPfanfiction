Sewage and other waste is magically vanished by common enchantments and runes. -This was true according to Pottermore. Before plumbing, wizards would poop wherever they wanted and then vanish it

The killing and imperio curse is used on farm animals (or a similar magic by house elves) -Definitely not true. The killing curse requires hatred and there's a reason for that.

Couples use lust potions in the bedroom -Not canon but it is plausible. You can use it in your fics.

Inmates at askaban are fed nourishment potions by the dementors -No idea. We're never told how inmates are fed.

There's a gringotts branch in every major wizarding country. -Never mentioned in canon, you can say it's true if you want to.

Asia and eastern europe are much more accepting of dark magic and therefore dont have problems with "dark lords". -Definitely not true. The Japanese school wears school robes that turn white if you use Dark Magic. This is mentioned to be a terrible disgrace, which results in expulsion and a trial at their Ministry

Snakes are magically bound to obey parseltongues unless specifically enchanted like the basilisk. -No evidence towards it in canon.

Wands are custom crafted for customers in knocturn alley / Ollivander does custom crafts for a high price. -No evidence in canon.

The ministry doesn't shut down knocturn alley because theres a huge % of wizards who secretly use dark magic. -They don't shut it down because it isn't what fanon says it is. It's a regular alley, it just has a few shady people in it.

There are Veela covens in the world and sometimes a lucky guy gets to visit. -No idea.

Mastering and tapping into the power of accidental magic is the key to wandless magic. -No evidence towards it but it makes sense. Magic is guided by willpower.
