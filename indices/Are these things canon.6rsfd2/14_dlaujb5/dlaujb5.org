Little of this is canon (I'm thinking especially of the 'sewage' thing, as runes aren't magic in canon, of snakes being bound to Parselmouths, and of custom-crafted wands), though some of it isn't /contradicted/ by canon (Gringotts branches in other countries, the Ministry not shutting down Knockturn because the relevant officials are corrupt themselves).

I'm not sure about wandless magic. /Some/ of it presumably works as you describe, judging from Tom's pre-Hogwarts mastery of wandless magic. However, it seems that in other cases advanced wizards perform simple spells by waving around their hand mimicking the wand movement, which is something else entirely.
