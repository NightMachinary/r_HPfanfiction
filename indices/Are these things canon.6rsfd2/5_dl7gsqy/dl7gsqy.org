  Asia and eastern Europe are much more accepting of dark magic and therefore don't have problems with "dark lords".

OK, see, this is the only one on the list that I even understand where it /came/ from. Everything else is 100% fanon, if not flat-out BS. We know from GoF that Dark Arts /are/ widely taught at Durmstrang (or at least, they were under Karkaroff's tenure as headmaster), but we also know from DH that Grindelwald was expelled and that at least some Durmstrang students (such as Krum) viewed Grindelwald with distaste. So the idea that they are more accepting of Dark magic there is only /semi-/true.
