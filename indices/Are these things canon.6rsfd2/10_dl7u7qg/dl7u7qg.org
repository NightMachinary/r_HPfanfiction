First off as far as canon goes- whether you like it or not- it is anything written by the author for the universe she created. The same goes for any book series. So the books (yes, even the play,) Fantastic Beasts, Pottermore, etc, anything she wrote or helped write is canon. This doesn't mean it's perfect or doesn't contradict itself sometimes. She's human after all.

Anything outside of the canon established by the author is fanon. This reddit page deals specifically in fanon.

Now, on the topic of Ollivander making customs wands, that would be false. His father did work that way, and in earlier times that was how it worked. I suppose that there may be possible with non-Ollivander wandmakers, but so far as the man himself, it's the wand chooses the wizard. (Read about how Ollivander used to watch his father make custom wands with inferior cores because people commissioned him to.)
