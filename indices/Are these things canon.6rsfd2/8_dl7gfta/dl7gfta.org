I don't want to sound rude, but did you actually read the series? Every single thing on that list is fanon.

#+begin_quote
  Sewage and other waste is magically vanished by common enchantments and runes.
#+end_quote

This is fanon, enchantments are canon, but runes are just a written language, also Hogwarts has Plumbing, see the Basilisk or the Chamber of Secrets.

#+begin_quote
  The killing and imperio curse is used on farm animals (or a similar magic by house elves)
#+end_quote

They are never explored outside of the context of using them on Humans.

#+begin_quote
  Couples use lust potions in the bedroom
#+end_quote

Total fanon.

#+begin_quote
  Inmates at askaban are fed nourishment potions by the dementors
#+end_quote

I've never even heard this before, usually, fanon is happy to let prisoners become horrifically malnourished.

#+begin_quote
  There's a gringotts branch in every major wizarding country.
#+end_quote

Fanon.

#+begin_quote
  Asia and eastern europe are much more accepting of dark magic and therefore dont have problems with "dark lords".
#+end_quote

This is fanon derived from Dumstrangs rep. Dumstrang had a rep of producing dark wizards, it's in eastern Europe so logically the rest of eastern Europe must be accepting of dark magic right? Also, Asia was never even mentioned canon.

#+begin_quote
  Snakes are magically bound to obey parseltongues unless specifically enchanted like the basilisk.
#+end_quote

Pure fanon.

#+begin_quote
  Wands are custom crafted for customers in knocturn alley / Ollivander does custom crafts for a high price.
#+end_quote

We see Ollivander like three times in the series, he gave Harry a wand, checked out the champions wands, and talked about wand lore.

#+begin_quote
  The ministry doesn't shut down knocturn alley because theres a huge % of wizards who secretly use dark magic.
#+end_quote

Knockturn Alley just has a sketchy rep, it's basically the run down part of town where you'll probably get mugged, offered drugs, or meet really sketchy people. The only established store there was Borgin and Burkes which was a pawn shop that bought illegal stuff under the table.

#+begin_quote
  There are Veela covens in the world and sometimes a lucky guy gets to visit.
#+end_quote

Canon establishes two, possibly three, things about Veela, they are unbelievably hot to the point it is hypnotic, they can transform in Harpy like creatures, and some set of rules relating to interspecies breeding. Fyi allure is fanon.

#+begin_quote
  Mastering and tapping into the power of accidental magic is the key to wandless magic.
#+end_quote

Absolutely unadulterated fanon. Wandless magic is never explored in canon.
