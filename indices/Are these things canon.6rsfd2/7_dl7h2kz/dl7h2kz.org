  Sewage and other waste is magically vanished by common enchantments and runes.
#+end_quote

plumping is mentioned in the books and runes are only used in the contex of being translated and nothing suggest its more than a old language.

#+begin_quote
  The killing and imperio curse is used on farm animals
#+end_quote

its unknown how farm animals are treated but the use of unforgivables would unnecessarily restrict this rather simple profession to people who are powerful/skillful enough to cast such magic

#+begin_quote
  Couples use lust potions in the bedroom
#+end_quote

these are childrens books of course lust potions arent mentioned. But it would be rather plausible for wizards to develop such a thing.

#+begin_quote
  Inmates at askaban are fed nourishment potions by the dementors
#+end_quote

nourishment potions arent mentioned in canon, but it was mentioned that there is food in azkaban in the contex of prisoners stopping to eat.

#+begin_quote
  There's a gringotts branch in every major wizarding country.
#+end_quote

We know they employ bill as cursebreaker in Egypt, but we dont know about other branches.

#+begin_quote
  Asia and eastern Europe are much more accepting of dark magic and therefore dont have problems with "dark lords".
#+end_quote

We know of one school in europe that is more tolerant towards the dark arts, but we dont know anything about the cultures. And there are no dark lords, there are dark wizards and only voldemort is called dark lord.

#+begin_quote
  Snakes are magically bound to obey parseltongues unless specifically enchanted like the basilisk.
#+end_quote

no, the gaunts had to threaten snakes to obey them and the snake malfoy summoned was reluctant to listen to harry.

#+begin_quote
  Wands are custom crafted for customers in knocturn alley / Ollivander does custom crafts for a high price.
#+end_quote

Its unknown but unlikly because a custom crafted wand cant choose you.

#+begin_quote
  The ministry doesn't shut down knocturn alley because theres a huge % of wizards who secretly use dark magic.
#+end_quote

the ministry investigates even if a family as influential as the malfoys owns dark objects, so that a unlikely reason.

#+begin_quote
  There are Veela covens in the world and sometimes a lucky guy gets to visit.
#+end_quote

no mention of covens in canon but it can be assumed that veelas have their own community s similar to giants,vampires,goblins and centaurs

#+begin_quote
  Mastering and tapping into the power of accidental magic is the key to wandless magic.
#+end_quote

We dont know how wandless magic is learned but mastering accidental magic is unlikely because the wandless magic we have seen is normally rather simple compared to accidental magic. Its most likely learned by study and practice like all forms of magic seem to be learned
