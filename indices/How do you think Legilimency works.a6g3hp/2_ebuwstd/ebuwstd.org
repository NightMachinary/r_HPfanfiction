Personally i think most Magical's in harry potter realize how strong and versatile it is.. The most skilled user's have been seen . a comment from Snape on Voldemort was. " Voldemort could not only read, but also control and unhinge the minds of others, with him often enjoying telepathically invading the minds of others, creating incredibly realistic visions designed to torture them into madness "

also this explains how harry got sent the "false visions"
