Ok, but Harry has a special connection to Voldemort. He also doesn't initiate the visions. They just happen. The closest we get to him purposely going into his mind is at the end of DH, and even that can be taken as him simply no longer resisting the connection.

I definitely wouldn't take that as proof he can just go around and perform Legilimency on whoever.
