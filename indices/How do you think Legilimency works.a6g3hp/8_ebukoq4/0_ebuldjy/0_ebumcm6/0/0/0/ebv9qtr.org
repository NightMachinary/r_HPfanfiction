That's debatable.

  Why was it so easy? Because his scar had been burning for hours, yearning to show him Voldemort's thoughts? He closed his eyes on [Hermione's] command, and at once, the screams and bangs and all the discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became distant, as though he stood far, far away from them.

It's sort of implied that he only entered because his scar was yearning for him to for hours. Remember, at this point Harry was employing Occlumency against Voldemort. It seems more likely that he simply stopped employing it and the vision came.

It feels like a stretch to say he knows how to go through someone's mind based only on that, especially when that one moment wasn't him even going through Voldemort's memories, but only looking through his eyes.
