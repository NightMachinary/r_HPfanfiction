For the record, its *Occlumency* and *Legilimency.* The '-mency' part is latin for mind (hence the terms roughly mean to hide and read a mind respectively).

You seem to be mixing this up with the commonly used magical suffix '*-mancy.*' Oddly enough thats, a greek term to, and actually means 'to divine,' rather than a magical catch-all additive to words. Examples from Harry Potter would include Tasseomancy (divine with tea leaves) and Oneiromancy (divine through dreams).
