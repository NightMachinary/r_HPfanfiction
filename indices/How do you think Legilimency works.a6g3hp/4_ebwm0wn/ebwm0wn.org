My favorite depiction is from linkffn(The Changeling). Legilimency allows you to experience someone's thoughts and memories as if you were them, and requires great discipline and emotional detachment to use effectively. Occlumency requires you to be able to tie your thoughts into such a snarl that even you probably can't untie them again. Both are dangerous skills to learn, especially legilimency, since you basically have to entirely stop caring about the target as a person, just as a source of information, in order to read them without getting pulled in and lost.
