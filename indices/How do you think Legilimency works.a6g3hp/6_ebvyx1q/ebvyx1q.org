I liked White Squirrel's interpretation of Occlumency, where it's not really even magic at all, just really good mental discipline. So why not Legilimency as well? I like the idea of it being akin to a Sherlock Scan, since I personally find people easy to read in real life. Magical means of mental infiltration and fortification would just make it easier to do.
