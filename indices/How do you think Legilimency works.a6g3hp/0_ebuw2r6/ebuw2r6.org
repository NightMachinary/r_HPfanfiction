My headcanon:

Legilimency is the art of reaching out to other people's mindsets. On a surface level ("low-level" Legilimency, without casting Legilimens, and requiring eye contact), you get the feel of other people's emotions. For people with no Occlumency shields at all (even "innate" from how their general mindset works) who project all their emotions and thoughts openly, you might grasp images, words, or whatnot that the person is currently considering. This technique is how trained Legilimens figure out lies.

A second level is a direct and deliberate contact, using the Legilimens spell. This gives you access to people's memories, and you can control their train of thought by projecting emotions alongside hints, using people's emotions against them. For example, if you want blackmail material from Harry about his love life, you can use Legilimens, think of various girls he knows until you can suss out affection from his emotions, and then follow that rabbit hole projecting strong affection (presumably from your own SO/whatever) and strong hints towards said girl.

On top of Occlumency, direct Legilimency is also a contest of willpower. Harry made for a terrible Occlumens thorough his adventures, but his will was strong -- he was able to /kind of/ repel Severus at times when he approached memories Harry /really/ didn't want him to see even though he never really got anywhere with Occlumency. One pitfall of direct Legilimency is backfire -- either though Protego (or similar protection spells), or through very overpowering will. Considering that Legilimency relaxes your own Occlumency shields, this can be a major problem. This is the reason Severus used a Pensieve while he (tried to) teach Harry Occlumency.

I also believe that Obliviation is closely connected to Legilimency in how you target things you want people to forget. Thus, skilled Legilimens make a good foundation for a skilled Obliviator. The opposite is also true -- you can't reliably Obliviate people who has mastered Occlumency. This, however, makes Obliviate fatal if it backfires -- it traps you in your own memories as they dissipate, and as you forget them, you're unable to figure out what is happening until everything is wiped clean (Lockhart).

Thus, I think that no, you can't manipulate people with Legilimency /directly/ -- allthough you can obviously do it indirectly by forcing people to relive memories they would rather forget.
