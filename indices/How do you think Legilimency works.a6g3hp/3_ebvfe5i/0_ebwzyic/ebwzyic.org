I don't really think so about this part. If I remember correctly, Harry made Legilimency appear to be similar to muggle mind reading, which is really just reading the at the moment thoughts. However, Legilimency is quite more than that as it does allow you to go into the mind and recall memories, which is significantly different then mind reading imo.
