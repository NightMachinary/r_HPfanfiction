Legilimency clearly works somewhat akin to reading a mind. Snape was just needlessly adversarial and pedantic, because he loves to belittle Harry and make himself seem more complicated and grand (narcissist).

Similarly potions is mostly like cooking, you just follow the recipe (see Hermione and her Polyjuice). Snape just has his head way too deep up his own arse to admit it.

I can't believe how often readers take blatantly unreliable characters like Snape, Bellatrix,Crouch Junior or Dumbledore at their word when doing a surface level analysis of HP.
