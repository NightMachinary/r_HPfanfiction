I can see why a lot of people don't like the "mind palace" fanon, but really we're given little to no explaination on how mind-magics really work in HP, and what we are told is by Snape, a horrible teacher with a hate-boner for Harry, so it's easy ebough to disregard what we are told and make up anything we want.
