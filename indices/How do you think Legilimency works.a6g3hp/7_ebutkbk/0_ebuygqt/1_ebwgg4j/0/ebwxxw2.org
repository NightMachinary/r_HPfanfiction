A mind palace doesn't have to be a giant ass house castle. . . it isn't a literal term but a concept. I'm not saying I'm right, but a mind palace concept isn't exactly what you think it is, and isn't exactly a dumb idea when we have virtually zero information. I was saying that what I imagine is that the mind palace concept is sort of what everyone's mindscape is like.

  The legilimens is not supposed to know that the occlumens is deceiving him otherwise the legilimens would just torture/kill/other shit.

Uh what? Occlumens has more use than when you are captured. Talented Legilimens can perceive your thought without a wand or word, Occlumency would prevent that and would result in anything other than privacy. Just because an Occlumens deceives a Legilimens, doesn't mean they are going to be killed or tortured. If that were the case, advanced Occlumency wouldn't be to fool a Legilimens, that would just be basic Occlumency; which it isn't as Occlumency in the most basic form is to prevent external penetration of the mind. The mind palace doesn't exactly stop that if it isn't know what their mind palace looks like as everyone should theoretically have something different.

Despite that, a "giant ass house castle" with zero defenses wouldn't exactly stop a Legilimens from accessing their thoughts and emotions if the Legilimens can just go into said "giant ass house castle." The Occlumency part would be accessing their own and building defenses for the "giant ass house castle" is how the mind palace concept would work for Legilimency and Occlumency.
