  The way I understood it, from reading the books, was this:

  The legilimencer is suspicious of his victim. Suspicious of something that would be associated with the emotion of guilt or fear (or even happiness). The guilt or fear emotion is tied to a memory. The legilimencer traces the emotion to the memory. He sees the memory and knows why the person is guilty or fearful.

  The occlumencer, in order to evade the legilimency, clears his mind, "emptying himself of emotions" because the emotion is the breadcrumb to the memory. It would probably require a strong will.

    I told you to empty yourself of emotion! ... Fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves, who cannot control their emotions, who wallow in sad memories and allow themselves to be provoked this easily --- weak people, in other words --- they stand no chance against his powers! He will penetrate your mind with absurd ease, Potter! -- Snape, OotP
