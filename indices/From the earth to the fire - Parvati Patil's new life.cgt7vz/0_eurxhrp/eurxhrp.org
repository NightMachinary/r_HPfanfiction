I enjoyed what you've written so far. In the section where she ends up in Myrtle's bathroom, it's not entirely clear from how it's written why she ends up going there because she couldn't make it all the way back to Gryffindor tower rather than using whatever's closest. Anxiety over how girls in other houses would react if they found out she was trans?
