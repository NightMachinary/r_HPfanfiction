You're right I didn't, but could you be any more rude? There was no reason to reply that way. I was under the impression that unless it broke a rule I could post about it. Basically whatever the fuck I want.

And for your information, not that I need to justify anything to you, I wanted other peoples favorites. I like to read fics that other people love... to hear their reasons why it's their fav...

Be kind to ppl, man. It comes back on you when you don't.
