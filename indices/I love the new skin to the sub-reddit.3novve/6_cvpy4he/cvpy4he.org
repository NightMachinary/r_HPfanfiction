Glad you like it! I thought it was time for a change, especially since [[/r/harrypotter]] went all-in.

If anyone finds any bugs, feel free to tell me. This is actually my first time working with CSS (like, ever), and I've basically hacked together many open-source existing themes and added some of my own touches, so I hope you like it!

*Current Bugs (Fix ETA is this weekend)*

- Upvote/Downvote arrows reversed (simple fix)

- "/Nox/" animation doesn't play when downvoting comments (relatively simple fix)

- Selftext image doesn't appear next to links (minor issue, but a bit more involved due to the hack-y nature of this CSS stylesheet)
