And honestly, i have no idea what haft of that on the picture is supposed to show. Who it the guy getting hit by the red spell right next to voldy? Why it the witch that is having Prior Incantatem with voldy? Who is Bellatrix(?) blasting with green, and who is the girl crawling just beside him. What white bird spell is shot at the guy behind Bellatrix. Is that a goat head i see inside the explosion on the left? Why the dragons? Is that Luna in the stribed shit under the red spell? What is standing right under/next to Luna? Why is there a disembodied face under voldys hand? Why is Molly just standing there? Why is there a fire inside the window, and only there, and on the topic of fire, how does the stone above the Weasley burn? What Weasley is that? And finally, why do Hagrid(?) have a three eyed skull on his pants, and what spell is the trying to do? Patronus? Lumos?
