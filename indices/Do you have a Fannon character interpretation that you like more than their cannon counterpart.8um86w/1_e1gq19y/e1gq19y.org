Voldemort. Canon Voldemort falls into the stereotypical bad guy that somehow manages to do stupid things to somehow botch an easy victory. Fanon lets us see some truly incredible Voldemort's from POTDK to the Firebird Trilogy or even LDS. Those characterizations aren't necessarily consistent but they give more depth to a character that sorely needs it.

I especially like the Firebird Trilogy that has him become a /Dark Lord/ for reasons other than "muh power" or "eviiiilll". I think canon does him (and the Death Eaters) a disservice by making them just another group of baddies. Villains don't have to be pure evil and it is much more interesting to have them be on the edge of evil rather than satan incarnate.

Mindless casting of the cruciatus and endless killing curses are a great example of fanon (and to some extent canon) butchering his character. Voldemort is ambitious, cunning, and has a thirst for power. His characterization has to reflect that. Furthermore *Voldemort is not pure evil.* Voldemort doesn't do bad things for the sake of them, but rather to pursue greater power. This is in my mind a very important distinction. Motivation is just as important as the actions as themselves.
