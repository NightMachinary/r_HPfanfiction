The Death Eaters in Lady Archimedes. Some of them are really fucking scary in that fic, compared to canon (and definetly compared to the grimderp bad guys in Squirrel's other epic sequel, Animagus at War).

Ginny in Not From Others and GW&HBP. Not that canon Ginny wasn't spunky, but she definitely lacked screen time in canon (although it's implied that she spent most of Summer of 1996 in the company of our three favourite Gryffindors, so it's not like they barely knew each other).
