Tom Riddle and the Death Eaters in Reign of the Serpent. Honestly, most characters in Rein of the Serpent except Harry and Hermione. They aren't bad at all, but I don't particularly like them better than other representations of them. I also really like Sirius and Quirrel in this story as well. linkffn(9783012)
