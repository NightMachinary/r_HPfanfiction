I tried getting into A Black Bound but something about it was very off-putting. Maybe it was the tedious word count or how Aquila was such a cliche character. But you're right, I did like the Sirius in there. Same thing for Son of Potter, Daughter of Black. However, I will give the third one a shot, so thanks! =)
