Well, its a dimension travel fic where both worlds are important, and they somewhat interact between each one. Its a bit angsty heavy, but nothing too horrible or graphic. There's a bunch of worse fics out there, angsty-wise. Just be prepared for a more immature emotionally Harry than usual. Not saying he's throwing tantrums, but he is somewhat bad at understanding what he feels and what to do to make it better.
