The Sirius from Black Bond, where the trauma of both the AU world (he thought his wife and daughter died because he went after the rat instead of protecting them. The wife did die, but not the daughter) and Azkaban was well done and you can really relate to him and how he behaves later on around both Harry and Acquila (his daughter, obviously).

I like the one from "Son of Potter, Daughter of Black" too, basically same reasons as Black bond, minus the AU part.

But probably the one I like the most is the one from "Too far from home" mostly because there's 2 of him and they're both so different because of their pasts but also stay true to his core personality.
