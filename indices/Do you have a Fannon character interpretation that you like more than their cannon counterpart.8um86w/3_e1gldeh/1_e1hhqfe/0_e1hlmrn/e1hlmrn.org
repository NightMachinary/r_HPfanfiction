Or, you know, didn't try to contact his best friend's son, the only link he thought was left to those friends you were talking about, for 11 years.

Remus is not bad for not standing up to his friends, but he is weak for it. Hermione had no problem standing up to Ron and Harry in 3rd year because she thought it was the best thing for them. Neville stood up to them in 1st year. Good friends will tell each other when they are being stupid. So either he was too weak and afraid to challenge them, or he condoned it. But honestly, that's not even the reason I dislike him.

I'm sorry, but defending the 'I'm ready to abandon both my wife and newborn child' is kind of ludicrous. The only reason he went back was because Harry wouldn't let him come. He would have actually abandoned them if Harry had let him. It wasn't like Remus changed his mind voluntarily. I would have been fine if Harry had said yes and then Remus changed his mind.

Mind you, the Lupins were both stupid enough to get killed in the same place. At least one of them should have stayed behind for their son.
