What makes Remus a terrible character?

Was it the fact that he never stood up against the bullying done by the only friends he'd ever known, and the only friends he had who accepted his furry little problem? He owes everything to them. Standing up against them and possibly losing his friends would have been his worst nightmare. Something he would later go through. Twice. Once in 1981 when he woke up to find James, Lily, and Peter dead, and Sirius in jail, and again when Sirius went through the veil.

Or was he kind of terrible because he was super freaked out about becoming a dad and possibly passing down a terrible curse onto his innocent child? All he needed was Harry telling him, "shut the fuck up and go be with your wife" and he was good.

He is certainly a flawed character, and he's no hero, but a terrible person? I don't see it.
