Problem is, we know next to nothing about metamorphs and are never introduced to another for comparison. So it could be that or it could just be Tonks.

You have to remember that this IS magic, so who is to say that another metamorph might not be just fine? Maybe magic does balance out the senses when they shift and tonks would normally be fatally clumsy without it lol.
