Whilst I don't disagree with you on the use of Tonks, I think the clumsy makes sense in context. If someone's body was constantly shifting in proportion, size, and weight, it stands to reason that you wouldn't consciously know where in space your body was, since the shifting seems to be unconscious as well. When she consciously shifts, it might be easier to actively control where the body exists in space, so it's easier to avoid detection, but that would take some serious concentration, since shifting is so easy to do by accident.
