I tend to like Tonks in most fics where she is more than a background character.

In canon: New Auror with metamorph powers and is dead clumsy (somehow got into the equivalent of the FBI), turns into a weird love interest for someone twice her age. Dies off screen.

In fanon: A well trained Auror, student of Mad-Eye, with metamorph powers and only somewhat clumsy. Funny, smart, and generally able to put Harry and co on their asses in a duel because an Auror should be able to woop on some teenagers.

Mostly, I felt like she was a wasted character, and Remus is kind of a terrible person so I didn't like the pairing.
