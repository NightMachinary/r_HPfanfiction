Hedwig.

*Canon*: basically a symbol of Harry's connection to the Wizarding world, then an avatar of his anger, finally treated like an action figure accessory in the Battle of Seven Potters, where she is stuck in a cage during an AERIAL battle, until murdered. At least in the movies they had the good sense to allow her to actively sacrifice her life for Harry.

*Fanon*: when included, she has a subtle humour and critical attitude, sometimes edging toward R2-D2 levels of competence and utility. Fanfiction makes her a symbol of familial care and oversight, rather than just a special effect.
