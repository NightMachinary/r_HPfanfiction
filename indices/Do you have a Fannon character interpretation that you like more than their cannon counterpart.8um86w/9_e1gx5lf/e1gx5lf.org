Blaise Zabini as written in Turn. Holy crap what a hilarious and quirky guy. He is also fascinating in Secrets (Vorabiza) and in that Truth one where they all go to the pub.

Basically, I like weird as fuck Blaise.

I'm also a fan of jock/jokester/amazing Ginny. She is an excellent character when written well.
