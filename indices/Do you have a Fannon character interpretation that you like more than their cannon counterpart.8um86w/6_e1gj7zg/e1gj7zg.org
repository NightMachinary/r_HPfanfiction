This question would be a lot easier to answer if the book canon characterisations were consistent. For example, in OotP, both Ginny and Tonks are BAMFs, yet in HBP they are a rather mindless love interest and a mopey pushover respectively. I'd love to read fanfics where the fifth year Ginny grows up some more and ends up with Harry, yet most Hinny fics portray them as a boring couple or generic cop&sports start (or are your average, cringeworthy OP!Harry fare).

On the other end of the spectrum, you have Snape, who basically fucked up an entire generation by depriving them of qualified potioneers, held grudges against children over people who died a decade ago and willingly joined the magical SS equivalent and yet apparently is a hero, because, well, uhm, he wanted some redheaded ass? Because that makes being a magical Nazi and a criminally abusive teacher ok?
