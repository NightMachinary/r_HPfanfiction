Sorry, I'm tired. What I mean is that just because you did a good thing that doesn't mean that the bad thing you did is forgotten or forgiven.

For example, if Superman threw a comet at the earth and, when all hope seems lost, stop it, that doesn't mean that he shouldn't be held accountable for throwing the comet in the first place.

Or, if you prefer another example: a fireman that is always the first in the crumbling and burning buildings, saving the most people he possibly can before the heat and the smoke become too much. Do these heroic acts mean that he can wring the neck of puppies with impunity?
