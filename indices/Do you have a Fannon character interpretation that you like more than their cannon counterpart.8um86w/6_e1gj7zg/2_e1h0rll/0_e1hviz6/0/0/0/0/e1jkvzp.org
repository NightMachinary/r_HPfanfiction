I understand what you are saying but I can't accept it. Not when you are saying that what Snape did erased all of his previous actions. This is just a fool's hope, a childish point of view, to consider that you are only held accountable for your latest action, erasing whatever you did or didn't do previously.

If Snape would have survived and Nuremberg style trials held, regardless of the final verdict it would have been examined whether or not the good he made by switching side outweigh the actions he took while on the DE side.

.

Also, just because one of the victims say "I forgive you", that doesn't mean that they don't want them to go in jail. Or that the other victims share that point of view. It happens that a victim forgive the criminal for a crime, because they understand and have compassion/pity for the circumstances that lead to said crime but that doesn't mean that the criminal is allowed to walk away scot free. At most it would result in a sentence reduction, not a medal.
