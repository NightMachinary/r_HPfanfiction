this is irrelevant to the point about what makes him heroic, i.e. being heroic, not whatever hellstrike says. the core of a redemption arc is a rejection and reformation of your past wrongdoing. snape has rejected his past DE affiliations and repented. he already was exonerated, by the law. he was also forgiven, by harry

we're talking about snape's character, you're talking about how you /want/ people to respond to him

this is why your 'Two rights do not right a wrong.' is incoherent. insofar as a wrong can be righted, a right does right a wrong. it's only if you think a wrong can never be righted that that would make that make any sense
