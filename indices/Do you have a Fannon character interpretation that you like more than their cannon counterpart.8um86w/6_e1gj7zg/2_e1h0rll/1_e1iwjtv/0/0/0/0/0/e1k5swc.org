  He became someone who could not forgive a child for surviving when his mother
#+end_quote

most of this is your baseless headcanon. snape doesn't resent harry for lily not surviving, he wants harry to survive. he just can't help projecting james onto him and thus hating him

#+begin_quote
  His reasons for switching sides were selfish, what he did after switching likewise
#+end_quote

what he did after switching was risk his life to defeat the DEs and save others, in his own words

#+begin_quote
  we do not know how much he did because he chose to and how much because he did not want to go against Dumbledore
#+end_quote

again, baseless headcanon. when snape doesn't want to do something, he doesn't do it. like when dumbledore ordered him to teach harry occlumency but he stopped because harry annoyed him, or when dumbledore told him to help lupin and he did the exact opposite, or when he threatened to renege on their deal to kill dumbledore until he told him more information. snape goes against dumbledore all the time
