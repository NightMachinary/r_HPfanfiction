Draco in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12088294/1/Animagus-at-War][Animagus at War]], linkffn(12088294): His redemption arc is a lot more convincing than in canon. He is actually thinking. Even his pranks against Harry are well played.

Dumbledore in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877). He's totally manipulative and ruthless, but only against the bad guys.

Ginny in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]], linkffn(6919395): Her growth in this story is phenomenal. I like this version of her a lot better than Canon.

Harry in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): He becomes increasingly brutal as the story goes on, and yet he remains fiercely protective of his friends. When he and Hermione are going on that suicide mission in the end, he 'orders' Neville to stay behind.

Hermione in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): I have my greatest sympathy and respect for this Hermione, I wish she and Harry could get together in their new world.

Ron in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: Now, that's a role model for a fun and loyal friend.

Voldemort in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542): Dumbledore is on top of his game, Harry is training hard, Lockhart is not a fraud, Fudge and his Ministry are reasonable, even Pansy is redeeming herself. But all that would not be enough, if Hermione and Aberforth has not picked up the slack. This Voldemort is brilliant and scary. No, canon Horcrux hunt would have never worked.
