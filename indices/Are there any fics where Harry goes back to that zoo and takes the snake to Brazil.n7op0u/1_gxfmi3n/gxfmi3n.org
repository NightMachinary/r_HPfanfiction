I used to have one where the snake became Harry's familiar and they escaped together and tried to go to Brazil, only to be interrupted by Harry's letter, but I'm disappointed by my original (old terrible fic) and while my rewrite is better, I only have three chapters so far and haven't updated in a long time. I might continue it at some point, but have been busy with another fic.
