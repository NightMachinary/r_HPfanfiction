Thanks, I'm going to give The Bodacious Bodyguard a shot later. However, Grains of Sand was a letdown. It might be a bit spoilery, but Tonks still lets Harry go to the Department of mysteries. The fic might as well start at chapter 9. Up to that point, it's just a Year 5 rehash with Tonks as a student and friend of Harry's.
