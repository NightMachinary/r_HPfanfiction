It is a nice pairing, though it can be done very badly. I've noped out of several fics where Tonks goes to "rescue" Harry at the start of the Order of the Phoenix only to "seduce" him. And by "seduce" read "molest" him. I know it's a double standard so some people think it's okay, but come on. Start the story when Harry is at least a bit older.

Okay, this one also has Fleur in it and is mostly smut. But I found the idea to be really funny and it's entertaining to read.
