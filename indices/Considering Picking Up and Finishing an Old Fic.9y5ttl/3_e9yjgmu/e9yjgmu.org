When I write, I tend to already have a basic outline in mind. I don't formally outline or anything, but I know where the story is headed and I think about that end before writing each chapter. Having said that, the two longer stories I have I took a long break in the middle because I got bored, so I had to step back for while until I felt ready to continue them. When I did pick them back up again, I first went through and edited previous chapters (mostly for grammar but also to tighten up and even out the quality) which helped me re-engage in the plot. It's great to read your old work and realize 'this doesn't totally suck!'

As a reader, I encourage you to finish the old fic - even if you are planning to redo parts of it, completed long stories are a heaven sent.
