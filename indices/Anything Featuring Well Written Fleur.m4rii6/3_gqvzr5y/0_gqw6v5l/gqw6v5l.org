I don't mind femlash at all.

When I say sexualised I don't mean literal sex scenes, but the way she's never a character in her own right beyond beauty. When she isn't treated as comedy relief, she's a status symbol, the same way that 99% of fics where Harry's the descendant of Salazar Slytherin it isn't because it's a cool concept, but to make it clear to readers just how badass he is. I'm yet to see a FleurxHarry fic written the same way as a harmony or even hinny fic.
