I enjoyed US house of cards but I admit I feel the UK one worked far better. When is UK house of cards set? I haven't seen it in a while but I have an idea Urquhart takes over from Thatcher? In which case he would indeed be the PM Fudge talks to instead of Major. So late 1980's though the 1990's. Full disclosure I'm in my mid twenties I wasn't born when this show came out.

I am loving your characterisation of Francis Urquhart btw have an upvote.
