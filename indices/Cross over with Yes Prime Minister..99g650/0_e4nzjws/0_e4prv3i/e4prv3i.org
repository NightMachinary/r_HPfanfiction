They were all very short fics. I was hoping for a longer fic. Maybe the interactions between Fudge and the Prime Minister at the time, who I think we all assume is John Major but with Jim Hacker instead of Major. Or a whole fic about Jim Hacker freaking out. You know how in the first episode he realises he can start a nuclear war and then freaks out? Maybe something like that but with him being freaked out by the fact magic is real instead.

Also Bernard would be a wizard. I don't know why but that makes sense to me.
