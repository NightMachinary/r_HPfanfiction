It's incomplete, but "A Marauder's Plan" by CatsAreCool - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan]] is excellent. (Incomplete, but updated fairly regularly)

Muggledad has a variety of novel-length H/Hr fics, if those are your thing. Bobmin (mentioned below for Sunset Over Britain and on ff.net here - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/777540/Bobmin356]]) has some more recent stuff that is also fun.
