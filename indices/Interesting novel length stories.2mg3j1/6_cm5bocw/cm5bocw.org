Incomplete, but one of my all time favorite HP crossover fics (with Star Wars, but no canon knowledge necessary) that veers heavily into the awesome action and clever side of things: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force]]

Business, by the legendary esama: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113588]] (Harry saves the world by being a damn good businessman)

Or anything by Celebony on FFnet, who is a master at doing family feels, with special mention going to "Family Night" for being the most beautiful, moving fic ever that managed to actually make me hate Remus: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2682144/1/Family-Night]]

Also a great crossover: Cardcaptor Harry, by LunaStorm on FFNet, for great writing and pulling up all the beautiful things I liked about Cardcaptors: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7845282/1/Cardcaptor-Harry]]
