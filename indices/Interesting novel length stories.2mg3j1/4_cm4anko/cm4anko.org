[[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunset over Britain]] by Bobmin356 is really good. Very early stuff, written about 2005. It also as a sequel, both are insanely long. It will last you way more than a few days, depending on how fast you read! One thing that's always been fun about their early stuff is that they were early on enough before somethings became annoyingly tropey. Really any of their stuff is good. (I say their because they are a husband and wife writing team)
