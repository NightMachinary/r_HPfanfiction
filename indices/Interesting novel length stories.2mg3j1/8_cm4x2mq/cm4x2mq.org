I have the quirk of only reading stories with fully original main characters who are unrelated to any notable character in the books. Recently I was recommended to the Anguis series, by Slide, which is about 4 Slytherin students one year older than Harry. There are 3 stories on fanfiction.net.

Latet Anguis in Herba

Shade to Shade

Falls the Shadow

I picked it up 3 days ago and I'm already almost done with Shade to Shade. It has blown my mind several times already. The 4 main characters are all interesting in their own way, the pace is good, the story is packed with action, and it's sufficiently dark and gritty for me to enjoy while still having that Hogwartsy charm. I definitely recommend it.
