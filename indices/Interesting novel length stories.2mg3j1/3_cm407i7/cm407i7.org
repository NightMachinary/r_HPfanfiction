Lasting a few days is a pretty epic undertaking. There aren't many fics that are long enough to meet that requirement.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] is the obvious reply as it comes in at 1.2 million words. I personally have a few issues with it, but it's extremely readable. The fic isn't yet finished, but she's still updating it and we're almost there, now mid-way through 7th year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2954601/1/Taking-Control][Taking Control]] is a Harry/Ginny post-OotP fic with training!Harry. I read it years ago so I don't know how I'd feel about it now, but I remember it being ok. 520k words.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/A-Stranger-in-an-Unholy-Land][Stranger in an Unholy Land]] is 470k words. It has a bit of a rocky start and you may be tempted to give up on it, but the quality goes up a lot.

Finally, something a bit out of left-field: a Star Wars fanfic author. I normally wouldn't recommend something not-HP here, but it fits your epicness requirement so well that I thought I might as well: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1584073/blank101][blank101]]. This author has a Star Wars trilogy where Luke is caught by the Empire during A New Hope and taken to Coruscant. He also has a stand-along Star Wars fic of 378k words which features a Luke raised as an Emperor's Hand. Both are amazing.
