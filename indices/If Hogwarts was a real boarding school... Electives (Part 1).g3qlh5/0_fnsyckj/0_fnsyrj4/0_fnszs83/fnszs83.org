Ah, okay. I didn't know they used Semester in Australia too.

It's just that electives are waaaay less of a thing in England than people's interpretation of Harry Potter sometimes suggest. eg. At my secondary school, we had eight core subjects and only got to choose three 'electives' for our GCSE, and my A-Level College had no electives, just core modules for the A-Level and about a dozen clubs (film club, science club, art club, etc), for example. Adding too many does risk falling into the 'class credits' system the Americans have.
