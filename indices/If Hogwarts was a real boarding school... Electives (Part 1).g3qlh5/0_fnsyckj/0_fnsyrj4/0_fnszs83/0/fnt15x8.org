I think that a lot of schools have more Core subjects than are offered at Hogwarts, and a bunch of others have electives within the Core units. For example, One of Eton's blocks requires students to study English, maths and then one or two selected from a bunch in a particular category e.g. 1 or 2 modern language from a selection, 2 of three choices of science, 1 of a selection of 'creative' subjects etc.

A lot of schools bundle electives into blocks so students will have core classes and then three blocks to choose electives from.

I like to imagine that the wizarding world functions primarily in a guild mastery sort of system and Hogwarts Upper classes would provide students with the opportunity to have foundation knowledge in these areas...
