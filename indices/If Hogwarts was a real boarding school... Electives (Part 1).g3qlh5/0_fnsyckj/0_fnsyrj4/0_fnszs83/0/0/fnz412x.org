That was kind of what I was trying to say. You'd have certain absolute core subjects you needed (ie. the magical version of the STEM classes), then some core classes you could vary up (eg. the magical version of a single 'Science Class' vs three separate classes in 'Chemistry, Physics, and Biology'), and then three blocks of electives.

And to the best of my knowledge - though I admit it's been awhile since I looked at primary sources, just my notes made for making guilds in D&D games - a Guild Mastery system in traditional England was sort of a mix of our modern Apprenticeship system (young untrained learns from institutional-knowledge-having and experienced older teacher) and the Degree/Doctoral-exam system in certain subjects where you have to create something semi-original to prove your knowledge (eg. for my psych bachelor's degree, I had to create and run my own original study). You'd get trained on the job as an apprentice, then once your teacher felt you were able to work on your own/had learned everything they could teach you, they'd make you prove it with a test and if it was good they'd make you a journeyman, then you'd have to create something Original to become a Master.

I'd recommend you maybe make a thread asking whether your system would work/be Brit-pickedly appropriate first, otherwise you're just coming up with a lot of ideas that you might not end up using. And I know there are actual teachers from England here in the sub, so you'd get better answers on that than I could provide having only been a student and assistant lab tech.
