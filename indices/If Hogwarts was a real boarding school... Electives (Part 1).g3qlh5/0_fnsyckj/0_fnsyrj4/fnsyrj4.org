Nope! I am from a state in Australia where there are 4 terms which are organised into 2 semesters. They often do handover of the electives at the end of the semester. The books seemed to have two teaching periods separated by a holiday break at around christmas, so I used semester as its the term I am most familiar with.

I actually don't have any familiarity with American schools or curricula.
