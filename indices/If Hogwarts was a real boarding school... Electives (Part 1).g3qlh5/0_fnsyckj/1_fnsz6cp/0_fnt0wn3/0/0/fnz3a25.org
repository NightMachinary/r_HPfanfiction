Ah, okay. My apologies for the misinterpretation. Well, I think you've got a good range to start with - I'd maybe check out other magic systems for more ideas of what Rowling's rather lax system and even more lax details doesn't cover.

I'd probably add something about foreign magics (World Magics, maybe?) to teach how they do things in other cultures. Could link in a bit of geography and sociology there too.

Personally, I'd have a separate Runes class for practical application while Ancient Runes is just languages - given how intensive an actual living-language course can be, learning a set of dead languages would be waaaay more difficult, especially for someone who speaks a language where Fish and Ghoti can be pronounced the same.

Probably some kind of coding/chaining class where students work to put spells together to make new effects (eg. Wingardium Leviosa plus Lumos = Floaty Light).

I'd add in a 'theoretical/esoteric magic' class where students examine new ideas and unusual stuff.

Definitely some kind of physical education class - one sport with eight players is not enough to keep a whole school healthy, no matter how many stairs the place has. :D
