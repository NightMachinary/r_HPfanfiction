[[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunset over Britain]] and the sequel [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunrise_Over_Britain/index/][Sunrise over Britain]]

Both are very long and very good. Has a pretty over powered Harry, but they set out to make him overpowered for the sake of the story, and still involve the struggle of hiding such powers and controlling them, while also dealing political machinations and the War. Pretty fantastic, Bobmin usually do good work. It is some of their early stuff it was plotted out shortly before HBP came out. It does start out a bit fluffy but does get beter and more complex. One of the things to know about Bobmin is they do enjoy playing with Characters and doing different things with them. At this point in time they were not Harmony shippers and wrote a fic to be different than there other things. They also usually dont Molly/Ron/Dumbles bash but did so in this one. Still enjoyable though and a fic I can reread
