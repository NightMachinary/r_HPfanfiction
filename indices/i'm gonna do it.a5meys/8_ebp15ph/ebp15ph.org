- Figure out your beginning, middle and ending of the story.

- For your first fic It's best to go with somthing that is smaller in scope (i.e not a rewrite of all 7 of Harry's years)

- Some people write best by making detailed notes and outlining everything before writing it. Others just write and go with the flow. Figure out which method makes you more comfortable (obviously a small amount of outlining always helps)

- The characters should carry the plot forward, unless you're going for a murder-mystery or something like a horror story.
