It's okay to suck. Just write.

Then rewrite.

write again.

In art, you make a noodly thumbnail sketch to get the composition right.

- Then you do a rough sketch.
- Maybe then you do another
- Maybe there are a few more as you figure out how you want things to fit together.
- Then you start drawing.
- then you adjust that drawing a few dozen times as your'e working: move that arm a bit, twist the hand a little, move the eye to the left.
- When you ink, you might go through all this over again.\\
- You might color the whole picture three times before it's done
- and even then: you could work on it more.
- Just, it's time to stop.

And this is what writing can be like too.

Sometimes the hardest part can be to GET THE FUCKING WORDS out. So just.. GET them out, even if they're awful. Do the verbal equivalent of drawing an oval and writing SANDWICH on it.

Write shit like this:

#+begin_quote
  She blushed heatedly at his rakish grin, the sapphire of his eyes gleaming in amusement at her embarrassment. After a moment, she found herself spitting out a kinda lame retort before he fires a real zinger back at her and she stomps away angrily, furious at his.. his ARROGANCE! That prat! How dare he say whatever it was he said! The door slammed so hard that the common room went silent for a moment, other than the crackle of the fire.
#+end_quote

It's okay to be uneven.

Come back and fix it later. Establish the important stuff: They're arguing, she's flustered, he gets the better of her, verbally, she stomps off to the common room. it's a sketch. Details later. If you have details now, that's great, but if all you can do is type INSERT INSULT HERE for now, that is OKAY.

Sketch. rework it as you go. Don't be afraid to throw parts of it out.
