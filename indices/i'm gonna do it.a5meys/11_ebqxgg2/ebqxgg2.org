okay so I'll admit it im a crackfic addict and I write hella crack sometimes so what I usually do is thus:\\
- come up with a really dumb premise or specific thing you want to happen\\
- figure out what the base change(s) would have to be for that to happen, throw in some adjectives on the other characters because you need them to be /something/\\
- write a few skits about it\\
- come up with a minor plot to connect the skits\\
- actually write the whole thing
