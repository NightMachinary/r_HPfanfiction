I agree with what wordhammer has said. Instead of making a new post, I will just piggyback from them and call it a day.

You should always plot the ending before you start to write as the ending is, in all sense, the end game. It should be set, but not set in stone. Be prepared to change it slightly, even rewrite it completely, but remain as close to the first draft as you can (within reason). I say this because some fanfiction tends to falloff towards the end. If you start it early, you have a less chance of that happening. All fanfics I have started I have written the end first.

Another thing I do is I treat characters like I would if I was roleplaying. Their story unveils throughout the story and nothing (except for things relating to the end) is planned. This may not work for everyone, but it helps me keep interactions pure and unexpected. In essence, interactions change them and morph them.

In one story, I had this spur of the moment idea to introduce someone who attacked a setting. The main character was wounded and, due to this, started to be a little more paranoid. It was fully unexpected because not even I expected it.

I have most likely confused you more, but you know, it just happens.
