I highly recommend getting a beta. A beta is someone who will read through your fic and hopefully fix not only grammar and spelling mistakes but also give good, useful feedback on your idea in general, pacing, etc.

Fanfiction.net has a beta search function (you basically have to write a few messages to people and eventually someone will respond) or you can find one on here or at [[/r/fanfiction]] , a more general sub that is actually smaller than this community.

It makes an enormous difference to reading quality, and at least in my case also avoided awkward conversations with family or friends.
