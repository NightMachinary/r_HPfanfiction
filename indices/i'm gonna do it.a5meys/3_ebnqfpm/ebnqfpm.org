When I write, I have one thing that I want most to write, something that resonates with me. It might be a chapter, a scene, a moment or even a turn of phrase. One true thing, or feeling.

I find that once you have that . . . Lodestone, that grounding, to set the tone and sort of . . . Guide your fic, the rest is a bit easier.

Good luck.
