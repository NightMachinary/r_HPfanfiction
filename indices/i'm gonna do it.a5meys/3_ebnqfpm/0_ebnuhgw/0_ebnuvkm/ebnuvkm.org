That's a hilarious image, but that's definitely how it feels sometimes! Not like I'm creating something, but like I'm uncovering something that has always existed and I'm just trying to translate or describe what I find.

I've got another little needlepoint that I'm struggling with: Draco, opening a Weasley sweater. Black, with tiny white points all across in the shape of the constellation. He's very grateful. No one, in his whole life, has ever made something for him.

Why did he get it? How? Draco/Ginny, or something else? What's his relationship with Ron like? Harry? Lucius?

No idea, but I can't wait to find out! The wilderness mist be explored! Caw caw roar!
