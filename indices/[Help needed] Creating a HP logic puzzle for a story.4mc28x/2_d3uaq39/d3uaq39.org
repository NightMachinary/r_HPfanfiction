  I'm currently writing a story and I find myself in need of creating a logic puzzle - without being too specific, I was contemplating something along the same sort of lines as Snape's logic puzzle in the Philosophers/Sorcerers stone.

  But at the same time without completely copying it.

I don't know how good or bad an idea this is, but maybe do the potions puzzle but make it uniquely solvable with the information available to the reader? I've never quite forgiven JKR for providing insufficient information to solve it along with Hermione.
