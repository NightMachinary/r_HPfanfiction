No Slytherin, and very little "romance" but it is literally my favorite Dark!Harry around: linkffn(Lesser Evils by Scott Press). Yes, the beginning is rough. Yes, the main characters aren't super likable (part of the point). But no one in the fandom understands the Dark Arts and those who use them like Scott Press.
