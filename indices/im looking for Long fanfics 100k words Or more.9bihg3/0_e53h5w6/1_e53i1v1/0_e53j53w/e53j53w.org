I organize my FFN app into 'Crack Fics', 'Low Quality', 'Completed','Currently Updating','Abandoned', and 'Crossover'. I don't have a specific folder for them but...

I would call my FFN Favorites list as my high quality folder of sorts; I only have 45 stories on there and each of them brings something exceptional to the fandom or is of the highest quality. I obviously personally vouch for each and every one of them.
