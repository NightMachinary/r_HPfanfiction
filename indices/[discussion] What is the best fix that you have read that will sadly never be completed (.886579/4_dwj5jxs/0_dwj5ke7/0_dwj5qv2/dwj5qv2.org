This one really bummed me out. I'd been following the writings of bob & alyx since their first fic. I know they were a tough personality to deal with in the HP community, & almost they single-handedly killed fanficauthors.net, but the sunrise/sunset series is still to this day some of my favorite fic to re-read.
