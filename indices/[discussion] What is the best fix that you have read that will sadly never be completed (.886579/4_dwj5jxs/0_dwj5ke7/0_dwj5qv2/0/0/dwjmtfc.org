The story behind FFA.net was that all the authors had to unanimously agree before admitting an additional author to post on the site. From my understanding, Bob/Alyx vetoed almost all the authors that applied, so as not to upstage their own stories, which were at the time generating most of the traffic for the site. This cause author applications to drop to nil overtime & this caused traffic to drop. Ironically, the drop in traffic caused a reduction in exposure for “Bobmin”, leading them to swallow their pride & go back to ff.net, leaving ffa.net to die with only a couple of authors still posting.
