As far as I know she has never finished anything longer than several chapters. So yeah C'est la vie is never getting finished.

It's probably not getting updated again either, since she has dozens of fics that are similarly abandoned. Also she appears to currently be mostly writing in some other fandom called Teen Wolf I've never heard of, so HP works probably aren't a priority.
