[[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3meO7obwCb4X1NaSHNra3BjcUU][A Winter's Fairytale]] is among the best SS/HG stories written in my opinion, and very worth the read despite the fact that it's been abandoned.

The characters are so well-written with convincing personalities and realistic flaws that make them so relatable and sympathetic. I've also never laughed so hard while reading - the humor is smart and true to life.

The plot is absorbing and unique - it starts out as a version of The Hollow Man, and then hints at a murder mystery that we infuriatingly never get the conclusion to!

It was written well before the series was completed, so it's post-war AU. Give it a shot! It won't disappoint.
