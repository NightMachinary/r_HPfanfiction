These have already been mentioned, but The Boy Who Live by Santi and everything written by cywscross that I've read are probably my top ones.

After that *What You Leave Behind* by newcomb. linkffn(10758358)

And *Electric Heart*

[[http://silencia20.tumblr.com/post/164724376152/electric-heart-ch-1]]

In fact most of silencia20's work would qualify, since if you graph how many fics she has, plus how often she starts new fics times how many chapters I expect them to need to be to finish on average vs time, and her completed chapters plus her rate of producing new chapters vs time, and the two lines never converge.

Some other ones

*Multicolour Post Its*

*Rectifier* and *Empathetic*, these are basically the same idea, started then abandoned by two different authors

And *Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past*. It hasn't aged that gracefully, but I still think it deserves a mention, as its like the OG never will be completed fic.
