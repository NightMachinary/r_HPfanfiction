You also have to keep in account of Double Potions as well, which Double means longer, so that'd be two hours as well.

It wouldn't surprise me if some other Professors also had Double, but Harry never made mention of it, since he liked those Professors.

Though it would be just like Snape to make Double Potions because he'd think that they were all inadequate, that they'd need an extra hour on it.

There's also Quidditch to think of as well, how do the students find the time to go to class,do homework, and play Quidditch, that's a lot of work.
