36 hours a week is too much for teaching, especially considering teachers have quite a lot of responsibilities outside the classroom. I guess 24 would probably be fine.

However, if you only have the 5 subjects (later 7 with the electives), and they only meet for one hour (including break), I'd expect most of them to meet 3-4 times a week, or you'll end up with 2 one hour periods a day.
