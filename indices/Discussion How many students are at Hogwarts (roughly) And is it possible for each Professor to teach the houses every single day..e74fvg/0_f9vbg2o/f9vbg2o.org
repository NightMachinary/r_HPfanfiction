Let's assume that the 'core' subject professors always teach 2 houses together for the first 5 years, then the NEWT classes are small enough that they can teach all 4 houses together. If their class meets once a week, that's (5*2+2)=12 classes a week, 24 classes a week if they meet twice a week, 36 if 3 times a week. That seems doable if classes are 1 hour long, since iirc, in canon, most classes meet once or twice a week.

There's 40 students in Harry's year, so if that's the average amount of students per year, that's 20 students per class, a reasonable amount.

Scheduling all that so there aren't overlaps would be super complicated, but presumably there's some magic way of doing that.
