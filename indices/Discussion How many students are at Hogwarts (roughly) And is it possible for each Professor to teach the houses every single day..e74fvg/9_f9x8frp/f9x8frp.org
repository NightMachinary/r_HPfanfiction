In canon, Hogwarts is fairly empty for its size - it's not quite clear how big the student population is, because JKR is terrible with numbers. You could probably make an argument anywhere from 300-1000 students from canon, though I'd trend towards the lower end with how small the houses and classes are described day to day. It seems.possible with how the students are organized that all classes can be taught by the professors.

I personally like the idea of a larger Hogwarts - and introducing junior professors to fill in gaps, making it partly function as a university.
