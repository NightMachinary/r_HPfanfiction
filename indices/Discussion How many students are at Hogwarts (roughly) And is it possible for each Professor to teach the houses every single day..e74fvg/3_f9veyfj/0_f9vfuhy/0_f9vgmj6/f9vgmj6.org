We don't know enough about the period before the first war. Or more specific the Maraunders era. I think it is safe to assume there were more teacher back then tho. Because we know at least at the time Minerva starts teaching there were enough teachers to have department heads.

As for after the war has settled. According to the Harry Potter wikia Neville becomes a herbology teacher under professor Sprout (who was dep. Head at the time) and took over as head when she retired.

So it seems it was only the period where Harry goes to school that there was only one teacher in each subject.

Although it does now come to mind that the position of d.a teacher is always described as THE d.a teacher. Sounding like there was always only the one. Perhaps it depends on the subject and how many pupils take it at newt levels? Like at my highschool not a lot of students did their finals in history so we only had one history teacher who did the upper years. However every student had to take Dutch, so we had 3 Dutch teachers.
