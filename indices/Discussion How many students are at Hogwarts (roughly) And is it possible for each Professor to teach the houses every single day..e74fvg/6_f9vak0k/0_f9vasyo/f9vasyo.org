I suck at math like I said, but even I am unsure if it's possible to teach as many students as they do... they are seriously understaffed with dealing with so many students.

Plus they have to handle detentions, stopping fights, et cetra... time turners are the only real thing that makes sense, in how they can handle so many students at once.
