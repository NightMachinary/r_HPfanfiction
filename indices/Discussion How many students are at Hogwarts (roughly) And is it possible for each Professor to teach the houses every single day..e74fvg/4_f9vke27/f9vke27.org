Canon has seven class periods/day. According to 5th book, Harry's Monday is double History; break; double Potions; lunch; Divination; double DADA; dinner

Main subject Professors teach 6 periods for the first five years of students- 3 periods per year-group, for two houses at a time = 30 periods. The remaining 5 periods cover NEWT levels- 3 for all of the 6th years and 2 for the surviving 7th years. In order for there to be Professors with ANY off-periods, there must be a Time Turner involved, but really they only need one, which all the staff gather regularly to use as a group.

One Turn at noon to start a second cycle of 7 AM-noon periods. Second Turn at dinner to restart afternoon periods. Third Turn at 10 PM if the Professor is a glutton for punishment.

Associate Professors (who teach electives) have an easier schedule- four periods to cover for years 3-5, 2 periods for NEWT levels. 16 periods- barely half of the Main courses.

Professor Sinistra has a different issue; each year needs telescope time. One can assume that the night can be double-booked or that NEWT-level students come out to spy the heavens whenever it suits them, such that they can proctor classes if Aurora is having a bad night. Also, since cloud cover is a constant issue, there may be make-up observations happening every night that it's viable. Also, winter observations may be cut short for student safety.

On the student side, their lives are a bit more open: 3 periods for seven classes for the first five years = 21 of 35 periods scheduled. 3rd-5th year adds 4-10 more periods of instruction (2 per subject, minimum two electives). If the electives also get 3 periods per week, that's 6-15 more classes, or one period more than exists in the schedule. Hermione actually would need a time-turner to attend all 5 electives, and there would have to be schedule overlap then. Thus we conclude that electives only require two periods per week.

In a psychotic (Spiral) world, additional non-OWL electives might occupy the other two-period openings. One student could take all 5 OWL electives and two more non-OWL electives, such as Languages, arts, literature, muggle sciences, theology...

Of course, since the population is captive and entirely secular, there's no reason why Saturday and Sunday couldn't be scheduled with classes as well- they just weren't in the books.

The Time-Turner solution also explains two other issues: how High Inquisitor Umbridge could both teach her classload and audit the other professors; and why the professors weren't upset that Hermione was using one in her third year - it's considered an educational tool.
