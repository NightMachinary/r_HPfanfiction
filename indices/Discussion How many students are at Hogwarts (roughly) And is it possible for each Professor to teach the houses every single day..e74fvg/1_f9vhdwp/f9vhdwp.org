As a teacher, I don't see the same problems you do. Let's say the first 5 years you have 2 houses together and in the last 2 you teach all four houses at once. So you teach 12 classes. If they all have 2 lessons per week (some years they might only have one and some they might have three) that's only 24 lessons to teach, which is exactly what I teach as an Austrian teacher. With 50 minute lessons that's only 20 hours. Every other profession has to work 40 hour weeks, so that's still 20 hours short. That time is for preparation and corrections and I assume head of house duties and so on. Even if they have three lessons (one single and one double), that's still only have 36 lessons a week, with 30 hours of work. If the lessons are 45 minutes it would be less. And I'd assume they don't have 3 lessons a week every year. They might only have one in first year. Who knows. Overall it's definitely doable and not too far off what any other teacher has to teach.

Edit: classes are 45 minutes and double is 90 min

Harry heard just enough within the first ten minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teacher's hands this subject might have been mildly interesting, but then his brain disengaged, and he spent the remaining thirty-five minutes playing hangman on a corner of his parchment with Ron, while Hermione shot them filthy looks out of the corner of her eye.
