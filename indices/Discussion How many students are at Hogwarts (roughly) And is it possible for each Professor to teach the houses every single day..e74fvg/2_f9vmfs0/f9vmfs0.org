There are between 800 and 900 students.

In Prisoner of Azkaban we see during a Quidditch match that Slytherin alone has over 200 people in it and even specifies that they make up a quater of the spectators.

  They walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise. Three quarters of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes, waving scarlet flags with the Gryffindor lion upon them, or brandishing banners with slogans like “GO GRYFFINDOR!” and “LIONS FOR THE CUP.” Behind the Slytherin goal posts, *however, two hundred people were wearing green; the silver serpent of Slytherin* glittered on their flags, and Professor Snape sat in the very front row, wearing green like everyone else, and a very grim smile.

Also in the same book we see that there are over hundred carriages transporting the Students to Hogsmeade

#+begin_quote
  Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a rough mud track, *where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students,* each pulled, Harry could only assume, by an invisible horse, because when they climbed inside and shut the door, the coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.

In Goblet of Fire during the Yule Ball there were also about hundred tables with a dozen seats each.

#+begin_quote
  The walls of the Hall had all been covered in sparkling silver frost, with hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry black ceiling. The House tables had vanished; instead, *there were about a hundred smaller, lantern-lit ones, each seating about a dozen people*

This is all consistent with Rowlings statements that there are about a thousand students at Hogwarts and that Harry has considerably more than 40 students in his year(though she admitted that she only created backgrounds for 40 of them).

This results in the Problem about the numbers of teachers since the ones we know couldn't teach that many students without Time Turners, I reconcile this by imagining there to be a larger number of Teachers who Harry simply didn't pay attention to(similarly how he ignored the teachers of electives until it became Relevant for him), that fits nicely with various Departments for the Subjects of Hogwarts existing, for example Harry explicitly mentions Aurora Sinistra to be part of the Astronomy Department.

#+begin_quote
  Harry scanned the table more carefully. Tiny little Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was sitting on a large pile of cushions beside Professor Sprout, the Herbology teacher, whose hat was askew over her flyaway gray hair. She was talking to *Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department.*

Rowling also mentioned on Pottermore that Mcgonagall applied for a job in the Transfiguration Department.

#+begin_quote
  Finally, after two years at the Ministry, she was offered a prestigious promotion, yet found herself turning it down. She sent an owl to Hogwarts, asking whether she might be considered for a teaching post. The owl returned within hours, *offering her a job in the Transfiguration department, under Head of Department, Albus Dumbledore.*

Its not a stretch to assume that these Departments have more People working in them than just the Heads.
