From what we can somewhat infere from canon, there are 2 lesson hours (45 minutes each) of each subject for each year, and below OWL students have 2 classes per each year, while 6th and 7th years have one classgroup per whole year (so, all houses together).

If we consider canon the number of 40 students in Harry's year (and similiar amounts in other years) it is perfectly doable for 1 teacher per subject to deal with everything.

If we were to consider bigger amounts of people per each year, perhaps in different times or somesuch, there would be a need for more teachers due to classrom sizes. But as far as lower years go they could be taught by NEWT students for a fair share of their lessons with an occasional chekup by the head teacher of the subject (i.e. if not for the plot of the books Harry could've been tasked with teaching DADA to 1st or 2nd year students as a part of his coursework in his 7th year).
