I've made a chart of this before and it's technically possible with 50 minute lessons, and 2.5 classes a week. Essentially, the classes would be broken down into group A and group B (slytherins and gryffindors in group A, ravenclaws and hufflepuffs in B, as an example). Group A would get taught on monday and wednesday, Group B on tuesday and thursday, and friday would be lab days ("double" classes I guess)
