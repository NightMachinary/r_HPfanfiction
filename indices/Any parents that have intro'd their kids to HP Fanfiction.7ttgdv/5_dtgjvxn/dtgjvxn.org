A good entry point for a child into fanfiction is linkffn(The Best Seven Years by blu taiger): it's Calvin and Hobbes at Hogwarts, whimsical in tone, and was my son's favorite story when he was your child's age. The grammar is a bit sloppy but largely tolerable.

The site fanficauthors.net has a section for "NSNS" authors ("no slash, no smut"). Stories in that section are generally pretty kid-friendly and the writers on that site (with a few exceptions) are better than average for the fandom.
