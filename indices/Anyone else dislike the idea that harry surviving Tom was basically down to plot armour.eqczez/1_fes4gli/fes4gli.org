Most of the plot was convenient coincidence - in my opinion, anyway. My reading of the books made me feel like she'd written her plot of each book before she started actually writing it and just bent or invented whatever she had to in order to make the story hit the stations she wanted it to.

Personally, I like both explanations of his 1981 survival - actively-cast magic or accidentally-found coincidence. The idea that Voldemort was genuinely willing to spare Lily and she actively chose to die which then activated the protection is quite interesting, especially linked with him trying to recruit her and James previously.

Having a cool ancient ritual that Lily found and ran with does make for a really interesting potential MacGuffin for a plot though.

But yeah, I like the idea that she essentially found a cheat code for the universe, where she had to line up a series of increasingly improbable events to make it happen. Dark Lord enters, kills the first defender, she expresses herself, then begs for her child's life, Dark Lord offers to let her live if she steps aside, she chooses not to, he kills her, and boom. Protection exists.

For all we know though, that could've been exactly what happened. Harry wasn't exactly interested in finding out the specifics on anything that wasn't directly related to someone being about to die, so... Useless little idiot. :)
