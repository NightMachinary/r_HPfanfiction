Yes, and I've been saying forever that the plot in DH is awful, and that good guys only won their Pyrrhic victory through a great amount of Deus Ex Machina, Plot Armor, Author Fiat, and the Lucky Hero trope.

I'm even less impressed with the Wizard Jesus thing JKR was so proud of. Sacrificing children because your adults are too cowardly and incompetent to fight sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums? Fuck that!
