I don't know. In my head surviving the Killing Curse was a one in a million thing. It's only under extremely crazy circumstances that it could happen, so of course once it does happen it's seen as extremely lucky after the fact. It's such a integral part of the story that I don't see it as plot armor, it's just the inciting incident.
