20,000 magical humans to 56,000,000 normal humans? That's only around 357 per million.

The estimated population of native Australians before European visitors may have been less than a million...but they probably wouldn't have had as much of a cultural stigma against magic, so any muggleborns (or whatever they call Muggles in Australia) probably got to...you know, breed a lot with non-magical humans.
