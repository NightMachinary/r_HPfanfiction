  making them an insanely powerful group of tribes full of the oldest known types of magic and more

See this is very iffy for me. Firstly we have no proof that older magic is better than new. Old curses are more dangerous if their counter-curses are forgotten but that doesn't mean that on the whole old magic is objectively better. It seriously undermines the value of the research and devlopment of modern witches and wizards. It was one of Slughorn's students that created the Wolfsbane potion after all, it wasn't some ancient manuscript.

Another stumbling block for me is meshing together the idea of super powerful Aboriginal tribes and what happened to the Aboriginal population. The Statue of Secrecy was signed before Australia was being colonised. The Aboriginals wouldn't have to have signed or agreed to it. For a people you say are '/insanely powerful/' what happened in Australian history doesn't line up well. Once they learnt what was happening shouldn't they have expelled the Europeans and hidden the whole continent somehow?

An alternative if you prefer is that they're more in touch with abstract magic concerned with nature. That they had mastered living in their environment to an extent that they never branched out into other magics. Give them their own niche sure, but claiming them to be insanely powerful based on their age alone doesn't work for me.
