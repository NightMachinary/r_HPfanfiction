With wizards being so rare, and with Australia only able to support a limited amount of aboriginals, I doubt they had much of a 'magical society.' You are looking at having under 500 wizards on the whole Australian continent. They were probably integrated with the various tribes and treated more as a shaman/healer/one who communicates with gods, etc. They probably cared less if someone was 'muggleborn' or 'pureblood' and instead it was more like the kids who had powers were 'touched by the gods'.

These numbers would plummet when Europeans arrived as well until there was enough Europeans to recoup the loss of population. However, these people would bring their western magic, the wand. Australia would probably be very 'western educated' with wands with a hint of aboriginal presence and a few sticking with the old ways.

I would imagine North America would suffer a very similar fate (but to a less degree). Each branch of the tribe would treat their magic users differently, some with honor, some with curses and more. There wouldn't be a 'wizarding world' of North America until after Europeans came and the separation between worlds began. By this point, Native American Wizards numbers would have plummeted due to disease (even if Wizards were immune, muggles were not, and thus had a much smaller chance of a wizard being born). You would end up having some wizards adapting to the West, others working with other tribes to find a sanctuary, while others fighting the Europeans.

I would say there is a much stronger presence from Natives in North America compared to Australia but it is dispersed. My personal belief is there are hidden areas of native wizards who do things there own way, and somewhat peacefully exist with their European counterparts.

South America though... That is a way different story. In my headcanon, only Brazil has 'European magic' but it was never able to combat the influence in the Amazon, Andies or Central America. One main reason is that their populations were larger (thus more magicals) as well as having a more organized system that had them have a separate magical world. Thus, the Aztecs still exist as a magical nation, while the Mayans are a much of city-states constantly in conflict with each other.
