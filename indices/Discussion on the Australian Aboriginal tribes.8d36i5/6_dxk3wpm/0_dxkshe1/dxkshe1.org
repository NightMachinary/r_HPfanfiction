How would that school work? There are 20000 magical inhabitants in Britain, which gives you a Muggle/Magical ratio of roughly 1:3500. Australia has 24 million inhabitants, most of European descent. That gives you a total below of 9000 witches and Wizards in Australia. There are ~600000 aborigines, giving you not even 200 magicals. That would be not even 20 students in the Hogwarts age. Harry's year alone had 40 students.

Any kind of magical school would have been built by Europeans and would still be significantly smaller than Hogwarts.
