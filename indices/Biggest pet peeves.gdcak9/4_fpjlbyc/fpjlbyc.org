For the purposes of this subreddit:

1. Standard Bashing Storylines #1 and #2: Dumbledore's deliberately setting Harry up to fail, and the Weasleys are only getting close to Harry because he's rich and they want that moolah.
2. Anything that'd break Rule 8 if I linked to it, for obvious reasons.
3. Being surprised by the first 2. It's one thing if I can figure from the description or an early chapter that that's the way the story is going to go, it's a whole other can of beans if it's sprung on me halfway into a long fic.
4. Not many fanfic authors seem to realize it's perfectly possible to make their OTP happen without bashing the people they canonically get together with (or killing them off).
5. The fact that ArchiveOfOurOwn has 3 separate tags for Harry/Voldemort, 900 different tags for the Standard Bashing Plots mentioned above, and people who abuse the tagging system by only tagging their work with stuff like "i wrote this at oh-hell-no-thirty in the morning" so it's impossible to filter out everything that makes me immediately dislike a fic.
