  Voldemort didn't know the powers he was messing with the night he attacked the Potters. Lily Potter was much more than she seemed. Freed of her temporary mortal body, she left behind a child with a very uncertain destiny. Taken to Camp Half Blood to be raised, he spent most of his childhood in New York. That was until circumstance drove him back to the country of his birth.

  A person's destiny is never set in stone, Harry now knows that better than anyone. After all, his destiny has been completely turned on its head by the actions of both his mother and a capricious goddess. Whether this is for good or bad is yet to be seen, either way Harry's life has been set on a new course, and he for one could not be happier about it.
