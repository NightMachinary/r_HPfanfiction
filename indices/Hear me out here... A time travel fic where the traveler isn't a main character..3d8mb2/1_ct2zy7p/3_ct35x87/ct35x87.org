I love that story! They write The Doctor really well in it... But like CalcasieuRed said, it's not what I meant; I'm specifically talking about a canon character going back from a time post-DH and changing the timeline... basically what I'm talking about is the standard "back with a purpose" plot being thrown onto a character that the fic doesn't focus on much, if at all.
