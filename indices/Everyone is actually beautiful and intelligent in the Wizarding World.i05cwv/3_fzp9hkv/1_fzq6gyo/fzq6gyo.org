It would be more interesting if the wizards treated muggleborns as second class, rather than just outright bullying, because it would be looked down upon.

Complete and outright assult and bullying would mean a lot of muggleborn deaths in a society as hardwired as that.

The other thing is, people like to fuck. Like, a lot. Wizards and witches are no different. So the idea of a wizarding britain population being somewhere around 10k is just... even in canon, it's just downright ridiculous.

Now, imagine a society where the rich and the powerful and the beautiful rule, and the sons and daughters are too many?
