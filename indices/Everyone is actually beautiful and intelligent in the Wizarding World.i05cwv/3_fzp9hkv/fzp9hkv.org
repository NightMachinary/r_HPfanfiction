I read a story, sadly it didn't seem it was going to be updated, but in this world, Wizards were immortal(as in for age, they had spells for it) and could look young too. For centuries. And had been doing so since Merlin's time(he founded this era and was the first Lord of Magic(super powerful wizards who were above the law and were used by the nations as superweapons).

Harry meets the patriarch of the Potters, an 800-year-old guy, and Merlin had been around not 50 years before Harry was there, along with 3 of the founders(I think Grindelwald killed Godric and Helga), Rowena disappeared, and I don't recall what happened to Salazar.

Almost every woman he meets is beautiful and only some wizards choose to look a bit old.

It was kind of weird imagining a society of immortal wizards, and it was worldwide, they were at war with some country in the east.

I remember Harry thinking, or being told, that all women being beautiful kind of made beauty take a secondary role in dating/marriage and instead they looked at things like power and intelligence or some such.

Oh, and Muggleborns are treated like trash, like real bad, Hermione gets a dressing down in the train, they take her biro and notebooks(muggle implements) and destroy everything, and call her ugly. She's one of the few to go to Hogwarts(there's a very hard test only for muggleborns), the others go to schools who aren't nearly as good and are looked down onto.

I /think/ Harry saw it and decided to try and do something about it in the future, I remember it was implied he had the potential to become a Lord of Magic, and it gave me the impression he was Merlin reincarnated(nothing overly, just one guy commenting something and a moment when Harry was about to instinctively do a spell in a different way)

Anyway this would just create a class system even more clearly defined, the rich and/or from old families are beautiful and the poor/newcomers are "ugly".
