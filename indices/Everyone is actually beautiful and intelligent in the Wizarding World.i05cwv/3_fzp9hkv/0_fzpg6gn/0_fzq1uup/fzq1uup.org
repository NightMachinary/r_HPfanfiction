So, I did a Google search(because it had been years since I read that), and I was surprised by how old that story is(and how well I still remember it).

And discovered that you wrote it. I like it, one of the best pieces of true AU and worldbuilding out there...

Any chance of telling which way it was going to go? I (still) am super curious.
