Dumbledore was only 115 when he died, he was meant to be 150 as stated in interview in 2001, but his age was later retconned by her. Since wizards could still live to be 150, as that particular bit wasn't retconned, it is feasable for the OWL's tester to have had the job since Dumbledore graduated.
