Obviously it's not the case that everyone in the wizarding world is young and beautiful, even though they have human transfiguration which we know is (i) permanent and (ii) a real physical change and (iii) used by healers to heal people.

It's interesting to explore why this is the case, I think. The go-to explanation in such circumstances is generally the difficulty of the magic concerned, but I don't think that cuts it in this case, because surely those wizards who are sufficiently talented would set-up shop selling their beautification and youthification services to the general public for a healthy fee.

So I think there needs to be a magical reason why it doesn't occur. This is what I went with in VP:

  In the end, it was a good thing that Victoria hadn't tried to attend her classes. Her symptoms only got worse, and Madam Pomfrey was forced to maintain a roaring fire in the hospital wing just to keep her warm. She was on a strict regimen of potions to help manage her symptoms, but as Pomfrey explained, she would have to get better all on her own.

  "Your magic will fight it off, with a bit of rest," she said. "The body of a witch or wizard doesn't much like being transfigured, you see. The disease is trying to turn your bones to stone, but your magic will turn them back faster. When no stone remains, you'll be free to go."

  The days wore on, and Victoria began to worry about all the classes she was missing. She wasn't allowed any visitors, nor would Madam Pomfrey permit homework to be delivered to her. Her wand, finally released by Joseph Deverill, sat unused on her bedside table. She wasn't even allowed to read, except for three all-too-short hours each afternoon.

  Her every moment was spent surrounded by white beds, white ceilings and white walls. Contemplating the nature of her illness was the only thing that kept her occupied: she wondered whether being a metamorphmagus would hasten her recovery, or if she could somehow use her powers to transfigure the disease away.

  One morning, as Madam Pomfrey watched her drink a green potion which tasted like old socks, her curiosity got the better of her.

  "I've been thinking," Victoria said between reluctant sips, "if all it takes to get better is to transfigure away the stone, why can't someone just do it for me?"

  "Oh, a healer could do exactly that," Madam Pomfrey said. "But then your body wouldn't have learnt how to do it, and you could get infected again. No, best to do it properly and never have to worry about it again."

  Victoria took another sip, grimacing at the taste. "But it would work? You said that transfigurations on a witch don't last..."

  Madam Pomfrey smiled, crows feet appearing around her eyes. She was middle aged, in wizarding terms, which meant she was probably around eighty-years-old. "You're a sharp one, aren't you?" she said. "I misspoke. It's more that your magic will always try to return the body to its proper state. A healer can use transfiguration to help that along, and the magic won't resist it. But if you try to use transfiguration to take a witch out of her proper state..."

  "Your magic will reverse it," Victoria said. It made sense. "So that's why beauty spells don't last?"

  "Just so," Pomfrey said.
