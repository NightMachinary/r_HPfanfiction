Well there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7443406/1/Forever-is-a-Long-Time][Forever is a Long Time]] where MaccyG gets de-aged. I think that's the one you're thinking of?

I also have a vague recollection of a time travel story which set up a Harry/Minerva romance in the 40s or 50s. It never went anywhere though.

Most of the rest is smut.
