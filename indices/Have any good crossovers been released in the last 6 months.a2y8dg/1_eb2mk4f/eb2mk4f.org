Swords and Sorcery, a Harry Potter/Fate Stay Night UBW crossover, is actually really, really good. Interesting premise, updates regularly on Spacebattles, has been going on for two years now, I love it.

Susanooh does a very good job of making everything interesting and awesome.

Otherwise, there's a recently started HP/Worm that looks interesting.

Any fandom in particular that you would be interested in as a main crossover?
