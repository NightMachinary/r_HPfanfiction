I see what you mean. To me, it reads as a slight, because calling an older woman ma'am doesn't seem like anything out of the ordinary. It reads like Augusta thinks she's being complementary, but she's actually displaying her prejudice towards Muggle-Borns by implying that they aren't capable of basic civility.

This is why I compared her to Slughorn, who defends himself by saying that Lily was one of his favourites after expressing surprise at her being a Muggle-Born. It's a sort of casual racism.

Either way, you've said that's not how you meant it, but I do think it's something to keep in mind.
