I read a bit of this a few days ago, and I can't stop thinking about a particular scene. When Augusta Longbottom first meets Dean Thomas, she calls him polite “for a Muggle-Born” after he addresses her by “ma'am”. My first instinct was that this was the author saying that she is the same sort of casual racist as Slughorn is. But there's no indication in the text that Harry thinks of it that way. Does anyone else who's read this have any thoughts about this? I can't shake the feeling that the author was being completely serious, lol.

I didn't get very far, but I had this feeling that >! Augusta was going to have a bit of a fall from grace, since it seemed like the story was setting up a good Dumbledore, and she was acting like she was in a Manipulate!Dumbledore story!< .All in all I found it hard to tell what was me overthinking it and what was the author trying to be subtle.
