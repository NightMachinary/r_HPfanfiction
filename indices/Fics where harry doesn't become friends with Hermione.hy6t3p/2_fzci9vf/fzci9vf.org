I love this prompt because I think without Hermione, Harry and Ron would've been forced to get creative and start using their brains more. Both have great potential. Ron is suggested to be a total slacker but still gets decent grades (I'm sure many of us could relate). I'd like to see the two of them actually having to buckle down, and I think they would if they had to. Hermione became a convenient crutch for them as the books went on. Not so much in the beginning but towards the end of the series she had all the answers and I think that would hold Harry and Ron back. If they didn't have her they would've been forced to be more mature with their education all on their own
