Or they saved but after they just didn't become friends. Ron /was/ the cause for her being there in first place, so she could not feel like getting close to him after almost getting killed (admittedly, it was mostly Quirrel's fault, but how to convince 11 years-old Hermione of it?), and if she tried becoming friends with Harry and deliberately excluding his first friend I can see him getting annoyed and the whole thing going up in smoke -though to be fair it could be fun to see a Ron and Hermione who hate each other fighting for Harry's friendship, even more so if it dissolves in Ron and Hermione acting like divorced parents in a custody war while Harry is just weirded the hell out by it.

Alternatively we could also go with Hermione's parents transferring her to Beubatonx after first year.
