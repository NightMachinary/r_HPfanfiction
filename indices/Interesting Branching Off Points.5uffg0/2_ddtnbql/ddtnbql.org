1981: Lucius Malfoy betrayed Voldemort and outmaneuvered Dumbledore, "The Dark Lord Never Died", linkffn(11773877), showed what could happen.

Year 1: Dumbledore managed to trap Voldemort's wraith, interrogated him and found out his dirty secrets. He then oblivated Quirrellmort completely, dosed him with Draught of Living Death, and locked him behind wards stronger than Nurmengard. GAME OVER. "When In Doubt, Obliviate", linkffn(6635363), has something similar like that.

Year 2: Dumbledore took the Basilisk more seriously, check "Petrification Proliferation", linkffn(11265467), for potential fallout.

Year 3: Lupin took his potion. Wormtail got captured. Sirius was exonerated. Barty Jr remained under his father's control. Bertha Jorkins returned home unscathed. TWT proceeded normally. Umbridge didn't turn up at Hogwarts. DA did not get formed. Death Eaters in Azkaban were permanently incapacitated. Lucius kept corrupting the Ministry. Voldemort would be skulking in the Albanian Forest for a very long time.

Year 5: Harry and Hermione fled Britain before the Ministry hearing, resulting in "What If? ... An Alternative to Order Of The Phoenix", linkffn(5265558).

Year 6: Harry forced Dumbledore into stepping up his game, and we got "His Mother's Love", linkffn(10132530), as the result.

Year 7: The Muggle government was watching magical Britain with concerns for some time. They struck after Voldemort took over the Ministry, as in chapters 5 and 6 of "Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue", linkffn(11961978).

Postwar: The old establishment thought they could sell out the Vanquisher of Voldemort and carry on as before. They were wrong, because the Dark Trio would come after ALL of you, as in "The Sum of Their Parts", linkffn(11858167). There would be no 'All Was Well'.
