What ifs and stuffs: * Lunas Mother didn't die.\\
* <Major Character Here> was sorted into a different house.\\
* Dumbledore checked up on Harry\\
* Dursleys acted differently (worse, or better)\\
* Third year when they time travelled they used that time travel to also capture Pettigrew at the same time.\\
* Put some sort of spell on Pettigrew to stop changes (It's gotta exist, or otherwise a metal cage with sharp bits, so untransforming = death)\\
* Plan before time travelling\\
* Dumbledore going with them when they travel back in time.\\
* Ron not breaking his leg, and then going back in time with them. (Might have come up with better plan)\\
* <Major Character Here> didn't goto <Magic School They Went To>\\
* <Major Character Here> did not have magic.\\

* Fleur Got the Cup.\\
* Cedric Got the Cup.\\
* Harry Got the Cup.\\

* People find out about Harry killing Quirrelmort, and stopping him from taken the Sorcerers stone.\\
* People find out about Harry killing a huge fucking magical snake.\\
* People find out that Sirius is innocent\\
* <Character Here> gets kissed by dementors\\
* Muggle Government involves itself with wizarding politics.\\
* Voldemort chooses different items as Horcruxes, or different places.\\
* Voldemort chooses a different cause to go to war for\\
* Tom Riddle Jr. chooses not to go to war, but to take over the Government on the inside.\\
* Voldemort chooses a less convoluted plot for fourth year.\\
* Bellatrix is more sane/insane.\\
* Different Minister while Harry is in school (instead of Fudge)\\
* Cerberus being deaf.\\
* Devils snare being resistant to light/fire (whichever it is)\\
* All the Flying Keys being wrong\\
* The chess game is a trick, you have to do a different thing to get pass.\\
* The troll is a more deadly creature.\\
* All the bottles are poison.\\
* All the bottles are sedatives, leading to either Quirrelmort being unconscious, or Quirrelmort going past anyway (He could detect it), and Harry drinking it and falling asleep.\\
* Harry not leaving the mirror, causing him to go mad.\\
* Harry seeing something different\\
* Mirror is corrupted, shows different things, possibly viewer doing evil things, causing the viewer to think thats what they want.\\
* A different mirror being used than the Erised.\\
* Harry befriending more people than Gryffindor (He really only has like 2 friends, everyone else seems to be acquaintances.)\\

* Harry gets a different pet\\
* Harry gets a dangerous pet (Hagrid got it for him, it'd be interesting.)\\
* Harry tries parseltongue on the Dragon in fourth year. (Even if it doesn't work it would make everyone riled up about it)\\

* Someone explaining what Sirius Black did to Harry.\\
* Harry accidentally makes a horcrux.\\
* Harry comes up with a better plan than fly away from a dragon.\\
* Trio tells teacher about Hagrids dragon.\\
* Harry feels guilt over Quirrels death. Since it was caused by him. (I know it is self-defense, but this is Harry so he would probably angst over it)\\
* Dobby doesn't stop letters, just modifies them to encourage Harry to stay home. Either by saying they aren't much friends with him (Tho that doesn't seem too much in Dobbys nature), or having Dobby make so it sounds like they are going to a different school. (Probably Beauxbeautons, or an American school, Dobby probably wouldn't recommend Durmstrang since Death Eater Headmaster)\\
* Harry & Ron choose a smarter plan than flying a car through London.
