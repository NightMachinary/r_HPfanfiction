Sorting can be interesting because changing any character's sorting can have far-reaching consequences. Dumbledore, Riddle, any of the Marauders or professors, Snape, the Weasleys, Malfoys, Blacks, anyone. And that isn't even getting into all the character's that are blank slates.

Every DADA Professor has a large role for at least one year. What if somebody else had been hired for the position?

Dumbledore's army: What if Marietta hadn't been a member? What if some characters who weren't members had joined? Slytherins? What if Harry wasn't the one doing the teaching?

There are quite a few fics where Dudley is a wizard, and not as many where Petunia was a witch. Those explore the possibility of how things would change if a muggle had been a witch or wizard. What about the other way around? What if any character had been a muggle or squib? For example, no Hermione? Or what if Dumbledore had been a squib?
