I was surprised to see nothing about the Marauder's Era or a younger Snape. Like, what if...

Snape and Lily never met as children.

Snape never called her a Mudblood. Or if she forgave him for it.

Snape got killed/turned by Remus in the shrieking shack incident.

Peter never betrayed them or they didn't change secret keepers.
