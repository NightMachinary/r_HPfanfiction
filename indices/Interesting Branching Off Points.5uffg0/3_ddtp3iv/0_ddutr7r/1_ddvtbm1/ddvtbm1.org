Choices with that:\\
1. Plot\\
2. It was made as a test for Harry.\\
3. (could go for any), there was no sorcerers stone.

Dumbledore could have stuffed the stone in a fideliused room. The devils snare could have been made resistant to light/fire. The Cerberus could have been made deaf. The Keys could have been made indistinguishable from each other, the brooms could have been unflyable. The chess game could've been made more deadly, or a trick, where if you did the chess game you were killed/stunned/whatever, and you had to do some other thing to get past. The troll room could have had a very resistant troll, or some other deadlier creature. Mirror room could have had more than just a mirror in it.\\
Of course it would be better to just have different rooms than that, but what I suggested would've made it much more safer.
