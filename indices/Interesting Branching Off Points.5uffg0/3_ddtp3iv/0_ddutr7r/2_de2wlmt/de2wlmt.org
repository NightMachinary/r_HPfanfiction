  I never understood why he would leave the correct potion there in the first place.

Magic isn't mechanistic. Perhaps by leaving a very specific weakness in the defense, he made the defense as a whole stronger than it could have been otherwise: perhaps there was literally no other way to get through that fire, and he could only create such a fire /because/ he offered up a solution right there.

A clearer example of such magic in Potterverse the Fidelius Charm: it's almost flawless, but you must leave a weakness by trusting the Secret Keeper.

More generally, fairy tales are full of powerful protections or curses which can only be broken in one specific way, like a prince turned into a frog who can only be turned back by a kiss.
