My favorite story is Forging the Sword where Harry couldn't save Ginny, so I am always interested in such stories. My favorite thoughts are about the challenges in book 1.

What if during the chess game the trio was not prepared for how deep a sacrifice Ron would make? Ron dies at the chess puzzle, they carry on and stop Quirrell. Ron's family never forgives them, nor Hogwarts, . No one saves Harry from his house in second year, a teacher is forced to fetch him. The weasley's are either no longer in Hogwartz, or incredibly antagonistic towards him. If they stay, him saving Ginny second year would create a lot of mixed feelings.

What if Hermione overestimated her grasp of Wizarding logic. She chooses the wrong potion and Harry is maimed or killed. Either way Quirrell escapes. The story then branches into either a disabled Harry story, or a no boy who lived story.
