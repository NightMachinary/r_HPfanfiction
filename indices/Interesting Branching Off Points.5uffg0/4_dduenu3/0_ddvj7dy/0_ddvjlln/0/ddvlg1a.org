That's a good point, but crushes do make people stretch the limits of what they're willing to do. Ginny could believe that Harry tricked the goblet, but lie and say that she believes him to make him happy.

She could feel responsible for Ron being a jerk and apologize on his behalf. She's used to dealing with all the good and bad of being around Ron and can probably recognize this as one of his worst moments. She can acknowledge and talk about that without really betraying him.

You're right that Colin is an easier fit for this, but I think Ginny is still plausible.
