The problem with your theory comes if Harry ever finds out that she was lying to him. It would only make his issues with the Weasleys exacerbate tenfold.

She could do your second suggestion, but I don't think Ron is the kind of character that sees shades of grey (as in, he only sees things in black and white), so he would still distance himself from his sister.

If we do go with Colin, I can see an epic fight between Colin and Ron, forcing Harry to "choose sides". I'm unsure which side Harry picks in this scenario, though.
