You can certainly make that argument. However I think Harry would want someone who believed him to say it publicly because he'd appreciate the display. That wouldn't fit Ginny's canon characterization to that point. We know how /obsessed/ Colin is with Harry, and his bombastic personality (as shown with him taking pictures of Harry at almost every point he can) would be a better fit.

TL;DR: What's Ginny's pivot point to get her to believe Harry over Ron?
