You are missing almost /everything/ that could differ that revolves around a character other than Harry Potter. You mention three things about Hermione: time turner pranks, romance, and an early death. (In what universe would Hermione prank people?) The only thing you mention about Ginny is that she could die.

First year, just regarding the troll incident:

- Hermione is maimed. Dealing with disabilities could be the focus of the story after that (though it doesn't have to be).
- Hermione's parents withdraw her from school (and potentially move her to another school) -- this has been explored multiple times in some commonly recommended fics. Or Hermione chooses to leave school.
- Hermione refuses to go anywhere without a large enough group. Cue the hurt/comfort quasi-siblingship with a prefect. Or she turns Dean, Seamus, and Ron into her Crabbegoyles (if something untoward happens, she's got some cannon fodder). Or she glues herself to Ron and Harry.
- Hermione becomes paranoid and starts laying magical traps everywhere, finding and creating hidden passages to avoid being trapped anywhere, and becomes the Living Ghost of Hogwarts.
- Hermione insists on learning how to defend herself. Every second she's in class, she recalls the bathroom and thinks: /But will this help against a troll?/ Despite not having the most natural aptitude for it, she becomes a badass combatant, though her other schoolwork suffers. (It's a departure from her character, but in the wake of nearly being killed, it's reasonable.)
- Hermione is obsessed with finding out how the troll got into Hogwarts and unravels Quirrell's plot sooner.

You're also missing:

- Ginny doesn't trust the diary because she can't see where it keeps its brain and hands it over to her father.
- Ginny is emotionally scarred by the diary and becomes fully withdrawn from her peers.
- Ginny becomes paranoid in the wake of the book's events, learns Occlumency, starts using it to a dangerous degree, ends up stunting herself emotionally.
- Ginny becomes paranoid and learns a vast array of detection spells. She refuses to go near anything enchanted in a way that she doesn't understand or a competent adult hasn't vetted (to the point of panic attacks). She has to be homeschooled for the next few years, and that skews her education, but she ends up as a master enchanter by the end of the series.
