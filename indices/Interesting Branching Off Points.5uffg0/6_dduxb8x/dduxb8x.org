I want to try to fill in some of the Year 4 blanks:

- What if Dumbledore had implemented actual security around a device that can bind anyone into a magically enforced contract?

- What if Dumbledore realized that one of his best friends was an poly-juiced impostor? Or if there were sensible policies in place to prevent such a scenario (honestly, for a world in which Polyjuice exists it is completely baffling that the best mechanism they seem to have for identification is asking stupid questions about the past, but even that would suffice here).

- What if Harry - on a dare - somehow actually entered his name in the cup? He could have just asked an upper year to do it for him since there's no real security right?

- What if people actually tried to fight the Goblet of Fire? It really doesn't make sense that such a device exists and can't be countered...

- What if the Tournament organizers decided on a tie for the tournament and (after an investigation and better security) immediately start a new one?

- What if the Goblet of Fire is used for other purposes? *If* it really can't be countered and can enforce a magical contract against anyone what if they created a special Triwizard Tournament with very special rules and particular participants in secret? Do you even have to tell participants about their participation? Or can you just let them lapse on the contract and lose their magic or something?

- What if Hermione for some reason also doesn't believe Harry? Could he become suicidal...?

- What if Harry refuses to participate, no matter what? What if Harry only makes a token effort in each task?

- What if Harry got hurt worse by the dragon? What if he was crippled... badly burned... paraplegic?

- What if Harry didn't immediately forgive Ron? ...Or if Ron remained hostile towards Harry?

- What if Cedric didn't give Harry a hint about the egg?

- What if the second task actually made sense?

- What if the hostages were different ones?

- What if Fleur died in the second task?

- What if Harry caught the imperioused Krum earlier in the Maze?

- What if Harry didn't share the Cup with Cedric? What if Cedric went first and alone? What if Harry went alone?

- What if Cedric didn't die in the graveyard and manages to stun Pettigrew?

- What if Dumbledore were actually as smart as everyone thinks he is and replaced Riddle Senior's bones with a pig - exactly for such an eventuality (I'm not even a Wizard that could reasearch resurrection rituals yet I'd be genre-savvy enough to see this or something like this comnig)?

- What if the resurrection ritual fails for some other reason?

- What if Harry took some permanent damage from the cruciatus exposure in the graveyard?
