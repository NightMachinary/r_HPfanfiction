In first year Harry looks himself up in the library and realises how important he is to these people, he wants to live up to his fame. He is a poor young boy desperate to fit in. Is it unreasonable that he would try his best to please the world that will become his home?

"We can expect great things from you Mr Potter." Ollivander said. Harry and Ron used the levitation charm because it was the first spell that came to mind. If Harry had been studying harder then he might try something else. Flipendo is a first year jinx, not going to do much against a troll. Trying to do something clever means he can't stop the troll and Hermione dies in front of him. Traumatic event, failure, all things that can lead to a quieter Harry that works harder. How does he deal with being the hero but having failed to save Hermione, for being part of the bullying that led her to the bathroom. You have one screwed up eleven year old. Will he find a mentor? Would Lockhart be a great mentor if Harry is trying to live up to his fame while feeling like a fraud?
