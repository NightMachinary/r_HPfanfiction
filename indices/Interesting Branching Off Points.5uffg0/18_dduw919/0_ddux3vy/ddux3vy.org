For my stories, I tend to assume that the wizards don't care about muggle politics. All those revolutions (USA, France, Russia)? Just muggle stuff no pureblood gives a damn about.

(I did write a story featuring, among others, a sort of soviet revolution in Magical Russia started by muggleborns who were raised in the USSR.)
