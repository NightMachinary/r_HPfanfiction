One thing i never saw adressed.

What about Soviet Wizards? Or Russian wizards that were involved in the conflict?

I mean, the HP verse is simmetrical in the "real world" but to do so you have to give equivalent wizards that represent each side's strength. A Grindelwald supported Hitler wouldn't have had such a bad time in Russia, unless either the Nazi wizards didn't care or if the Soviets had their own.

Building up to that i would be curious about the influences of Marxist/Leninist thought in wizarding circles. Afterall wizards basically live in a post-scarcity society, the main difference in power are caused by the Aristocratic nature of their political system and by education, both of which aren't inherently hard to tackle with enought organizing.

TL;DR why nobody did tackle the Communist Wizarding Party side of the equation?
