Something I've actually been wondering about for a while is the end of book 3: Peter Pettigrew's choices are pretty lousy at that point, even after being saved by Harry, essentially being a) go to the worst prison in the world, or b) go back to Voldemort. To quote the latter:

#+begin_quote
  "Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You would not be here if you had anywhere else to go."
#+end_quote

Peter's not the most sympathetic character, mind, considering how many people (the Order of the Phoenix, James & Lily, Sirius, those 13 muggles, Bertha Jorkins, Frank Bryce, Cedric Diggory) he kills or throws under the bus to preserve his own life.

But I do wonder, what if at the end of book 3, or even earlier, he was redeemed and was never forced to go back to Voldemort? There's a ton of potential problems with it (how do they clear Sirius's name without getting Peter sent to Azkaban in turn, at minimum), but still, I wonder.
