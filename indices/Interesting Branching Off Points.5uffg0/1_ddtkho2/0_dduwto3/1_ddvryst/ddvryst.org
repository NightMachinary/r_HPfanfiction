Because Madame Rowling was intent on keeping the series as a fairy tale but was unwilling to turn it into an actual dark fairy tale. As such, instead of getting darker as it should be, the world of the story remained pink-esque but got those ugly black puddles from the things Madame Rowling decided had to be dark, and with that we got a path-of-breadcrumbs thing straight out of a fairy tale in a situation when it was wholly inappropriate a course of action.
