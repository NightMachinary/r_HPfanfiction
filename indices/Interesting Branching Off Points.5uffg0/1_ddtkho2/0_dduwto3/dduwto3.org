  What if Dumbledore had simply taken them aside in year 6 before his death, and told them all they needed to know about the Hallows, then gave them the gear needed for their Job, without the Ministry being the wiser?

Really though, why didn't he? I never found a satisfying answer. He even knew he was dying... why the whole breadcrumb-shit? He made it massively more likely for them to fail that way... I can't see how he could have planned it to all come out the way it invariably ends in Book 7. There are so many moments they could have failed simply by being ill-informed. The fact that they should be able to trust Snape alone could have been a game changer.
