I think Year 7 has a lot of possible branches:

What if Hermione and co. had been prepared for their camping trip with say... canned food that they could enlarge/duplicate, keeping the original, therefore not going hungry at all?

What if they had prepared a place to store Horcruxes, therefore not falling under the locket's influence?

What if they had prepared a way to deal with the Horcruxes, taking the sword with them right away?

What if they had been prepared to fight a war, therefore not letting Death Eaters they took down go?

What if Dumbledore had simply taken them aside in year 6 before his death, and told them all they needed to know about the Hallows, then gave them the gear needed for their Job, without the Ministry being the wiser?
