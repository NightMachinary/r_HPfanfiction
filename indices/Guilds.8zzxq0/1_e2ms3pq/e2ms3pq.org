I think guilds could work pretty well in HP. You could have a wand maker's guild, for example. They would have a guild master (probably Ollivander) and regulate the trade and use of woods and cores and debate the merits and feasibility of introducing new ones.

The banking guild would be dominated by goblins, but there's potential for drama when a wizard becomes determined to break into the banking business.

A broom-maker's guild, a potions guild--all sorts. If you've read any Discworld books, Guilds are very important and include a Thieve's guild and an Assassin's guild. There's also the Seamstresse's guild, which ... well, may not contain women who are very good at sewing, but good at other things.
