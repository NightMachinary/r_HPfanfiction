Wand-maker's guild seems unlikely to me. Remember that the Wizarding World is a tiny, tiny place. There is only one major native-British wandmaker, Ollivander's, and he meets demands quite adequately; and everyone who's dissatisfied with the Ollivanders for some reason can go to Gregorovitch of Kiddell.
