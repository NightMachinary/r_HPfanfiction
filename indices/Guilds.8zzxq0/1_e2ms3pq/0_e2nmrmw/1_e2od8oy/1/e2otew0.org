That's an impossible premise right there. Any wizard worth their salt has the Floo, and/or a broomstick, and/or an Apparition license, and/or an owl to conduct the transaction with Ollivander's remotely. It would take a particularly inept wizard to be stranded just at the loss of a wand, and even then it would also have to be a completely antisocial one who can't call on a fellow mage to call the Knight Bus for them.
