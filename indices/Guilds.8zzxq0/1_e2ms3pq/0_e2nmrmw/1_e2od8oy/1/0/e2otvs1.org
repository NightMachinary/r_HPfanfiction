But what about the whole "wand chooses the wizard" thing? I agree, a lot of other things can be done remotely, but wand purchasing specifically seems to be a very hands-on process. I dislike Amazon very, very much and I much prefer to go to a brick and mortar store to evaluate things for my own self. If I didn't have local stores, I would be up shit creek. And what about the shut-in witch or wizard? There are a lot of things that having the bulk of wizarding commerce centered in one area don't take into consideration.
