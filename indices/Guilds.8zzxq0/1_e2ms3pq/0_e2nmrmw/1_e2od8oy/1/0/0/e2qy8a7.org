We're talking about an adult wizard who broke their wand --- and also one too cheap to take the Knight Bus or buy a Portkey, and too magically inept to know how ti Disapparate. A wand of the same size, wood and core as the wizard's original will most likely be /adequate/ even if it's not a perfect fit, and that should be good enough for this Ebenezer Scrooge we're supposing.
