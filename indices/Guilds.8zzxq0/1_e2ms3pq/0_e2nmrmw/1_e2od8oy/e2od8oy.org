That we know of. Maybe there's one in Ireland or Scotland serving their local communities? Maybe some young upstart determined to make their mark in the world. Can you imagine being a witch or wizard living in Dublin and having zero access to magical services in your area? You break your wand and you have to go all the way to London for a replacement? Ugh.

To me, it's never made a lot of sense that the center of all magical commerce would be in Diagon Alley in London. What a pain in the ass for Irish or Scottish magical families to have to make the trek down to London for school supplies and then again for the Hogwarts Express.
