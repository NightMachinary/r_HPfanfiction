An international guild would make sense, true. Pratchett or Pirateaba Guilds are usually single-city affairs, hence why I didn't consider it.

It's worth nothing that Ollivander's isn't "a single elderly individual". Wandmaking is a family trade and Garrick is no exception: he canonically has at least one child and grandchildren, to whom he has taught his wandlore, and who are expected to take over the shop if Garrick ever retires, or dies, whichever comes first.
