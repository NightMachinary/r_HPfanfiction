Wands are so important to witches/wizards that having only a single elderly individual in possession of all that critical knowledge seems foolish even for the wizarding world. I think it's more likely that you're overlooking how easy international travel is for magical humans (e.g. Elphias Doge's 19th cen. world tour) and how a guild wouldn't be restricted to just British members.
