  A guild is an association of artisans or merchants who oversee the practice of their craft/trade in a particular area.

I think you overestimate the excitement of trade negotiations. Most guilds, even for magical stuff, would deal with "normal" items such as magical tools, cloth or books. Any guild for illegal activities seems like a stupid idea because it makes it very easy to arrest the members and/or find evidence.

I mean, I find the exploration of the magical economy and products interesting, but I doubt that you have that in mind.
