Presumably, OP is influenced by Terry Pratchett's guilds in /Discworld/, which have been surprisingly influential in modern fantasy; he made it a running gag that there are far-reachign "guilds" for just about everything, including assassins, in his world. And off the top of my head, /The Wandering Inn/ has prominent, plot-relevant Couriers's Guild, Adventurers' Guild, and Mage's Guilds (though obviously those particular examples couldn't quite apply in the Potterverse).
