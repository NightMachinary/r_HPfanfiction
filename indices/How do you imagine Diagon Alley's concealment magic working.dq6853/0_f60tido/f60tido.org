It's just an ordinary street, geographically speaking; the back of the shops and buildings in Diagon Alley are back-to-back with the buildings of Muggle streets on either side, probably with sound-carrying charms to make it seem as though the Muggle houses on either side are pressed right against each /other/.

Likewise, a wizard flying straight up in Diagon Alley would just see it as one of the streets below, with no funny business. But if it's a /Muggle/ flying over London, they wouldn't /notice/ that strange street in the middle, any more than they notice the Leaky Cauldron. It's not quite that they wouldn't see it; it just wouldn't register with them. Owls, of course, have no such restriction.

As for other ways in... It's almost certain that there are ways to enter Knockturn Alley covertly, and from /there/ you could get to Diagon Alley. The Goblins also likely have tunnels leading from Gringotts to outside the city, just in case, but obviously those are for Goblin-use only.
