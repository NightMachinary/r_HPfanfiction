[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-26436-16/DianeCastle+The+League+of+Extraordinary+Women.htm][The League of Extraordinary Women]] by [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/AuthorStories-22082/DianeCastle.htm][DianeCastle]] features the Potterverse Hermione as the main character. Several years after Voldemort's defeat, she had to gather a team of six heroines (Sam Carter from SG1, Buffy and Willow from the Vampire Slayers, Selina Kyle from the Justice League, Jaime from the Bionic Woman, and Alex Mack from the Terawattverse) to defeat an invasion from the hell dimension.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), is a SG crossover. I would say it could be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][Darth Marrs]]'s best work by far, as long as he doesn't mess up the remaining third of the story (which he did sometimes). The main antagonist so far is Ra, the System Overlord; but Ori the Enemy will certainly appear later on the stage. It's also the sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942), a SW crossover.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12195136/1/Legend-of-the-Gryphon][Legend of the Gryphon]], linkffn(12195136), is about Ginny and Sirius making a new career in the World of Ice and Fire.
