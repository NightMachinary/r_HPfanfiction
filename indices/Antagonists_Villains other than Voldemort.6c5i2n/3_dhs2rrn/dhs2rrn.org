This is an after the war fic that deals with events surrounding the Forbidden Forest. I don't want to give to much away, but it pretty fantastic in my opinion. Hope this is something sort of like what you want.

Features a really cool depiction of the department of mysteries.

Edit: It is unfortunately unfished, as is the case with many great stories.
