  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

  Albus and Gellert, two bright young wizards, would meet in the summer of 1899 and develop a strong friendship, but would part ways following the death of Albus' sister, Ariana. But what if Ariana survived this encounter? What would it mean for a boy named Harry Potter and the events that would unfold almost a century later? (Currently on Year 3)
