That entirely depends on how much plot happpens in the childhood. Don't include things that don't move the plot along or have significance in some way. If the childhood is important for reasons, include it. If the Hogwarts Express is important, include it. Otherwise, skip to the important part. You don't even need to include the first few years if they're not vital.
