Neither, the Hogwarts express is a boring 12 hour train ride and you should never start with backstory. The intro to a story is supposed to /hook/ the reader into continuing on, not introduce the major characters or provide background to the story. Unless the train ride is going to include an attack (which could be interesting if it wasn't a way overdone trope) or introduce some sort of mystery, I'd say start somewhere else.
