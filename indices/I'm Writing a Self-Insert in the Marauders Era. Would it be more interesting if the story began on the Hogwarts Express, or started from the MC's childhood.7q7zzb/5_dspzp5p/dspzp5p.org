“Is this the most interesting time in your character's life? If not, why aren't you writing about that instead?”

Fanfiction can be forgiven for being more wordy or less to-the-point than published works, and books can handle more characters better than a movie.

However, if what you're writing is boring, it's likely the reader won't keep reading forever to eventually get to the good parts. So just write the good parts.
