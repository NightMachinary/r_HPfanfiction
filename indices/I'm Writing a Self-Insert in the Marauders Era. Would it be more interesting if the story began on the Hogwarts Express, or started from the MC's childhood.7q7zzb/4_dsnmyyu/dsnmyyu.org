I don't think there's anything wrong with starting on the Hogwarts Express. It's where children get a chance to meet each other for the first time, and so as long as they behave realistically, I think it could be interesting. Also, if your SI is going to be an influence on e.g. Snape, it's a good time to signal such to the reader.

The issue with starting on the Express though, is that you've then mired yourself in First year. You'll have to find a way to show a scene on the Express and either then skip to a more interesting year, or zoom through the first few years. I think linkffn(On the Way to Greatness) does this quite well, showing the key bits of early years and then giving the story more space and the stakes rise.
