I like the idea of the 'background pairings' tag! I've used it before, and also tagged the background pairing, but in a situation like this one it would make sense to just have that as a quick thing and then expand further somewhere else.

I agree about the frustration when looking for fics (especially common with rare pairings) when they're mentioned and you read six chapters only to barely see them ever. I think it makes more sense to under-tag rather than over-tag, in this case. :)
