I believe you should only tag major pairings. You could include a tag that simply says "background pairings" and an author's note saying that if people want to know more then they can comment, or if you have a personal blog or tumblr, etc, you could make a post there mentioning the pairing and direct people to it.

You might get a few complaints from people who don't like a background pairing, but in my experience people complain a lot more about over tagging of minor pairings. Someone who's looking for fics about a certain pairing isn't going to have that much interest in stories where that pairing is hardly seen, and it can be very irritating to be browsing through a pairing tag and have a bunch of stories where they don't show up all that much.
