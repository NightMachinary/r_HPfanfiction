I definitely agree with the AO3 problem! It would be better if there was a way to limit the number of ships you search for, or to set a "priority level" or at least exclude ships you don't want to read.

The struggle for me is, what does it take for a pairing to become crucial? If they move the plot along in a really important way but are not actually in it a lot, is that crucial? What about the other way around? I'm sure it's case-by-case pretty much always, but I'm just always looking for more input.
