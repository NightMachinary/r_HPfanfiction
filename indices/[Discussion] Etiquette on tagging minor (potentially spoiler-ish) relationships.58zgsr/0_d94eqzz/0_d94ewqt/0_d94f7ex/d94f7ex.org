In case of pairings I would tag it only when if its romantic subplot forms important and big part of the story. There is no need to tag something that is mentioned, even if it moves plot along.

To compare it with the characters. Would you tag Godric Gryffindor in a fic where mention of his heroic deeds inspires main character to be braver and do something plot relevant?
