I think tagging the main character/pairing is important and everything else is just annoying. I filter pairings pretty much everytime i'm browsing ff.net or ao3 for somethign new and if you tag something that isn't actually a big part of the story i just get annoyed.

Similarly i dislike it when authors don't tag a pairing at all. If they want to have some suspense or several different relationships for the main character then i would prefer if at least the possible relationship partners were tagged without the relationship itself being indicated.

I might be obsessing a bit but pairings in a story are fairly important to me because there are some that i just can't stand and no matter how good the story is i won't want to read it. If such a story is not tagged with the relevant pairing I just feel like I wasted my team reading as far as I did only to find out that it's a story with /that/ pairing and then just stop.

It's gotten to the point that I just open random chapters and skim through them in order to find out pairing before i start reading because the author didn't tag them...

On the other hand if the pairing i don't like only plays a minor role it won't bother me too much but if it's still tagged i likely won't read the story.
