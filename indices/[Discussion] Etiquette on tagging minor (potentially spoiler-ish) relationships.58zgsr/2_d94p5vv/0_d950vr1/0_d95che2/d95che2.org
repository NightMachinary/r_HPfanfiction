As I said i mainly only care about the main pairing. Most stories focus only on one anyway. I don't particularly care if Hermione is paired with Snape as long as there's not 10 chapters talking about it.

On the other hand if you do tag it and it only plays a minor role I won't read your story /because/ it is tagged.

So in general i agree with you, don't tag anything other than the main pairing and everything's fine. :)
