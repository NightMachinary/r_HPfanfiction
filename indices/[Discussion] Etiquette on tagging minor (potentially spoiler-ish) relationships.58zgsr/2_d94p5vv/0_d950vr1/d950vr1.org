So, see, your whole post feels like all the same contradictions I have mentally. Pairings are very important to me, and I browse almost exclusively within pairings, rather than by genre or anything else.

I also have some that I just can't stand and make me close a story instantly.

So here's the dilemma, then: would you rather know the pairings that will exist in the story, even if they're minor, so that you can decide not to waste time on a fic? Or would you rather only know the main pairing and then be frustrated later if a pairing you don't like comes up?

I don't /think/ any of the pairings I'm including are particularly polarizing. There's one that's probably a bit out there, but I think the bigger polarizing pairings are things like Snarry, or Tomione, etc, both of which are definitely not and will never be present in the story. Instead it's odd ones, the inclusion of a femslash couple that may raise some brows for example.

I dunno.

I think I'm going to lean to not tagging pairings and maybe as the story progresses I can see what the general consensus seems to be. There are two main pairings that are rather integral to my story line so those will get tagged and hopefully that'll be enough.
