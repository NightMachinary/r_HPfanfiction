On AO3, the most important thing is never fail to properly set the archive warnings and to be reasonable about the rating. Oh, and you should make sure that M/M is in the category set. Those are the things you're kind of /obligated/ do there.

However, on AO3, the tags there are just for people to find the fic they want, they're not a warning mechanism etc. so I wouldn't worry beyond that. Include or leave out whatever seems reasonable.
