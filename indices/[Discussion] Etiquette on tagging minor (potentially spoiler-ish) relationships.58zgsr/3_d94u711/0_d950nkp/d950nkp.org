Yeah, AO3 is certainly an interesting place in terms of content - tagging too. Unfortunately I struggle endlessly trying to upload things to ff.net so I have pretty much given up posting over there.

It's a good point about the warning mechanism thing though, AO3 really has no excluding system so people I'm assuming are searching more for what they want, rather than filtering what they don't.
