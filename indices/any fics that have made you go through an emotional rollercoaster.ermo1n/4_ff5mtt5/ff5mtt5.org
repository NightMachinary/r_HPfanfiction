It's me and so I must paste the link for Meaning Of One: [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54]]

The only good Hinny Soul-Bond and the best fanfiction I've ever read, though it's sadly abandoned/in hiatus.

To quote my review on Part One; /I get seriously emotional when I read this. You're able to make me laugh, cry, tense up, forget to breathe, and make unbearably happy, much more than the original books ever did for me. I was legitimately scared during the third-floor corridor. Ginny's triumphant entry into the >! Quidditch Pitch !< left me with an absolutely stupid grin on my face. McGonagall >! comforting Ginny after the nightmares in the Hospital wing !< was heartbreaking. I feel just as disappointed >! in Molly as Arthur is !< after that Christmas debacle. I could go on and on./

Then there's this one moment in Part Two that comes out of nowhere, yet just fits so well. Honestly, the author was a genius for thinking of it. The effects of which led me to cry on */13 seperate occasions./*

Spoiler for what that moment is. >! Harry get's petrified by the Basilisk. And since, Harry and Ginny are bonded, it is not a fun time for anyone. !<
