[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9167785/chapters/20815621?view_adult=true][The Man Who Lived]] is a brilliant emotional rollercoaster. Slow burn Drarry, and original characters that you will find yourself deeply caring about, it's one of the best stories I have ever read. You will laugh, you will cry - and you will get a proper story hangover after the last word is read.
