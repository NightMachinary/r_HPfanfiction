Thankyou

I tried to not suggest anything To crazy , Like no Useing His Bloodbased magic to unlock the Dormant magic in Squib and muggles or curing stuff like lycanthrope.

Although if the prompt taker wants to they could have harry do that.

Its up to them to set the limits on harry blood based magic.
