I don't get to rec this often--[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308522][Satellite Heart]] is a postwar Harry/Draco, where Harry starts dreaming an AU where Voldemort never existed and he and Draco are in a relationship. It melds together the two worlds really well, and Harry handles it as someone who suddenly starts lucid dreaming a gay relationship would.
