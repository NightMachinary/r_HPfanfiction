What NeonicBeast said. It doesn't come down to them being gay, but their relationship is an important part - which makes sense, since one's choice of partner is (supposedly) an important life step. I will say that at times it seems like the author is extremely repetitive about the state of the relationship, but it does make sense, and I would argue is necessary, given the context of the story, particularly in terms of Harry's perception of others.
