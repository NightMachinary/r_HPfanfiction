Have you read Lily and the Art of being Sisyphus? She accidentally summons an eldritch abomination when she pulls a rabbit out of a hat. He eventually gets put into a human body under the guise of a Romanian refugee from the vampire wars. Also, I'm pretty sure he eats a day of the week when he's still a rabbit.
