Here are a few:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10649604/1/The-Legacy-Preservation-Act][Here is my favorite]] The legacy preservation act. It's still a WIP I believe.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/1/The-Pureblood-Princess][This one is ok]] The pureblood princess. I enjoyed it, but that may be skewed because I enjoy the pairing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5087671/1/Runic-Animagi][This one is fun]] Runic animagi. A bit off, but in a good way. I normal frown on adding things like drugs into fanfiction, but it fits with this story
