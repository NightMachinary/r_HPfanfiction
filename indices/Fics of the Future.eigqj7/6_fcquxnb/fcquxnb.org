I've seen a few fics where Harry goes to another school, but I've never seen one where the entire story is set in another country. The people are all the same, Hogwarts is still where Harry goes but it is in the Canadian Rockies, or US Alaska or the Australian Outback. Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, if he is from the US, he joins every school sports team he can so he doesn't have to spend time at home. Maybe, Hagrid is from the deep south or McGonagall is a native America or French Canadian, Dumbledore likes bowls instead of bowling.
