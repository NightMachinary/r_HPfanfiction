Something about the magical world in the year 2020. Muggle technology has grown like crazy over the last decades, magical society has developed more slowly but it has changed as well. Electronics still don't work around Hogwarts and other strongly magical locations, but people have enchanted programmable mirrors that can run code that emulates a normal phone's CPU. There's a wizard only section of the internet containing digitized copies of everything in the Hogwarts library, because Ravenclaws had enough of spending all their time in the library without a search engine. The obliviator department has hybrids of magical paintings and muggle AI technology that keep an eye on all social media for sightings of magic. Steve Jobs is still around, the wizards cured his cancer in exchange for backdoors into all IPhones. The department of mysteries is working on a P=NP encryption breaker that works by sending data back in time, and someone got fired after using it for Bitcoin mining. An ex-SpaceX engineer with a muggleborn son built a magic rocket engine with infinite fuel in his backyard and now there's goblins in the belt trying to figure out how to mine gold in zero g. There's an international project to develop spells that could vanish carbon in the atmosphere at the absolutely mind-boggling scale necessary to significantly slow down climate change. Pureblood supremacists are still around and spread conspiracy theories on WizBook that the internet was really invented by wizards first, because muggles couldn't possibly create something that great, and everyone else just unfriends them. And some people are a bit worried about the new invisible and silent enchanted drones that the department of magical law enforcement is operating.
