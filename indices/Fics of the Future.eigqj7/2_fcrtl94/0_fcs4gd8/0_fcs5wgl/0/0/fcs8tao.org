As for stealing magic, I could totally picture some rich guy buying an entire muggle gene tech startup, tell all the scientists about magic secrecy be damned, and dump millions into finding the magic gene...

If they find something, it could be possible to sell rich muggles a procedure to give them test tube designer babies with magical abilities. How many billions do you think someone like Bezos would pay to have a son with the ability to warp the fabric of the universe?

And the magical world would be quite surprised to get a bunch of ultra rich muggleborns eleven years and nine months later.
