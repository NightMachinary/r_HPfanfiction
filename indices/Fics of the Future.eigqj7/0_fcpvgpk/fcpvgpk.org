My first contribution is a mildly cliche'ed one based on a book called Horrors of the Dancing Gods by Jack Chalker - James Potter survived the night Voldemort came for them, but he was taken by faeries and turned into a nymph. He's rather alright with being female, but he's very distressed by the rules that come with being a faery. Particularly that you can't cross wards without permission - and Blood wards not at all, blood going cold upon leaving the body, and the iron content and all. So, since he can't see his son, he travels until he finds an ancient evil arising. When that ancient evil mentions his son, he returns home to help him fight.

The evil could be Voldemort, could be something else looking to compete with or even help Voldemort, James could get faery abilities or allies, etc etc.
