Harry goes on to live a mundane life as a quidditch player, but sees death eaters in every shadow. After crying wolf too many times, he becomes a shut-in. Eventually, it becomes clear that he was not crying wolf, at least some of the time. But it wasn't death eaters. It was a new group of people. Possibly muggleborns who are trying to start a revolution and want him on their side.

So he sits in his home and reads the paper and checks in on people etc while the story goes on around him. But he does nothing, because he doesn't care what happens.

Meanwhile, lots of people die on all sides, and everyone assumes Harry is in reserve for the other side.
