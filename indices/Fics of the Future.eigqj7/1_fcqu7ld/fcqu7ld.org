Does anyone know /Before I Go To Sleep/? It would be similar but with Lily and Snape as the main characters. I am actually a Snape fan and don't think he was obsessive or creepy, but I'd love a story where Lily has this specific type of amnesia (if you don't know that specific book, it's the same type of amnesia as in 50 first dates - every time you go to sleep you forget everything that happened and wake up thinking it is a day before the accident) and wakes up with Snape as her husband everyday. She can't remember anything that has happened since she left school. But through writing a diary that she keeps from Snape she slowly figures out what really happened, that Voldemort spared her and Snape continually has to erase her memory while she sleeps, making her forget about Harry. As I said that's not how I see Snape but it would be a perfectly creepy thriller. It's on my fic idea list, but first I have to finish my wip and then I'd write a few oneshots first, so I'm not sure if I'll ever get around to writing it. So feel free to use this idea, but do send me the link if you do because I'd love to read something like that.
