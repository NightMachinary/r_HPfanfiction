A Muggleborn Dark Lord, with his followers, start terrorizing the Magical world, wanting to bring about a new world where Muggleborns reign.

Oh, and they don't like the Muggleborn Minister of Magic Hermione Granger and her toadies Ron Weasley and Harry Potter as well. They think Ron is a pureblood enemy, Hermione is a blood traitor, and Harry didn't do anything to help them during Wizarding War 2.

Bonus if totally new main characters/or those mentioned once or twice in canon. Say Euan Abercrombie or Maisie Cattermole.
