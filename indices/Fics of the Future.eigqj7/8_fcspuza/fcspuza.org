I'd love to see something like The Stand, but the virus only affects muggles and the survivors gain magic. The story could be set after the virus has spread and wizards/witches have to figure out what to do with all the empty space, new magical people, and rise of subhuman magical nations.

Another would be Grindlewald and/or Herpo the Foul to become important players in the story.

Also would be cool to see a Hogwarts club emulate the Scouting system with meetings, excursions, and merit badges tailored to magical survival skills. Like maybe there's a magic aspect to fire-making with magic trees used for wands that went out of style, but was one of the first expressions of magic back in the Neolithic.
