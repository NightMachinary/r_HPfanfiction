Had another thought - Wrong Boy Who Lived, but flip the Dursley-Potter situation. Somehow, not sure how exactly, Voldemort ends up taking out the Dursleys instead of the Potters and Dudley ends up being the Boy Who Lived. Somehow, through having Voldemort's soul, Dudley gets magic and goes to Hogwarts with Harry and gets taken in by the Potters. Maybe there's some variation in the protection since they're Muggles and Dudley gets intermittently taken over by Voldemort or some such.

Could be at one year old like canon, but could also be later on to bring in some of the 'Magicals are all freaks' cliche Dursley-ness for Dudley to spout while at Hogwarts.
