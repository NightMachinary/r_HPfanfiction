I like fan fiction stories where some little detail is changed and the story explores the ramifications of the change. Especially I like stories where the change is some character acting rationally. In canon, many people do absolutely stupid decisions just for the plot to go in some direction.

Currently I am writing a story where Tom Riddle's diary decides to take advantage of Harry's ignorance about him, and to usurp Voldemort as the Dark Lord. However, I have some other ideas as well, but I am unsure if I will ever have the motivation to write stories about them:

1. After Sirius escapes Azkaban, he actually forms a plan of what to do. Why did he not contact Lupin or Dumbledore to explain the truth?

2. Fudge believes Harry and Dumbledore about Voldemort's return and makes a plan of what to do. He could publicly accuse Harry of lying, but then trick Malfoy and the other influential Death Eaters into a trap or something.

3. Dumbledore abandons his idealism after Voldemort's return and uses any methods necessary to end the threat as efficiently as possible. ("For the Greater Good!") He beats Fudge into submission and takes all political power. He takes all Death Eaters' children as hostages. He orders the execution of every Death Eater in Azkaban. He tells about Horcruxes to a group of trustworthy Aurors and sends them to find the Horcruxes. Voldemort would be screwed. (It is frustrating that so many people died and suffered because Dumbledore the Goodie lacked the resolve required for a military leader.)
