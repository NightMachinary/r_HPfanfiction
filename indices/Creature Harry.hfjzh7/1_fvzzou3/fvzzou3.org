Try these:

linkffn(Teeth by hathanhate). Harry is part-creature from an animagus accident.

linkffn(To Ride Upon Svadilfari by Evil Is A Relative Term). Harry and Hermione are hit-wizards, and get converted into part-creatures and shifted into the Marvel universe by their current target.

linkffn(At The Heart Of The Matter by volleygirl). Don't really remember anything about this one.

linkffn(Raw Power by Laume). Crack. Harry is part-creature on his mother's side.

linkffn(Monstrous by The Mad Mad Reviewer). Very good story, but maybe not close enough to what you're asking for.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Siren's Song by hermyd). I haven't read this one yet, but my notes say it involves a creature!Harry.

linkffn(LA Blue Wizard by canoncansodoff). Harry is part sex-demon.
