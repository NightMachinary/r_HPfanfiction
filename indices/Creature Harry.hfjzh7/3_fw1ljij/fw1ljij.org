Harry has fey blood from Lily's side of the family, and as a result the fey take something of an interest in him. It doesn't seem to give him any /powers/ (at least, not yet - the fic series only covers first year so far), but due to prolonged exposure to the profound /weirdness/ of the fey (poetic speech patterns, etiquette rules etc) he does have a decidedly different mindset.
