  I am not looking for stories where the Red Banner of the Revolution is raised and there are open battles between Harry and the Ministry. More something along the lines of spy movies or mob tactics, like "Oh, Malfoy bribed his way out of Azkaban? Guess it is time to torch his house, or maybe tear him to shreds in the papers".

The first half of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is definitely like that.

Two anti Marriage Law fics have similar plot that involve secret assassinations:

The Ministry under Amelia Bones definitely tried to keep the old Order in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), so Harry and Co carried out several covert ops to neutralize remaining Voldemort sympathizers and force the Wizengamot to yield.
