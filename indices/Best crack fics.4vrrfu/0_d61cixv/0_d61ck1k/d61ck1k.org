  Pansy and Justin must marry. What shall become of them and their friends? Will Harry stop looking for Horcruxes? What does Ginny see in Severus? Is Hermione okay? Will Ron stay with his beloved? Four-fifths of these questions shall be answered for you, dear reader, in the only Marriage Law story I will ever compose. Written for the TLX Forum Marriage Law challenge.
