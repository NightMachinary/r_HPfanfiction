Real amnesia can be pretty weird, so wiping out personal information and identity but leaving skills (and memories of them) intact isn't entirely implausible. It could possibly [[http://www.human-memory.net/disorders_retrograde.html][happen]] in that way because different memories are stored in different places.

The reality is more [[http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/forget-everything-you%E2%80%99ve-ever-known-about-amnesia/][complex]] than that, of course, but that's more rambling than I want to do.

Anyway, having use of a modified Memory Charm or one that didn't work as intended could easily inflict amnesia, including one with more "control" in what was deleted or locked away.
