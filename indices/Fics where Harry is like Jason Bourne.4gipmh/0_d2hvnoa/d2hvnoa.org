I can see some major issues here. The largest is that magic in canon typically requires intimate knowledge of how the spell works. And if you don't remember such things then how do preform them? From what i remember from the bourne series, jason has an innate knowledge of how things are done. And several intense memories. So Harry would know how to play quidditch for example but be un aware how it would be done.
