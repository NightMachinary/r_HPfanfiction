I sat down to try it, and after the first chapter, I basically knew it wasn't for me but I decided to trudge through 10 or so more chapters just in case it became more appealing once it got going. It didn't.

If you are going to make your protagonist 11 years old, he needs to act like an 11 year old in at least some capacity. I don't understand why the author decided to keep Harry 11 since the character bears basically no similarities to book-Harry anyway. Just make him older. I mean, HPMOR-Harry would still be an arrogant, pompous little twerp who annoyed the shit out of me, but at least he would have been a believable human being.
