That's a very good point but the story does suffer, for me, from the community around it and the authors personality bleeding over/the whole trying to monetise it. Which is probably unfair but if I had Ayn Rand fans yelling at me for not liking every facet of Atlas Shrugged and had notes at the start of each chapter telling me to donate money to her after being given the book for free i'd probably not enjoy it as much.

Also I guess I disagree with the propaganda and the story doesn't stand as enjoyable on its own for me. Like if you remove the blatant self-promotion there isn't really a story there so if you're not enjoying learning about the authors theories there's not much to read about. Whereas 1984 can still be read as a cool dystopian novel without having to agree with the message. Actually for me Animal Farm is a far better example cause I read it when I was probably to young/naive to get the point behind it and just thought it was an enjoyable farm story.
