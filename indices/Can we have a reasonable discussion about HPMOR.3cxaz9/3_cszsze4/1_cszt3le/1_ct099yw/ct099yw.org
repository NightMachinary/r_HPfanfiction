To be fair, much the same happened in the early 2000's with Cassandra Clare and her very popular /The Draco Trilogy/. Even despite Clare's work being revealed to be largely plagiarized from author Pamela Dean's books, Clare still got several book deals (and a movie deal) from the popularity of her fanfiction.
