/Atlas Shrugged/ is utter shit for the same reason HPMOR is utter shit. A preachy, thinly veiled self-insert (admittedly Rand is less obvious about it) that serves as some kind of autoerotica for the author to marvel at his or her own magnificence. They are also similar in the sense that both of them boil down to "Waaah, everything would be perfect if people would just do everything /my/ way!".

Yes, I'm projecting, but this fic /really/ rubs me the wrong way. And yes, the drama and the fanbase are probably like... 65% the reason for it rather than the fic itself. But still.
