I'm not a Harry Potter Fan. I've read one book because a sibling asked me whether I thought it would help them with their English. I also have only read a bit of HPMOR. This as a disclaimer.

Do you know the book [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie%27s_World]["Sophie's world"]] by Jostein Gaarder? It's a coming-of-age story that is framed eventually as story within a story - I don't want to give away the plot - that is very much about the history of philosophy and a number of philosophical traditions. Like HPMOR, it is full of exposition, and it's a brilliant book I loved when I was younger. HPMOR for me is similar in that its purpose is to explore a specific philosophical "tradition", Bayesian rationalism, as a novel as opposed to a text book. This is usually called "philosophical novel" and is a genre unto itself, with well-known works being Voltaire's /Candide/ or Goethe's /Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship/. Other's are some or most of Dostoyevsky's books, certainly /The Brothers Karamazov/, everything by Kafka, Hesse, Stanislaw Lem, almost all works by existentialists (Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre), and so on.

If you generally like those sorts of books - and for me most of my favourite books are somewhere on a list on philosophical novels truly by incident - then HPMOR is not a bad fan fiction. It isn't as polished as books by professional writers. It's sometimes too slow, or too pathetic, or too heavy-handed, but the philosophical exposition /is/ what makes it interesting.
