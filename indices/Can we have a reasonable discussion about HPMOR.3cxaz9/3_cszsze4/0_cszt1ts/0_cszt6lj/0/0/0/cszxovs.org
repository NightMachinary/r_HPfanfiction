The dementor bit is what gets me too, as well as the fact that Harry point-blank refuses to consider the concept of an afterlife, which to me shows that he isn't anywhere near as rational or smart as he'd have you believe. He's being asked to believe in the concept of souls and life after death by a WIZARD for god's sake, you'd think he'd at least hear him out.
