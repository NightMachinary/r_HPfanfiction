I completely agree with you. I actually like a large part of the start of HPMOR that lacks a lot of the huge portions of exposition as well as the general idea. I think the dementor bit is where I usually give up.

Same with the popularity thing, I just don't get why so many people enjoy it because I do understand some of the appeal but not so much that it's better than anything else out there.
