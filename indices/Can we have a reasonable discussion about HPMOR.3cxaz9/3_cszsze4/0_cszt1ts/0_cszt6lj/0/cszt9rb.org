I'd say that depends on what fanfic you read. I think the premise of HPMOR is very good, but poorly executed. I think the story derails rather quickly, and the writing is shoddy throughout. Plus, as you said, preachy.

Edit: The only reason any of this matters if because its so popular. It is the Twilight principle I guess. A shitty work that no one would ever mention except for the fact that it is popular.
