Neither Harry nor a lot of the characters are children here sadly. But, I enjoyed it. There are bits of humor in it that, in retrospect of cannon, are hilarious. On top of my head I remember Quirrell getting all mad when some older year cast a spell on an another student that he didn't actually know what it does, only that it was for an "enemy". If you think about it, that is very very retarded thing to do, queue remembering cannon Harry doing just that. There are other moments like this, where cannon approach to things isn't just made fun of, but is exposed as almost insanity.
