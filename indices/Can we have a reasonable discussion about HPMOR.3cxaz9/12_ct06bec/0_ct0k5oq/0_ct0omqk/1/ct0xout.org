  Ehhh, not really. HPMOR-Harry bears no resemblance to any actual 11 year old. At 11 years old, the human brain is not developed to process information the way HPMOR-Harry does. In fact, that ability doesn't start developing until 14/15/16 at the youngest. Realistically, HPMOR-Harry comes across as an obnoxious 18 year old.

I'd say that HPJEV's maturity (of a sort) does make sense, in light of the nature of his "mysterious dark side". But this is only explained too late in the story to be meaningful.

Not to mention that the other children can be just as unrealistic, and there's no in-universe justification for them.
