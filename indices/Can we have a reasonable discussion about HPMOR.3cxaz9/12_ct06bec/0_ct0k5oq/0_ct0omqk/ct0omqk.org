  No they are. You can be all cutesy about it but they are definitely children.

Ehhh, not really. HPMOR-Harry bears no resemblance to any actual 11 year old. At 11 years old, the human brain is not developed to process information the way HPMOR-Harry does. In fact, that ability doesn't start developing until 14/15/16 at the youngest. Realistically, HPMOR-Harry comes across as an obnoxious 18 year old.

Look, I get that writing kids is really difficult, but if it is something a writer feels they can't execute successfully, I don't see why they force it. It's particularly jarring when the author is writing a fan piece where the author of the original work was successfully able to convey age-appropriate children/teenagers most of the time.
