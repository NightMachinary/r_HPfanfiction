I'm not sure how to put this, but I think the author and the fanbase damage the reception or reputation the fic might otherwise have. You already mentioned the drama and controversy surrounding the author. When I see someone saying this story (a fan fiction!) is way better than the original, I'm just put off. To me, it's rude and presumptive to say that a derivative work is superior to the original. I'm not sure how to put it, but the fanbase rubs me the wrong way.
