Occasionally, a fic does come along that can be considered to be better than the original. Because, you know, JKR is not infallible, and HP does have its flaws.

/However,/ I think all HP fic owes JKR for creating this world that they run amok in, out of the wild blue yonder, with no "original" to work from.
