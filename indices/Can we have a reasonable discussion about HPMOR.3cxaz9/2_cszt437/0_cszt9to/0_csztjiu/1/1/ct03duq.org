I have to say I've yet to read a fic that is better than than original but that's an opinion thing. I certainly don't think HPMOR is better and I don't like it or agree when people say that it is. As [[/u/AWookieeFromKashyyyk]] points out the author didn't even read all of the books and I think [[/u/SteelbadgerMk2]] puts it very well

  And so we cannot ignore what it says about the Harry Potter books. It is uniformly disparaging of them, it is almost all critique and no comment. It is very much like the college student who decries the lack of awareness of his fellow man while simultaneously believing that the world's many problems have a simple solution. It is overly critical and completely un-self-aware. It claims to be so much more than mere fanfiction while simultaneously being itself undeniably fanfiction.

  And that, I think, is why I truly dislike HPMOR. Because it sets itself in such abject opposition to that view. It is a cynical vehicle for self-promotion that, I think, tarnishes the core of what fanfiction has always been. It wasn't written by a fan, it didn't grow out of the ideas of Harry Potter and it wasn't nurtured by enthusiasm for the world. It is fanfiction in the practicalities, but it isn't where it really matters; in the soul.
