I for one thing the Alexandra Quick series (so far) is better than Harry Potter, but not by much. However, I think it's a bit disingenuous to put it in the realm of "fics that are better than the original", because it's so very far removed from "fic" proper.

But yeah, the self-aggrandising nature of Yudkowsky is what really turns me off.
