  From what I remember, the writing seemed very pompous and perhaps smug about how superior it was to the original?

Oh the author hasn't even read all the books. Which again I don't like as a criticism because it shouldn't be relevant but knowing that definitely affects me reading it and i've slogged through the whole thing.

I definitely agree that it comes off smug in the actual story though, author aside, and it's increased by it being a serious fic rather than a crack fic where I can let that slide.

  I know people get downvoted for saying they like it and that makes me feel bad.

Yeah it's ridiculous, hence the "reasonable" in the title. Tbh I hate that i've even mentioned the author I just think the drama around him has seeped into the story.
