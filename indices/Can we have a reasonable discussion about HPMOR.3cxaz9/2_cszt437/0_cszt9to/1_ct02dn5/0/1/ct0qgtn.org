Linkffn(fanfiction.net/s/5490079/1/The-Little-Veela-that-Could)

That fanfiction features one of the only times guns, science and super Harry have been tolerable if not enjoyable. Give it a read but what ever you do don't read the omake ending at the very end, it leaves a very sour taste in your mouth.
