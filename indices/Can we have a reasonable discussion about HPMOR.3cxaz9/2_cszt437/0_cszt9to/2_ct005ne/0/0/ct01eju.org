Yea, I agree it's annoying. Here are some criticisms without any reference to the author or controversy:

1. It is too slow. For such a long fic, the is to much crammed into 1 year. If Harry had been less ambitious the story would have been more interesting. What if his first 2 years were briefly touched upon, showing the highlights of his experimentation and then we get to see a more mature Harry in 3rd year acting after he has spent the time to actually get to know magical theory and magic culture/politics?

2. To much exposition. No matter the content of the conversation, that much exposition gets boring. I want to see things move along.

3. I enjoy fics that switch character viewpoint more often. It's too Harry-centric for my taste.

4. The kids are too adult like. If that's how you want them to be ok, but it's not enjoyable to me. The canon story is very interesting/compelling without the characters having intense political or philosphical tête-à-tête.

5. I find it unlikely that Harry's scientist dad shrugs off his first sight of magic. It seems like he just files it away and goes back to his daily grind. No chapter about him asking questions, doing his own research. Nope.

6. Intolerant muggles. I think that is a downfall of a lot of fics. We are fed this line that the Statute of Secrecy is needed otherwise a global witch hunt would ensue. People would revile magic users and toss muggleborn kids in the trash bin. Really? This idea does not seem likely to me. Provided the Statute doesn't come down due to magical terrorists I think the vast majority of muggles would be like *"SWEET! Can they do lightsabers!?"*. Think of all the non-religious who would say "see! Magic. Your religions is bunk". Or all the new agers, wicca, etc. Scientists wouldn't just ignore it, they'd employee the crap out of wizards. There would be no poor magicals anymore: they could all gets jobs helping researchers develop magic energy sources, become medical providers, go on Oprah, do glamours for celebrities, be MagicTaxi and charge $1000 per apparation, MagicFedEx, be employed in literally any industry at all and still live in Hogsmeade. I'd like to read a fic where wizards are dumbfounded by an overwhelmingly positive reception that plays to their egos.

7. It glosses over the political and cultural realities of the magical society. It falls into the category of fic that staggers around denigrating the magical world without really getting into why muggle society is better, why magical is dumb. The magical society probably is dumb, sure why not, but tell me WHY and don't make it farcical. Or better yet, make it appear simple first but then go deeper, making the reader have conflicted feelings about the culture: yea some stuff is wrong, big stuff, but some of it makes sense and I feel for them. Make it feel like real life is what I'm saying.

Whew! I'm surprised I was able to write that out without referencing the author, but there you have it. Any thoughts about these critiques, aWookieFromKashyyyk?
