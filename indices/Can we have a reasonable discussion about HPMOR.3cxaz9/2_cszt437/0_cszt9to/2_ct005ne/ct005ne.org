Thank you for starting up this discussion. The drama has seeped into story. I find it hard to make literary criticisms without referencing the author. I feel that the protagonist is a self-insert/Mary Sue to the point that there is barely any divide between the author and the character. I think this could be evident to even a casual reader that is unaware of the controversy. I take issue with HPMOR's presentation as a 'serious fic'. To me it feels like the author didn't know what plot devices would be seen as "crack fic". Examples: [[/spoiler][My Little Pony unicorns, ghostbuster dance scenes, over the top school-wide student battles, immortal unicorn/troll sidekick Hermione, gluing people in the buff to the ceiling (Harry did it by proxy)]]
