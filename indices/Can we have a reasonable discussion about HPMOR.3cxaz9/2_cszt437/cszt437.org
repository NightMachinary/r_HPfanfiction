I only read about 30 chapters of it before I absolutely could not continue. I didn't find it interesting and couldn't get into his writing style, characters, or AU. From what I remember, the writing seemed very pompous and perhaps smug about how superior it was to the original? Sometimes I'll come back to a fic I abandoned in case a different mind frame helps, but that won't be the case with this one.

I know people get downvoted for saying they like it and that makes me feel bad.
