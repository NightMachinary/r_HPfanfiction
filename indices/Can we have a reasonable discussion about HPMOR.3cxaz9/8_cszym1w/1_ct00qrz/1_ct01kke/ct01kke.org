It's not a bias against My Little Pony. It is disliking a fic for branding itself as serious story and then throwing a crack-fic feature like that into the plot. It's pointless besides being a little wink to the readers and breaks the 4th wall for me. It's like the author turns into Deadpool on us, looking at the camera and saying "hehe, do you get it? It's like MLP!".
