The MLP reference is worse, for a very clear reason. When the author includes references to Ghostbusters or Darth Vader it is understood that they are considered works of fiction in the HPMOR universe. The MLP referrence is essentially a cameo. HPMOR is now a crossover. HPMORxMLP. That is a big difference. The other references are fine.
