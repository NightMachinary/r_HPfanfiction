HPMOR was my first experience with fanfiction. I had been reading [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/category/stories-arcs-1-10/arc-1-gestation/][Worm]]. Worm led me to the amazing stories on [[http://www.qntm.org/fiction][qntm.org]]. An author's note on qntm.org led me to HPMOR and I dove in before knowing anything about the world of fanfiction. I was on a streak of enjoying stories with innovative world building with a focus on SCI-FI, and I liked that HPMOR was trying to look at the HP verse through a scientific lens. I barely even knew what fanfiction was at this point. I didn't know what had already been done or what was considered good/bad. I was enthralled with it at for up until the end of the battle class arc when Hermione beat Draco. Before then I enjoyed the nonstandard uses of magic during the mock battles, skimmed the RationalRants and was just waiting for him to do more experiments. I did get the feeling that the protagonist had a stick up his butt but didn't care to much. The story seemed to lose focus at some point. Harry no longer did experiments, and the things he did discover felt like assumptions that turned out to be right /because awesome/. I stopped reading it for a while and came back after reading *a lot* of other fics. I didn't enjoy HPMOR anymore. I read up to the end and it seemed forced, like the author ran out of time or interest and it became a crack fic. Not only does Hermione become immortal but she's a shiny unicorn, troll hybrid ready to be Harry's life long (forever-long?) lab assistant/batgirl. I felt that Harry is supposed to be shown as super smart yet he gets himself and others into harmful situations without thinking the consequences through. The protagonist belittles others, assuming they are unintelligent because they act differently than him, or don't get into Rationalist arguments with him. Here is an excerpt from HPMOR ch. 81, after Harry scare the Dementor during the Wizengamot trial:

#+begin_quote
  /Almost none are thinking anything along the lines of 'I wonder how he did that.' This is the truth of the Wizengamot: Many are nobles, many are wealthy magnates of business, a few came by their status in other ways. Some of them are stupid. Most are shrewd in the realms of business and politics, but their shrewdness is circumscribed. Almost none have walked the path of a powerful wizard */(read:Rationalist)*...When they are not looking at a contract of debt, they abandon what shrewdness they possess and relax with some comfortable nonsense.*
#+end_quote

In my interpretation of that, Harry is calling all regular folk, stupid. Implying that we switch off our intelligence willy nilly, and that the intelligence we do use for everyday life and business is hardly intelligence at that, but simple shrewdness. Now I don't mind if a character calls someone stupid (egad!). However, I got sick of the protagonist, as a blatant mouthpiece for the author expresses that in real life most people (me and you likely included) are morons who go through life without curiosity about the way things work.

Some random critiques: (spoilers) I liked the pop culture references for the most part, but the My Little Pony tattoo on the dead unicorn? Really?

How did Quirellmort move his arm fast enough to block a bullet with a wave of his wand? With the distance apart they were and the speed of the projectile his arm would have had to move at supersonic speeds. Did I miss the part where the villain could was secretly the Flash. If you want your magic system to have a work around for mundane weapons that is fine, but don't bust out wrist flicks at Mach 2.

If you promise your readers a scientific look at magic, then do it. Short plots about experimenting with conjuring bats and looking into squib genetics is enough for a oneshot. I wanted more.
