Agreed 100%. I should have said "I was assumed HPMOR would be looking at magic scientifically". You are correct, as a whole HPMOR did not do that, and camped out in Rationalism. But that became evident to me later on in the story as I kept reading. At the beginning there was the expectation and hope it would be scientific. I came to HPMOR through a recommendation on a sci-fi fiction site (qntm.org) so I thought that HPMOR would be similar.

There was so much more that HPMOR could have been, and so much it didn't need to be.
