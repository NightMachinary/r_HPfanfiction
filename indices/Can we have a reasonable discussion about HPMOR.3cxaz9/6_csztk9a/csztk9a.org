I like the Rationalist approach, plain and simple. While I find Rationalists in general to be blinded by their own logic, most of the times, I enjoyed reading about a Harry that uses the methods to turn the magic system upside down.

But stuff like the human patronus are waaaaay too circlejerky for me.
