Fair enough. I was interested in the whole rationalism thing but the fic isn't discerning about it for me. There's just so much crammed in and I think it's to the detriment of the story and causes it to read like a series of HP related essays at times.

Also I think I mentioned elsewhere ITT that the dementor/patronus thing is what turned me off for good. :P
