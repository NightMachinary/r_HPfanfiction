I'm not a fan. I'm not a hater, but I read the beginning of it (the first fanfiction I ever read actually) and got bored of it when Harry decided storming Azkaban was a logical thing to do. I then went off to find something more reasonable and the rest is history. Since then I've read a bit further, on and off, but I never got to the end.

What is wrong with the story? The /story/ can only really be barely called a story. It weaves back and forth without any real direction and obviously never saw much in the way of pre-planning. Instead it uses the kitchen sink method of producing foreshadowing. Just throw every single detail into a story and then, later on, you can pick one of those pointless things at random and shout 'Hey look, foreshadowing, I'm so awesome!'

The characters aren't really characters in any meaningful sense. Everyone appears to orbit around Harry with no discernible goals or lives of their own. Quirrelmort is possibly the only exception to this.

But that's just the story, HPMOR is so much more than the story alone.

For one, it's fanfiction. Fanfiction never stands alone, it must always be considered beside the source work. In a very real way fanfiction is both commentary and critique of the original work by its very nature, to ask that we ignore that relationship when considering HPMOR is both disingenuous and simultaneously damaging to HPMOR's actual standing.

HPMOR doesn't stand on its own. If it had been released as a stand-alone book with no reference to Harry Potter it would have been largely ignored, if it had even been published (extremely unlikely given the form and length it takes). It isn't a novel in any real sense because of that. It is, at its very core, a work of Harry Potter fanfiction, no more and no less.

And so we cannot ignore what it says /about/ the Harry Potter books. It is uniformly disparaging of them, it is almost all critique and no comment. It is very much like the college student who decries the lack of awareness of his fellow man while simultaneously believing that the world's many problems have a /simple/ solution. It is overly critical and completely un-self-aware. It claims to be so much more than /mere/ fanfiction while simultaneously being itself undeniably fanfiction.

For me fanfiction isn't really about the quality of the writing or any of that stuff. It's nice and it's what I read for but it's not why fanfiction exists. Fanfiction is like an enthusiasm overflow. It happens when an author comes along and floods your brain with ideas and visions such that you cannot help but be utterly taken in it is a wonderful thing. But they overflow; ideas multiply and visions grow into dreams. And so the work that at first only encompassed the external books created by the original author must now grow to describe all of the new ideas and thoughts that flood from the minds of those who've been drawn in.

It starts with daydreams and idle imaginings and grows into jokes and arguments with the similarly afflicted. Finally the flow of ideas becomes so great that it sweeps the pen along with it and words find their way onto a page. Those words may not be beautiful or even especially coherent but they are still a pure and heartfelt expression of the dreams and wishes of the person who wrote them.

And that, I think, is why I truly dislike HPMOR. Because it sets itself in such abject opposition to that view. It is a cynical vehicle for self-promotion that, I think, tarnishes the core of what fanfiction has always been. It wasn't written by a fan, it didn't grow out of the ideas of Harry Potter and it wasn't nurtured by enthusiasm for the world. It is fanfiction in the practicalities, but it isn't where it really matters; in the soul.
