I thought the concept was nice, and I loved the first few chapters of it. I stopped reading around chapter 100 or so, when the wank became to much for me to handle, but then when I heard it had been finished I went back and read the rest. I loved the way at the end the author took one of the criticisms -Harry is unrealistic, both mentally and emotionally- and basically went <Spoilers>

I think a big part of why I enjoyed so much more of it than other people apparently did is that I read it in two block sessions, so I didn't get sucked into the discussions about it until after the fact. I also didn't really know anything about the author, nor do I have any memory of him asking for money or saying that his story was better than the original books.
