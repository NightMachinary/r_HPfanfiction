  I loved the way at the end the author took one of the criticisms -Harry is unrealistic, both mentally and emotionally- and basically went rest of quote

You might want to spoiler tag that btw.

That actually bugs me just because people use it as an example of how he wasn't really writing children poorly. Hermione, Draco and everyone else still suffer from the same unrealistic things.

  nor do I have any memory of him asking for money or saying that his story was better than the original books.

Yeah there's a lot of dodgy quotes out there by him, often they're found on reddit or his website which is why I wanted to avoid bringing them into the discussion because they aren't easily findable and don't actually affect story quality, just enjoyment. (for example I vaguely remember seeing an archived page where he was trying to sell merch and asking for donations to his self-ran non-profit).
