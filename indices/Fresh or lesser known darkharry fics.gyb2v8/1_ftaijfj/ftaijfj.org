I really enjoyed Evitative by Vichan on ao3. Was posted between July 2019 and February 2020. I'm eagerly awaiting the next book in their series. The author said a few months after the last chapter of the first book was posted, so hopefully soon.

It is (going to be) slash, but it's barely a factor in the first book. Even then, not until the very end of it.
