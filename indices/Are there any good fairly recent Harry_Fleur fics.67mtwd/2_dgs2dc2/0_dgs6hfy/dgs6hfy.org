FYI "Whispers" is very, /very/ angsty. It's decent if you can stand overly emotional characters but it was very hard to read for me. (One scene that specifically stuck with me was Harry randomly having a nightmare about Susan and Amelia Bones being raped by Death Eaters for no apparent reason. IIRC Harry hadn't even had any contact with DE's at that point in the story and it came totally out of the blue and the rest of the chapter was stufed with everyone crying and comforting each other and assurances that everything is fine yada yada)

As for Resurgence; It's average, not great, not even really good but overall readable. So far this is definitely Harry/Daphne only although Fleur does play a rather important role and the latest chapter gave a bit more insight into how things between them might progress.
