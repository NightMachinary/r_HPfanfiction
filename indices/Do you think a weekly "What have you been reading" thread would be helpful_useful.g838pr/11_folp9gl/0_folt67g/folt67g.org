Yeah, I wouldn't care too much about that. If the fics are good, those comments will get upvoted, the authors will get the attention they need and deserve, and everyone wins.

If the fics are bad, hopefully people will say so, the threads will /not/ be upvoted, and the authors will get criticism they need (whether they can take it is a personal matter), and everyone still wins. Or, at the very least, no one loses.
