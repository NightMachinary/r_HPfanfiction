I don't know what you've seen or been through, but most generally everyone is pretty respectful. We might have concrete criticisms, depending on if it's our taste/preferences, but otherwise I haven't seen anyone be rude. Now there might be some stories that some people don't like, whenever they might get brought up, but most generally that's on the person's taste/preferences.
