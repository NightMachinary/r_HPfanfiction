Definitely. I'm always reading HP fic so having a place to share it would be nice. I think it could also be really cool if all the ones from the same ship were in a comment thread? Like if the comment was "ship name" and people replied to it with the fics they're reading for that ship. I think it'd make finding fic for specific ships easier, at least on here.

Even if it's not like that I think its a wonderful idea.
