Hi folks! I see a LOT of interest in this. We can set up a trial run of this for the coming month and reassess in June. Look for this post sometime soon!

Update: Automod has been configured to post this. Assuming I did things right, it should post at 8am EST tomorrow morning and repeat weekly. Again, we'll come back and reassess in June. There is a form provided in the post and contest mode will be enabled so all discussed fics will have a time to shine. We will welcome discussion in the comments both of the fics provided and on how the thread itself is functioning. This will be an evolving thread as we iron out what will work in a subreddit as large as ours, so patience and understanding would be appreciated! Cheers!
