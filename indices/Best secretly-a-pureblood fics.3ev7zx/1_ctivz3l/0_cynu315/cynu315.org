I read a fic recently that has a lot of the pureblood etiquette and politics and such in it. It was a SSHG with a muggleborn Hermione, so if that's not your cup of tea, you should probably pass on this one. Do you want other recs on fics with pureblood etiquette/traditions, or do you prefer them to have a secretly-a-pureblood!Hermione? The fics that I'm thinking of don't have Hermione as a pureblood.
