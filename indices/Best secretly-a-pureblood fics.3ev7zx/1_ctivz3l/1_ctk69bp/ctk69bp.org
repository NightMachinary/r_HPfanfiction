I tried this, and I just couldn't push through the terrible Snape characterisation. That, combined with the 'we have to consummate the marriage because /magic/' and the sudden 'gosh i never knew what i was missing by not having sex!!' put me off.

Also, the dialogue is severely lacking in commas.

(It has a lot of potential, though.)
