Check out /In Bad Faith/

linkffn(In Bad Faith by Slayer Anderson)

AU. It follows Draco's younger sister. Good portrayal of how pureblood families would interact and what the politics would look like. It humanizes them fairly well. Elaborates slightly on the HP system of magic, but not to much, which makes it fresh without being obnoxious (like those fics where Harry pics up unheard of spell casting or rune magic from Asia that is waaayyy better then using a wand).
