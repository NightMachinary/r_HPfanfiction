  When Harry loses the Sword of Gryffindor in the Chamber of Secrets, only a firm desire to at least make it through to his first kiss, a generous helping of accidental magic, and a healthy dose of phoenix tears let him survive. Unfortunately, it also leaves him with a blind basilisk, an incensed Ginny, and answers that make him wish Lockhart was still around to Obliviate him.
