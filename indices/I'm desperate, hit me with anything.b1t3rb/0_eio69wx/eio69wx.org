More seriously than HPMoR, here's some of my actual favorites:

linkffn(The Arithmancer) by White Squirrel. Tons of creative magic, good plot (although a bit much stations of canon for the first few years) and it's almost complete (a few more chapters according to the author's note).

linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7). Good Sirius raises Harry story.

linkffn(Divided and Entwined ; Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution ; The Dark Lord never died ; Returned, Reformed and really trying) by Starfox5. All 4 very good war stories with plenty of spies, battles and politics. Can't have enough of Hermione fighting oppressive governments.

linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist) is pretty dark and surprising.

linkffn(The many Deaths of Harry Potter) has a very pragmatic and thus much more effective and scary Voldemort.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina) is my favorite time travel fic to Vold War 1.

linkffn(Luna's Hubby) has my favorite Luna.

linkffn(Just a Random Tuesday) has my favorite Minerva McGonagall.
