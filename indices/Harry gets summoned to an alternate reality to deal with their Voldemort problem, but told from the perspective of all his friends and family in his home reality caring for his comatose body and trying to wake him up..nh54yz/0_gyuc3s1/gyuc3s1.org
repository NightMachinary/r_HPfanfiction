I recall reading a Harry Potter x Lord of the Rings crossover which had a few chapters regarding Sirius, Lupin, Dumbledore, and the others tending to Harry while his conscience or soul or whatever is in Middle-Earth.

But for a Harry Potter whose body is comatose while said soul is in alternate reality? I haven't read before. That'd be interesting.
