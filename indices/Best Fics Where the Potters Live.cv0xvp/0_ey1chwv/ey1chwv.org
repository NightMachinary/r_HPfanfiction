Linkffn(12021325) Don't let the awkward summary fool you, this story is absolutely incredible. Its DarkSlytherin!Harry, if you're into that. If you can read to the sorting ceremony, you'll know by then if you like the style/plot and maybe keep reading. (If you don't like ffn formatting, it's cross posted on AO3 by the same author)
