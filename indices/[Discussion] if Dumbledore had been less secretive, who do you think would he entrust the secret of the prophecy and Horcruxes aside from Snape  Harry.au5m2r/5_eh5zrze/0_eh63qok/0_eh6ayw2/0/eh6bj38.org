Just imagine what would have happened if Moody already knew by then, Barty Jr. would have probably found out everything.\\
And if you can't tell when someone's been replaced then there's clearly merit to maximum secrecy (if Harry is replaced all is lost anyway, and I think he would know if something happened to Snape).

I assume Moody was thoroughly interrogated to make the disguise believable.
