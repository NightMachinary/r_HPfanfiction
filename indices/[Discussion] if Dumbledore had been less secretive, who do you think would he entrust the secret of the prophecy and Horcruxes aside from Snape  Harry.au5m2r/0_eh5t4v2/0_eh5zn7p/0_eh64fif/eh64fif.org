If Grindy still had any spark in him, he'd try to manipulate Dumbledore in exchange for his help. First he'd share a few authors and books to look for, and ask for new parchment, his bed to be transfigured with nicer pillows, a warming charm for his slippers, because the nights are cold in the mountains. (wink, wink)

Then he'd ask for more and more favors, humble-bragging about his expertise at tracking down rare magical artifacts and dark objects, trying to convince Dumbledore to break him out.
