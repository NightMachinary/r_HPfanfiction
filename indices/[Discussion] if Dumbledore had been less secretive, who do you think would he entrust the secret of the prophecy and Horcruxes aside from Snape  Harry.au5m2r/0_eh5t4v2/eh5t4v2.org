Sounds cracky, but I'd say Grindelwald.

The dude mellowed out after 50 years in prison, and up to the end kept Dumbledore's secrets and respected his memory when Voldemort broke in for an interrogation. Grindelwald is enough of an academic and expert in Dark Arts to be able to offer advice and intellectual discussion about Horcruxes, and the theory behind creating and destroying them. The Fantastic Beasts universe also makes him a Seer, so he'd be an expert on interpreting prophecies as well, on top of his knowledge of the Elder Wand and the Deathly Hallows, which Dumbledore wanted to pass to Snape.

Grindelwald has also been locked up for so many years, without escaping, that Dumbledore would feel safe that his secrets wouldn't leave Nurmengard.
