Ordinarily, it wouldn't. In McGonagall's case, I think it is different. She does have a role outside of ‘just a Professor' and clearly knows more than someone like Sprout or Hooch. She is a member of the Order of the Phoenix, and knows everything a regular Order member would know. The thing is, she's portrayed as more than just an order member. For the most part, she's portrayed as a strong supporter of Dumbledore and very close to him both personally and professionally. With Harry too young to take on the role of leader, it looks like she would be perfectly positioned to take over when Dumbledore died, as she would be able to run both the school and the Order.

The other option would be Shacklebolt, little as he is seen, because he is a senior Order member and a senior law enforcement member.

Both, however, are completely lacking in knowledge where it counts. They both have the basic information that the entire order has access to, but were never informed beyond, ‘Must protect Harry!'

Personally, I see this as either:

- An issue with Dumbledore himself, that he gave the information to Harry and Snape, yet withheld it from both of his two possible replacements,

- Or a shortcoming of JKR's, in that she may just have forgotten or not bothered to make sure that Dumbledore had told someone else. She may even have done it deliberately to create drama and stuff without thinking of or caring about the implications.
