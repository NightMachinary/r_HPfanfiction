I always felt like Dumbledore was humbly arrogant. He recognized all his faults, but he saw everyone else as having more faults them himself. He was wise, he must protect them from the truth, let them live a happy lie as long as possible, etc. Everyone is flawed, but he is less flawed than the others. Nothing evil or wrong about it. In fact, I think that idea even has some merit.

A defining traits of Dumbledore was being secretive. I think there would need to be a significant event that directly connected the horcruxes to that person. One example immediately springs to mind: Neville Longbottom. If anyone would be told after them, it would be him. Just as Harry told Neville in a roundabout way before he went to his death via Voldemort. There would need to be a chance Harry was not the chosen one for Dumbles to do this. Next would be McGonagall maybe.
