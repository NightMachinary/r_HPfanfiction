Young would be the proper word. Harry had a lot of responsibility, but he was still young. The end of OotP was proof enough of that. Although, that tantrum likely helped Dumbledore trust him oddly enough. I don't know how Dumbles saw Harry, but I imagine it was a very much "If anyone else could, I'd get them to" situation. Dumbledore would have let Harry live without knowing a single thing about horcruxes even though he had one within him if at all possible.
