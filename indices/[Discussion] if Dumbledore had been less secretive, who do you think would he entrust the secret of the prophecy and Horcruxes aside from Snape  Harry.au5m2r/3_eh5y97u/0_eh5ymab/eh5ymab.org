Moody was tricked and replaced by Barty Jr for a whole year, without Dumbledore suspecting until the end---even though he and Moody were good friends back in the days of the original Order. I think that Dumbledore would be cautious around Real Moody afterwards, even after knowing he's the real thing.

Also, aren't the Flamels dead after their Stone was destroyed at the end of Book 1? They only kept enough Elixir of Life to "set their affairs in order".
