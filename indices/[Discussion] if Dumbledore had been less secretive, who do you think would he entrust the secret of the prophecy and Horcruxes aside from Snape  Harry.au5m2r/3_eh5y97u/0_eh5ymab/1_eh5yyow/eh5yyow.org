  Also, aren't the Flamels dead after their Stone was destroyed at the end of Book 1? They only kept enough Elixir of Life to "set their affairs in order".

Sure, but this is all about a potential AU anyway; the Flamels might well survive. Besides which, without being sure, Dumbledore also suspected Voldemort had Horcruxes /before/ 1991. It is after all to protect the Stone from the shade of the Dark Lord that Flamel had Dumbledore protect the Stone at Hogwarts in the first place. You could well imagine Flamel asking Dumbledore, "by the way, /mon ami/, zis Voldemor' who is threatening my Stone, wasn't he supposed to be dead?" and Dumbledore explaining his theory to him in reply.
