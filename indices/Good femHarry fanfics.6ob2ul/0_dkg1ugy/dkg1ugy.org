I have the feeling this exact question comes up every two days or so, always with the same fanfic recommendations. Well it is a pain in the ass to find good stories in this particular niche, so I´m glad to help. linkffn(Call me Moriarty) This one got a update after a long hiatus, then we have philosophize, where fem!harry is usually a bit darker than her canon counterpart linkffn(Yule Ball Panic; The Power of Love; The Death of Natasha Romanoff; Iris Potter, Agent of SHIELD), though they might not be the kind of dark you want. Then we have Nemesis13 with about half a dozen started fanfics, that get sporadic updates linkffn(Another Day in the Life of Potter-Redux; A Black Halloween; The True Blood Princess). DylantheRabbit, admittedly generally a bit trashy but the Silent world of Cassandra might have the most entertaining babyeating evil Dumbledore and generally other entertaining fics mostly focused on fem!harry linkffn(The Silent World of Cassandra Evans; Season of the Witch). You already know silently watches, but there also is inwardtransience linkffn(The Long Game; To Reach Without). Other good fem!harry fics are linkffn(Harri Potter and the Lost Shepard; A Long Journey Home; Dahlia Evans & the Broken Bridge) of them only A Long Journey Home could be classified as dark fem!harry, but I doubt it´s in the way you mean.
