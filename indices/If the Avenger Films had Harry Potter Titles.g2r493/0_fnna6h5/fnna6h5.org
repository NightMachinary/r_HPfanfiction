Keep in mind Harry Potter titles are generally from nouns not actions, and they don't tend to reveal plot points (like, the titles aren't spoilers).

So like...

The Avengers and the God's Scepter The Avengers and the Mad Titan The Avengers and the Infinity Stones

I've been trying to come up with a good one for Age of Ultron but haven't found anything right. Maybe The Avengers and the Overabundant Plot Hooks lol
