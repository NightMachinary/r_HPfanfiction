Yup. Lucius is a pretty slick political operator. He overreached a bit in the Chamber incident, but he still suffered very little lose for it, and he probably did a lot to undermine the Ministry and lay the groundwork for Voldemort's return (even if he didn't realize at first that Voldemort was still alive). At the start of the series Fudge is hanging on Dumbledore's every word like a little puppy, but as time goes on he listens more and more to Malfoy, and becomes more and more hostile to Dumbledore. Malfoy, his money and his connections, are arguably the most dangerous weapons at Voldemort's disposal in canon. Yeah, I can totally see him giving Lawyer Harry a run for his money in this arena.
