Nice idea, but this sort of lawyering your way out is only fun when it's based on a real world system, or the laws are well established before being used (eg. using foreshadowing/precedents against the protagonists). For example, say Malfoy uses a law about lost property to steal Neville's Remembrall. Harry then uses his invisibility cloak to steal from Malfoy and then use that same law to claim ownership. Or better still, uses it to incriminate Lucius with ownership of the diary after second year.

Or if a law is used to try and nail the protagonist, but he uses a technicality to not only evade the charge but benefit from it. I saw this done in a fic where Harry is tried in a full courtroom after the Dementor attack in book 5. But flips it around and states that only adults are tried in a full courtroom therefore he is being charged as an adult for underage magic, which by definition is incongruous. Also, as he has been declared an adult by the Wizengamot through the legalities of the trial, he is effectively emancipated (i.e. no Trace), doesn't have to go back to the Dursleys, as well as cast magic whenever and wherever he likes as long as he isn't violating the SoS.

Simply introducing laws as required with obvious gaping loopholes (like in your short) that the protagonist then uses with impunity is not good writing.
