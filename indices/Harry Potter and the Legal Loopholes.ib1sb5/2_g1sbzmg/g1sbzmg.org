I love this prompt so much, there's so much you could do with it. This idea burrowed into my brain from it - not so much focus on the loopholes aspect, but where I think this lifestyle might eventually lead:

â€‹

"Good evening my friends, thank you all for once again gracing us and for all of the great risks that you all continue to take in service of this cause. Lord Voldemort is moving swiftly to rebuild the powerbase he once had, and the efforts of you all are vital in attempting to nullify this threat and protect our way of life."

Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts and secret vigilante leader extraordinaire was in his element. It was the latest in a string of meetings of the Order of the Phoenix, and he was holding court over the group of loyal fighters that he had assembled here in the basement of Grimmauld Place. Of course, the circumstances being the return of Voldemort and the start of a second war to destroy the wizarding world was less than ideal, but he really did revel in this role - politics and schooling be damned, this is what he was born to do!

Unfortunately, his good mood and pre-prepared speech were both shattered into small pieces by the sounds of a large crash coming from upstairs, and the sounds of loud shouting that followed did nothing to calm the sense of shock that had crashed over him at the interruption.

"We're under attack!" he cried, "Your wands, all of you, we must defend headquarters at all costs! Lord Voldemort cannot be allowed to breach these halls, and must not be allowed to retrieve Harry!"

"But Albus, how did they find us?!" cried Molly Weasley, "The house is under the Fidelius!"

"A traitor!" barked Alastor Moody as he strode to the head of the table. "You've been careless Albus! CONSTANT VIGILANCE! Someone has betrayed us all!"

Before the conversation could degenerate further, the yelling from upstairs grew louder still. The voices of children became audible, and with Molly Weasley's wails about her babies starting up in earnest Albus scampered as quickly as he could towards the stairs.

"Quickly, all of you!" he cried as he climbed them. "We must defend the..."

But before he could reach the door it was thrown open, and bright daylight flooded the dimly lit room. It took him a moment for his eyes to adjust, but when he did he goggled at what he saw. For it was not Death Eaters that confronted him, but two sharply dressed lawyers in suits, flanked by others who were clearly members of the muggle police force.

"Albus Dumbledore?" the police officer on the right asked as he stepped forward. "You're under arrest for kidnapping, child endangerment, and the formation and operation of an illegal terrorist group."

"Wha...what?! On whose authority?!" he spat out over the sounds of general chaos that this statement was causing amongst the members of the Order behind him.

"We're empowered by her majesty's government to uphold the law, sir. And once we received a tip from a Mr Harry Potter about the situation here we had to act immediately. I have to say sir, it was mighty foolish of you to allow your captives access to messenger birds."

"But...but no-one is a prisoner here!" he babbled, "these are all my friends and guests - including young Harry! I'm sure that should you speak to him you would find that..."

"I'm sorry sir." came Harry's voice, as he stepped out from behind the back of the lawyers. "But I'm afraid I was left with no choice. You were in clear breach of the Child Abduction Act of 1984 when you removed me from my guardians last night, and I've already been attacked twice by Doxies over the course of the day during Mrs Weasley's forced labour. It's clear that you're in breach of both Child Rights legislation, as well as your duty of care to your students. I really had no choice but to report you. Fortunately I still had the paper bearing the Fidelius secret that Mr Moody gave me last night, to guide the authorities."

"But...but what about Lord Voldemort, Harry?!" he sputtered. "Without us, who will be able to assist you in your fight against him?! You must kill him Harry - I was waiting to reveal it to you at the correct moment, but only you can rid us of him!"

"He wants to turn the kid into a murderer too?" Muttered the policeman on the left. "Good god we've got a lunatic here lads. We'll get a promotion for this one!"

"Don't worry sir, it's all taken care of." Harry confidently replied. "I filed a criminal suit against Mr Riddle several weeks ago for the murder of my parents. The date of the preliminary hearing should be set soon. I'll defeat him in a way that he can't possibly defend against - using a sound and well constructed argument that upholds the laws of the land. Once he's behind bars, we'll have no more need to worry."

Albus was speechless. He remained silent as he was read his rights, handcuffed, then placed into the back of a police van alongside the other Order members. The last thing he thought before he was driven away was "curse those damn attornies".
