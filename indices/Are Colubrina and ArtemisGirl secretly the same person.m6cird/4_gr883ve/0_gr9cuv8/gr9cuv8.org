You flatter me :D

/New Blood/ is very long. Should you ever return to reading HP fanfiction, I recommend reading it in chunks, like one book or half a book at a time. I have reasonable chunks suggested on the A/N on Chapter 1, because I'm well aware that it's too long and insane, but I'm having too much fun writing it and don't care~ :D;

And /Rebuilding/ will stay in the top spot for a while and won't be overtaken anytime soon, haha. Not for a year or two at least, at current rates :)
