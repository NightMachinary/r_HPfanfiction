I got told about this on twitter, and this is really awesome and hilarious and flattering, but I am not both me and ArtemisGirl! (and also, I am MUCH too lazy to write a 600,000+ word fic! That's an actual epic!!)

I just update on Tuesday whenever I get around to it, so the timing this week was happenstance. New Blood sounds fabulous, and I hope it overtakes Rebuilding in the review count soon :)
