This theory is hilarious and hysterical and amazing all at once. It's entirely incorrect, but it's hysterical to me.

Colubrina has been a major player in the Harry Potter fandom, especially in Hermione-centric spaces (ex. Granger Enchanted), for YEARS. Her fic /Rebuilding/ is the #1 most reviewed Harry Potter fanfiction of all time. She is very, very well known. She has a tumblr, I believe, where people can message her directly.

I, by contrast, have dicked around in the Harry Potter fandom for ages, but only became a recognizable Big Name Authorâ„¢ with /New Blood/, which has found a lot of popularity.

If I were secretly Colubrina, Colubrina would, essentially, be competing with herself for most reviewed HP fanfic, as /New Blood/ is getting up their in the numbers. And she has no need to do that at all, given her popularity and fanatic following.

I read /Green Girl/, /The Muddy Princess/, and /Lady of the Lake/ from Colubrina before I started /New Blood/, along with a dozen other Slytherin!Hermione fics (/Applied Cultural Anthropology/, most notably, which was my main inspiration and broke my heart when it was abandoned). I enjoyed them, but they all veered a little too OOC for my tastes, many with a little too Dark!Hermione. So I started writing my own.

I am highly amused to hear that someone thought we might be the same person. Our writing styles are /very,/ very different, hahaha. I am vaguely flattered(ish), but I suspect Colubrina might be offended, hearing such a thing.

I kind of hope someone asks her on her tumblr just to see how she would respond.

(which, admittedly, we /did/ update very close in timing today. I suspect she probably just updates as soon as she gets to work, similar to me?)

*Spoiler from Friday's* */New Blood/* *chapter as proof of identity*: Cedric's lesson about compatible magic left Hermione wondering. Not so much about compatibility, but about magic itself.

She remembered over the summer, her difficulty with wandless magic lay within her magic having a strong identity as hers, and when she'd meditated on it, it had felt more like her magic was her than just part of her -- like without her magic, she wouldn't be a person at all.
