Nah. That theory is small-time. The real tea is this: There's only one author in the Harry Potter fandom.

There's only readers, and then one writer, sat in a basement under a log cabin in the middle of nowhere in Canada, hopped up on Monster Energy and typing. Always typing. And they write enough words that it actually has an effect on the universe (the illuminati saw to that) and can time travel unconsciously so they finish all their updates - it's like how every electron is really just one electron moving real quick-like. Every writer posting in forums and things claim they exist, but really they're just Black Box AI programs designed by the CIA to keep us living in cities so the 5G Towers can reach us and control our minds. Maintains their investment in the Canadian Basement Person.

That's why some fics just stop and never get finished - the timespace continuum demands it, and then the CIA AIs crash. :)

Wowzers. If I could play an instrument 'Canadian Basement Person' would totes be the name of my Indie Folk-Techno Band. :D
