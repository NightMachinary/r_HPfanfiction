Litierally the first three paragraphs of /Seventh Horcrux/

/I am Lord Voldemort, and I was one step away from conquering Wizarding Britain./

/October 31st, 1981 began as a fairly normal day -- arranging raids, crucioing incompetents, lazing about on my throne -- yet it seemed that everything my followers did irked me./

/Bellatrix crouched at my feet, sneaking glances and occasionally emitting dreamy sighs -- exactly the sort of behavior that caused me to turn myself into a nose-less snake. Rabastan Lestrange was playing a game called Curse the Recruits, the recruits were screaming, Nott was paging through one of my Dark tomes, and Lucius had disappeared to go brush his hair or something. There were worse ways to spend Halloween, I supposed./
