I agree with the suggestion that Rowling didn't think this one through - still, I like some of those fictions you mention!

Still, if what you suggest were the case:

Why would Hogwarts not use some portraits as instructors? They'd could teach classes just as effectively as real teachers if they had some way of controlling the class and hand out punishments (and they'd need to be highly damage resistant because of dangerous magic in their vicinity and because disgruntled students might try to destroy a portrait that punished them!) and would give the real teachers some breathing room (they are stretched quite thin as it is...I mean McGonagall has it the worst: Teacher, Head of House (not that she's a good one, she's too hands off and not really involved with her house...then again: So are Snape and Flitwick! We don't know how Sprout handles her 'Puffs!) and Deputy-Headmistress, but the others aren't much better off...still beats me why they have one teacher teach all 7 years!)

In a way portraits are really powerful - they are even a kind of way to cheat death (a form of immortality)...depends on their limitations (did Rowling ever speak about that? - If not it's up to the author, so they can be quite powerful - especially if you think something up like them being tied into a place's wards and controlling them etc.)
