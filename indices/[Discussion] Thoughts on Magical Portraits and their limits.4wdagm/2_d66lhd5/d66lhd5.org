I've been toying with the idea that, like ghosts, portraits are a sort of "imprint" of the soul. Ghosts are natural imprints, and one day inspired a wizard to copy the effect. I haven't put too much thought into it, and like others, I haven't nailed down any firm set of limitations. But that's my personal thought on it.
