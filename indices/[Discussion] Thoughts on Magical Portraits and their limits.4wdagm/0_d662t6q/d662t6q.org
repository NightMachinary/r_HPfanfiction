Portraits are a cool worldbuilding idea on the surface, but JK clearly didn't think them through.

Are portraits simply a "record" of the person at the time of the portrait's creation, or are they magical AIs? Walburga Black's portrait gets pissed at Order members in OotP, which implies it can recognize them, which means the portrait had to have been able to learn new facts long after Walburga herself had died. This is canon. Is it simply an impression of the portrait learning new facts? Going by Sirius' words, it seems to "portray" Walburga's personality accurately. He refers to the portrait as his mother. The Fat Lady is referred to as the Fat Lady, not Fat Lady's portrait.

A plot hole waiting to blow up, imo. Like Felix Felicis, I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole.
