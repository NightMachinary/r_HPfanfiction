in the hp universe not having a soul is the same as serious brain damage, portraits don't have souls. i imagine dumbles was charmed in unique ways to make it useful against riddle but that's about it. same with the black, hers probably had specific charms added to make it react that way. i didn't see any sign of intelligence or cunning.

so, some portraits are probably unique, but not able to change their minds much.
