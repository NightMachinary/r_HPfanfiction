This really makes me want to see a fi where a young, pre-hogwarts Harry (8 or 9 or something) is entered into the tournament with all the other champions from the books. The interactions between them would be great. Imagine an Olderbrother!Viktor Krum and Cedric Diggory. Or Harry being friends with Gabrielle, and Fluer doing a momma bird to protect him.
