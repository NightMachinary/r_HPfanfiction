Monochromatic is about Pansy after the events of canon, and ends with her and Charlie getting together. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4083577]]

Rebuilding has a Pansy/Charlie subplot- they actually get married-, but it doesn't get revealed until later. spoilers, i guess? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11439594/1/Rebuilding]]
