Several years ago, my boyfriend (now husband) got a book made of my favorite funny fic, Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor.

When I opened the gift at Christmas, I thought it was the play Equus because [[https://i.imgur.com/ikyEoPI.jpg][THIS]] pic is the one he chose to be the back cover.

I flipped it over and realized what it was. One of the best gifts he's ever given me, honestly.
