When I was in college, I did this a few times. Many classes had computers for the students, but not all. So, for example in my Metallurgy class, it was a ton of note taking, followed by some practical applications. So, I'd print out a few chapters of a fic I was reading to pass the time while in there. This was in 2009-2010.
