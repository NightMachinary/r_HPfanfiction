In school I did occasionally print off some chapters of whatever fic I was reading so I could read at any time without hogging the school computers. (I got kicked off them more than once because I was reading fics while other people needed to do actual work; and it was a boarding school so we're not just talking during school hours.) I didn't have to worry about paying for paper/ink then, plus they had laser printers so a lot quicker than my inkjet.

But these days printing costs me paper and ink, and it's way easier just to download for my ereader.
