Oh god, it's not that at all!

I just think we're bloody lucky JK Rowling allows us to write fanfic. Plenty of authors don't allow fanfic and threaten sites with legal action if they host it. We're borrowing her universe and her characters and it's really shitty to profit off her good faith in that way.
