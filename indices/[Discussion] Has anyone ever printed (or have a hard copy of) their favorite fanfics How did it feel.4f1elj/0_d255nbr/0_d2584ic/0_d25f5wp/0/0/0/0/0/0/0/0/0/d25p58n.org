I disagree with your assertion that authors would be "presumptuous" and "self-important" to request fanfic sites not to allow fanfics of their work. I see fanfic as a privilege that should be protected by the community treating authors with respect, whereas I feel that you see it as an entitlement, and that anything goes as long as it's legal.
