I'm afraid I disagree. I think fanfic is a wonderful thing and I think authors who accept, and even encourage it, are brilliant people. But at the end of the day, the worlds, characters and plots they created are theirs, and they don't owe us anything. For some arsehole to use it to profit is a huge slap in the face.

Creative skills are constantly devalued. Creatives are expected to work for free, whether for "experience" or as a "favour", they face an industry overwhelmingly propped up by nepotism, and they face constant assumptions that their skills are merely hobbies. You wouldn't be able to use any other professional's work in this way, so we should be grateful that we can for fanfic.

I'm not saying we shouldn't be able to write fanfic, at all. I'm saying that whoever is selling DAYD, and whoever has bought it... They're immoral. They make the community look bad. They discourage authors from allowing fanfic sites to host fics based from their work. And we should overwhelmingly criticise them.
