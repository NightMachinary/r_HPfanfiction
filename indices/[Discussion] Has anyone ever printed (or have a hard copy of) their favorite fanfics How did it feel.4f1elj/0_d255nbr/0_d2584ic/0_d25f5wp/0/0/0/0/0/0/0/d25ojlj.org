You're still talking about creatives though. This is what I mean, people are able to use their work a lot, and that's great and something that should be protected, but it leads to a culture that devalues things like art, music and literature. It makes it so much harder to protect that right (that we should be insanely grateful for and respectful of) when people stop using fanfic as a hobby and start trying to change it into something that personally profits them.
