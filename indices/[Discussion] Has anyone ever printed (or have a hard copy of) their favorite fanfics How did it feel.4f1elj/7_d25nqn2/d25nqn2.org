When I was at summer camp years ago I found a like-minded fangirl soul and we spent a whole week making fandom references that no one around us understood. I stayed on the next week and she went home, so she sent me some printed fanfiction. Camp is great, so it's not like I needed it or even asked for it, but I just so happened to get sick the following week and that oneshot got me though a few long days at the Health Hut.
