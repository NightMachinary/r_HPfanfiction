[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium_for_the_Sleepless_Souls][Elizium for the Sleepless Souls]] by Voice of the Nephilim.

The author did such a great job of making Azkaban a terrifying place, and the mystery will keep you interested throughout the whole story. Oh, and the plot twist is awesome.
