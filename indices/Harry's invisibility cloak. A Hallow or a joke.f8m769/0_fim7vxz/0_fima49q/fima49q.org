I imagine they are all masively powerful artifacts.

the elder wand was a powerful wand that got more powerful as it was constantly used instead of being only used by one wizard

I imagine the three hallows together might give the user some power as grindalwald and young dumbledore wanted to assemble them.

but then young dumbledore could have belived in the legends of the hallows while older dumbledore is more dismissive of them
