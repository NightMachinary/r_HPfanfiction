I mean, in a strict canon sense, you're right. It's just a story attached to some old doodads that're vaguely more powerful than most others of their kind.

It is a lot more interesting if the Master of Death title actually means something though. Having it just be a hollow (heh) story is quite dull, especially with the breadth of English Historical Literature and Mythology that plays with powerful items in highly interesting ways.
