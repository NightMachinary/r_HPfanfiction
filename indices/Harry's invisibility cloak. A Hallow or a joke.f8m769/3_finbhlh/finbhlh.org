My headcanon is that Dumbledore and Moody can't see through the cloak but they can see... sense?... magic and they see the absolute void that the cloak leaves. And they then deduce that the empty space must be Harry under the cloak.

That or Dumbledore put a tracking charm on it and Moody can't see the cloak but he can see the charm attached to it.
