Sure, the versioning support isn't really what I meant, though. To be completely honest, it's literally never been useful for me.

I was more talking about being able to see what changes your Betas have made without accidentally slipping formatting changes they use to /show you/ the changes they've made into the final version, or being able to comment on every change individually, and other features like that.

To be fair, though, those are entirely up to the wrappers for Git, like GitHub or GitLab or something. But for writers.

I've just perfectly described Google Docs, haven't I? Whoops. =/
