Deathcrow I have a whole backup system for my fanfics! :) Every night I copy my whole fanfics folder onto a flash drive, then onto my sister's computer, so that I always have three up to date copies of all my stuff: flash drive, my sister's computer, and my original version on MY computer.

That way if I lose my computer somehow I'll only lose a day's worth of updated words in any situation. :)
