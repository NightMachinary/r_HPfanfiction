I wish! Imagine, everyone in the Great Hall sticks up for Remus, using the cliche where they all say they're werewolves too.

As Remus turns toward the Great Hall exit in disgrace, a single voice speaks out.

"I'm going have to leave too, because I'm a werewolf."

Ron and Hermione rise up and follow Harry in suit.

"So are we!"

/(So am I! And me! Yeah, me too!")/

Remus beams as everyone in the Great Hall erupts in applause, before quickly brushing a tear off his face.
