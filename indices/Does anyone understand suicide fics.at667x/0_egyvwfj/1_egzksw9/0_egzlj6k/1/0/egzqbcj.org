  Hermione Granger is a mess and everyone knows it. She hasn't been sober in more than a year, she's cut ties with her best friends and she spends her nights partying with everyone's favourite ex-Slytherins. Draco Malfoy has been abroad since graduating Hogwarts, studying muggle and magical healing. Upon his return, their paths intertwine and Draco can't seem to stay away.
