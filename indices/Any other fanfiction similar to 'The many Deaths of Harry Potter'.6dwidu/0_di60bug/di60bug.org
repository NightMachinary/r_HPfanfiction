Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon might fit your criteria.

It has Harry and Hermione working closely together and repeatedly going back in time should one of them die followed by repeated attempts at correcting past mistakes and new takes on canon events. Major differences would be that the time travel starts later and Harry doesn't become as morbid and/or ruthless. linkffn(6517567)
