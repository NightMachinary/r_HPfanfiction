I enjoyed it before Snape had the heart to heart with Harry. I wished the writer wouldn't have forced their hand to write it as slash :( going canon with Snape's perspective of having to go back in time constantly would have been fantastic and maybe the only change would be at the end when Harry sees Snape dying in his own blood, Snape would have included sets of memories where he time travelled so much to make sure Harry wouldn't have died
