I don't mind reading stories with romance /in/ them -- but they're a sight different than romance /genre/ stories, (which have a very specific set of conventions and plot expectations). One should not turn into the other partway through the story. It's just sloppy and infuriating and half the reason that I avoid shippy shit.
