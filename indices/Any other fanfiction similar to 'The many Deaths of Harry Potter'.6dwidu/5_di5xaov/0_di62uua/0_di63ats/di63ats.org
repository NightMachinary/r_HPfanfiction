I have definitely noticed the same thing. I just don't understand how writers can write something with a good plot, great writing, good chacterization and then completely derail all their work just for two characters to get together and start acting super OOC. They clearly understand how to write welI, but choose not to on purpose. It's really disappointing and one of the reasons why I tend to be weary of fics with any kind of romance.
