It's a good fic overall really, the slash itself is tolerable (said by someone who avoids slash like the plague) but it does fall off a bit in quality towards the end. It's a trope I've noticed in a lot of fics, when sex is introduced to the story it often loses its way a bit as far as the plot goes and it feels like the writer is pushing characters into situations rather than the characters themselves getting there.
