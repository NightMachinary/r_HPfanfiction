Do you mind slash? This fic is somewhat in a similar tone although not really that similar.

linkao3(Again and Again)

Harry keeps getting thrown back in time every time his life ends and is trying to find a way to get it to stop. Although in this fic he gets tired of looping and decides to not kill Voldemort and team up with him instead.

The summary is not very accurate. Harry isn't really evil/dark and his power and experience is well portrayed. Dumbledore bashing is not really bashing most of the time since his behavior is somewhat understandable since Harry is ignoring him and prophecy. The slash between Tom and Harry is not too bad since it's skippable and Harry ends up making him mostly sane and look more like Tom Riddle rather than Voldemort.
