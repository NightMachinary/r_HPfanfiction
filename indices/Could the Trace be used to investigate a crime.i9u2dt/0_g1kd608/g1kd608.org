As is often the case in these situations, I find the most helpful thing is to think about the Muggle equivalent.

Imagine if the government proposed placing a microphone on every child that would feed to the government certain key words which are said within the vicinity of that child. The information the government receives in the event of a "hit" against a key word is simply which key word was used and the location.

I think it's fair to say that people would be pretty nervous about this idea. In the magical world, there is perhaps sufficient justification for its existence: the danger that uncontrolled, underage magic poses to the statute of secrecy, which is the cornerstone of magical society. However, even where this level of intrusion is permitted, one imagines that people would be pretty concerned to see the system used only for its original, intended purpose.

You can imagine, over time, the Ministry attempting mission creep and trying to use the information for other things. But you can equally see people like Lucius Malfoy - who rages against the fact that the Ministry dares to enter his private property in CoS - exerting their considerable political influence to ensure that the system is not used to encroach upon their privacy.

So no, I don't think the Ministry would be permitted to "spy" on families using the Trace system. I think its use would be strictly limited to prevention of underage magic.

This type of explanation is often the answer whenever one thinks up an apparently clever use of magic to solve a societal problem. More often than not, it's a use of magic that people would very much oppose as government overreach.
