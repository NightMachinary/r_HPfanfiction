  I always wondered why the Trace didn't register or wasn't set up to alert on the unforgivables when they were used and then have a "ready" team of Aurors to immediately arrive.

Rowling never mentioned it in the books (so what I'm going to say is not really "canon"), but apparently, she later explained that the Aurors were a very small elite force, like "the few Aurors shown in the story already represent a significant portion of their force" small. Such a small force probably can't afford to put an intervention team on hold for an alert that may never ring.\\
Though the Wizarding Britain has the "Magical Patrol" that takes care of the public order and that has the effectives to intervene on such an alert (even if it may be above their pay grade).
