Ron said something about how it was a bit impossible for the Trace to affect them now that they're 17. He very quickly dismiss that as a possible way for them to be tracked

I take this as meaning that the magic for the Trace is very old and hard to change. It seems like the Trace only affects the underage and provides very limited locational data

Aurors might use a different system independent of the Trace for tracking illegal activities. The aurors responded quickly to the murder of the Riddles however. I'm not sure if this is a different system or they used the information from the Trace on Riddle
