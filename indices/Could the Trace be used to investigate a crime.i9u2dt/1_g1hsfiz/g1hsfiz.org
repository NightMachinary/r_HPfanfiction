I always wondered why the Trace didn't register or wasn't set up to alert on the unforgivables when they were used and then have a "ready" team of Aurors to immediately arrive.

Canon implies/states that the trace is more focused on muggleborn areas because they don't have to guess who may have used magic there (completely ignoring a magical showing up in that area using magic the apparating away leaving the muggleborn in trouble.)
