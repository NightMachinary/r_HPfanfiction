This is extremly hard to tell. It is too depended on what you enjoy but taking fics that are regularly recommended here are a good start. I would however take a but caution regarding the age of a fic. Also of course, many people are here so we have many different opinions. I give a few recs of mine or which I belive the sub will give.

linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) is kinda the goto fic for humours ones. Extremly well written and recommended all the time. Very enjoyable if you dont search for deep plot or complex character but rather light fun.

linkffn(Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always) is propably THE timetravle fic. Albeit a few unnessecary troopes are used it is overall a good fic.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) another timetravel, but vastly different from Backward with purpose, this fic is very AU. On of the best written fics in the fandom is wastelands and its (still ongoing) sequel a must read.

linkffn(What You Leave Behind) is a bit a preference of mine, which dosen't mean the subreddit didnt liked it. For me this is the best fic there is in the entire community it is however as good as abdonded (Newcomb claimed otherwise, but well, no update in 2 years).

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) is a bit hard for me to write here. Many people here say it starts slow but gets very good later on. I personally say this is the must overrated terrible fic out there but given many people see that different it may be something for you.

linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks) is a neat little mystery that can be read in 1-2 hours and yet gives a very heartwarming feeling.

linkffn(Cauterize) is a very beautiful oneshot about the time after the war.

Thats should give a good start.
