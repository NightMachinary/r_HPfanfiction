Is the bot dead? anyway, if it doesn't come back just google the names lol

I would recommend linkffn(The Arithmancer) as a sort-of-canon-rehash, it follows canon plot pretty closely for a while but its still good and the spell crafting is fun

linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) is a pretty good animagus!harry and it isn't used just to make Harry super powerful.

If you like D&D and crossovers, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) is one of the only D&D crossovers and is really good. It was on hiatus for like 2 years but it very recently got an update, so yay.

linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) is pretty much the best LotR crossover

linkffn(A Long Journey Home) is a good time travel story, fem!Harry goes back like 5000 years and has to live through all those years to get back to the present day.

probably linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology, or) is the best (or most popular, at least) Hermione in Slytherin

I personally haven't gotten around to reading it, but linkffn(Like a Red Headed Stepchild) is apparently really good. It's Harry but he has red hair. I'm planning on reading it soon...

Again, I haven't read it (or I started and didn't particularly like it for no particular reason) but linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) and the sequels are highly recommended by a lot of people. Its set in America and doesn't have anyone from HP but it supposedly /feels/ like HP, and from what I could tell in the few chapters I did read it seems pretty good. I might start it again later, I dunno.

linkffn(Stages of Hope) is great.

A ton of people have recommended linkffn(Cauterize) and I agree, its probably one of the best in the fandom. Definitely read.

linkffn(Grow Young With Me) is good. HP/OC muggle, post hogwarts & war.

Some would disagree, but I think linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) is pretty good. Some think its the best thing ever, some think its the worst. You just need to read it to find out.

linkffn(Core Threads) is /the/ OP Harry story. lol

IIRC linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past) is really good.

linkffn(The One He Feared) has some /really/ good fight scenes, I think.

linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them) is a fun fic of Hermione time travelling to her 2 year old body and ending the war.

Not very well known but IMO its hilarious, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Uncle of Secrets) You might need more knowledge of HP tropes though, so maybe hold out on reading it till you're more experienced in the HP fandom. IMO a lot of fics are like this, like linkffn(Seventh Horcrux), which I didn't rec because a lot of people already have, and linkffn(Potter Ever After)

linkffn(Blindness) Harry is blind but can see magic. Naturally, this leads to OP!Harry.

Honestly theres so much more than this except I kind of forget to follow or fav stories all the time soooo... ah well. At the top of the sub there should be a box in the middle saying "INTRO TO HP FANFICTION" if you haven't looked at that, do so. Also at the bottom of that intro page theres a more general recommendations page, which has a list of threads, fic lists, fics with certain ships, a ton of other stuff.
