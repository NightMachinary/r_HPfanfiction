If you want an old fandom classic to show you what can be done, I'd start with After The End.

After that, go with Northumbrian for a dose of canon compliant fluffy goodness. Great for a straight continuation of DH.

Finally, maybe go for the ultimate time-travel fix-it fic, Backwards With Purpose.

... Or, disregard all that and read the General Recommendations Thread, picking what sounds good to you. There isn't exactly a western canon of HP Fandom to give you without controversy.
