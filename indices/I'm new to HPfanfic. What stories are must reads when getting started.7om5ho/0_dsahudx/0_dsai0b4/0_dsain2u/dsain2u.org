The fic that got me interested in HP fanfics is the fully canon compliant [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867), Year 6 from Ginny's POV. It's pretty well written and has a strong canon feel.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/][FloreatCastellum]] is an excellent author focusing on canon compliant fics. Her [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]], linkffn(11419408), fills the missing Year 7 actions at Hogwarts from Ginny's POV.

For AU fics, I highly recommend the DH compliant, postwar fic [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167). Here, Harry and his friends declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot.
