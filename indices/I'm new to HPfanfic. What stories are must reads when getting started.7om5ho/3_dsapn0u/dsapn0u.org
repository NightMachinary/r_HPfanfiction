linkffn(4745329) On the Way to Greatness, if you want to read a good story where Harry was sorted into Slytherin. The author tries to write a Harry in Slytherin AU as realistically as possible, so the first few years are very close to canon (though the author kept them short), and the story starts to get really good in/after 4th year. Not that it's bad before then. One of my favourite stories.

linkao3(3390668) C'est La Vie by cywscross. Great "Harry travels to a different universe" story, very well written.

link(2680093) Circular Reasoning. A war-ridden Harry is thrown back in time and basically replaces his old self. Darker than the other two stories, but I enjoyed it a lot, and it's also well written.

linkffn(3557725) Forging the Sword. I stumbled across this story quite often before reading it, but when I did I was glad I finally did. Great characterisation, and an interesting deviation from canon.
