I really liked the story Fate by TheTrueSpartan in its beginning. It had a novel concept, it's a nice characterization of Ron, and I thought Ron's relationship with Luna and her mother was genuinely touching.

However, I think a few chapters after Ron got to Hogwarts I started thinking "hmm, this seems to be dragging a bit." So I checked the wordcount and it is 840k words. I went to the most recent published chapter and it appears the story has only gotten to second year.

I didn't bother reading after that because my gut instinct is that if a fanfic takes longer than seven canon books to get through two years then there's going to be a lot of bloat.
