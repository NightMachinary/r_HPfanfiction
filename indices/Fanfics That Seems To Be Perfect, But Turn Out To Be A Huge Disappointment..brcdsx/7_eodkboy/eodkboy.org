I remember just up and deleting "The Darkness Within" from my kindle right in the middle of a chapter, because I was so disgusted with the direction the story had taken and it was becoming painful to read. It built up so well only to completely crash and burn.

I am having a similar conflict with a fic I am reading now, The Antiheroine. It builds up so well, but somewhere around the middle you get conflicting information and direction in terms of character development and it begins to make no sense. It could have easily been solved with a Voldemort and Tom character who had mellowed in some way to still be ruthless but less psychotic, and a Harry who doesn't act like a 2 faced character so much... but it is what it is.
