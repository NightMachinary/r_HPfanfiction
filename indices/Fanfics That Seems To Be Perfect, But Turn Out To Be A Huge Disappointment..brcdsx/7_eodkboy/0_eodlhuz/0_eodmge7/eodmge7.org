It did not crash and burn (yet), but it has been a struggle to read at times. I am about 70% through. I loved most of the first part of it to be fair, it was just when Voldemort was introduced that I felt it went a bit off the rails. Without giving away too much, the story would have been so much better if Voldemort was left out entirely and only Tom existed, and the characters made their "own way" more.

Fair warning btw, its got a weird Harry/Tom/Hermione relationship I have been struggling with at times. Mentally its really well done, but it can be uncomfortable to read, especially if you dont really enjoy slash (or violence), and it can get unexpectedly descriptive. I skip some stuff if I dont like it as I am mainly reading it because it was recommended to me when I was looking for darker Hermione or Harry fics.
