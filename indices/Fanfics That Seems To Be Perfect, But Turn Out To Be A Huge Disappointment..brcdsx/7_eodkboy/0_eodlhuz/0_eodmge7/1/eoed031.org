I'm with you on your sentiments here. Voldemort is like a weird evil uncle-figure watching his niece and nephews play. I love the dynamic between Tom and Harry/Hermione. Honestly, the weird tones hit all my nasty guilty pleasures so I've been powered through it very, very slowly. Still worth a read, imo.
