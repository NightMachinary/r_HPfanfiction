The Pureblood Pretense.

The first book is pretty good, but from the second one onward it's a trainwreck. I could discount the huge (1-2k words!) rambling paragraphs, the inconsistent characterization, stilted and awkward dialogue, unrealistic teenagers (and not in a good way), the way the plot warps to increase Harry's importance, the unnecessary long-winded descriptions... I could excuse any of those things in a vacuum. But the problem is, they all compound together, making the reading experience miserable. I caught myself actually becoming angry, as I really wanted to read this.

The story would shine with a good editor that would prune like 40% of it and increase the slice of life content.
