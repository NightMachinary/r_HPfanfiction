Aww, that's one of my favorite fics. Plot warping to increase Harry's importance usually bother me, but doesn't in this fic for some reason. Unrealistic teenagers doesn't really bother me much since I don't really want to read the conversations or thought processes of actual 11 year olds. I don't really recall the dialogue being that stilted and awkward though, certainly not compared to some other fics I've tried to read, and given up on as the dialogue was horrendous. I'm usually not really a fan of tons of slice of life stuff, so gonna have to disagree there too.
