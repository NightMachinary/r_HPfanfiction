If someone took Rowling's work and published it for free even under some other name, it would be piracy which is punishable by law.

Every fanfiction author uses her world, her heroes and publishes his/her work under another name - it is plagiarism. The main thing is every reader knows the original author (it is the only reason they are reading the story).

If someone copied an unfinished work, continued it and became more popular - first of all it's a lesson for the first author. In fanfiction readers don't care about it, they are here for the stories that use another work by definition.

If an author wants true attention, then he/she should write originals.
