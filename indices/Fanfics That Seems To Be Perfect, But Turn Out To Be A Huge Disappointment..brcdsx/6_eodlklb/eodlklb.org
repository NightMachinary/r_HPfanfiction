The Darkness Within is written by a plagiarist who stole the opening chapters verbatim from another fanfic author. I believe the chapters in question were later rewritten to paraphrase rather than copy word for word, but are nonetheless a scene for scene clone of Project Dark Overlord's fic.

It remains a black mark on the HP fanfic community that the product of plagiarism received so large a following. But I suppose in the game of stealing other people's ideas, you win or you die.
