A lot of these stories are based on not meeting expectations. I typically always go into a story expecting the worst tropes and zero originality---and therefore rarely get disappointed. Take the Darkness Within---I never expected a ‘good Voldemort' because it never occurred to me at the time that he could be good (I was still a new reader, just venturing into AU territory). As such, I considered the ‘plot twist' just a logical step which I could see coming from far away rather than a surprise that detracted from the originality.

I'm not sure how it is for everyone else but I sort of go through "cycles." By that I mean in some weeks I enjoy tragic stories, in others I won't read anything but fluff. Sometimes I only look for fem!Harry, other times I skip anything that isn't canon-compliant. I believe that my bookmarks contain almost 50 fics that I have never read. At the time, I wasn't in the right mood for it---and I knew it---so I didn't even try to read it. At the same time, I recognized it as a good story (probably) and so I kept it to read later. Many of the stories posted here have been on that list at some point. How is this relevant? Well, I think it determines what expectations you have. Some days, I just want a serious dark fic---and no matter how funny it is, a crack fic will not satisfy me. The same goes to most of these stories---they're a disappointment because you were hoping for something else, and didn't get it. To you it would be disappointing, but to others, that could be ‘the perfect fic' which they were looking for.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that this topic is completely subjective (much more so than many other topics I've come across on this sub) and the fact that someone out there found such-and-such to be disappointing doesn't mean you will. If you came to this post looking for fics to avoid, I'd advise you to give them a try anyways. Chances are, you'll probably agree with them---but then again, you might find it to be the perfect fic. It all depends on what you expect the story to be.

I honestly don't see how this post will be helpful, except as a dumping site for arguments and personal frustrations.

(I don't know where I was going with this comment but since I wrote this much already, I might as well post it. Please don't downvote me into oblivion.)
