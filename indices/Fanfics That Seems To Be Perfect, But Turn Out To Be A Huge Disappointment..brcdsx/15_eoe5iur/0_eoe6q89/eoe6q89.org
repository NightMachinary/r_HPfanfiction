Who would downvote you into oblivion...? The other way around, thank you for sharing your thoughts.

And You are right that this topic is subjective, and is absolutely NOT posted for finding fics to avoid :) Yes, I might find Darkness Within and Twins disappointing, while others might find it briliant.

The point of this topic is to write about our subjective disappointments. Everybody describes their experiences, so I think this post might be somehow helpful .

And, personal frustrations are welcomed too :)

BTW- your approach- not expecting much, is cool - it can really help avoiding disappointments. The worst you can do is expecting a golden mountain from a fic :)
