HPMOR I think counts.

After some consideration, my opinion on HPMOR is that it's not the gospel that its supporters think it is nor is it the garbage its detractors think it is, but simply just a mediocre fanfiction. The biggest reason I think it deserves mockery is because the author wanted it to win a Hugo, but on its own merits it's just a mediocre HP fanfiction after the first 30 chapters or so.

The first 30 chapters are pretty okay (if you ignore the scene where Draco talks about wanting to rape Luna), since they've got the cool premise of a scientifically minded Harry discovering new spells, but then spell creation all but vanishes for tedious rip-offs of Ender's Game and an Azkaban break in with no real consequences. The last 10 chapters are quite epic. Everything in between is meh, as the fic doesn't stick to the premise of discovery like at all and the author takes a bit too much joy in mocking Rowling's world.

I will say this, it probably counts as a Super!Harry story but one that still keeps him within realistic limits. If you look it as a self-insert Super!Harry, it's one of the better ones out there because Harry ends up with meaningful limitations.

That said, I can't say how much of my opinion has been colored by its unofficial sequel, Significant Digits, which is (IMO) better than HPMOR.
