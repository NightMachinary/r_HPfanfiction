Chapter 74 is fine, it's the 8 chapters ahead of it that could easily be a fraction as long and still make the same points. The fic has many epic moments separated by long forgettable stretches.

That's why I don't think length should be counted as a factor in whether a fanfic is actually "good". It depends on what fills that length.
