I agree with most of your points, but there is one line I'd like to contest:

#+begin_quote
  Apart from anything else, it manages to wrap up every single plotline from the entire series in one year. That is not the work of a mediocre fanfic.
#+end_quote

I think this really was just an artistic choice that will be viewed as good or bad depending on the reader's opinion of the fanfic. I *personally* think shoving an expy of Ender's Game, an Azkaban breakout, a Wizengamot trial, SP(H)EW, and the defeat of Voldemort into /one year/ strains credibility and is a convenient handwave to avoid character growth by claiming that all the events only happened in one year and therefore "Harry" had little time to mature. Put it this way: a technically correct rewording of your statement is that it took 800k words to get through 1 year, which if I recall correctly is about or more than the words it takes to get through all 7 of the canon books.

I don't want to start a fight, but I think if you had said that it manages to wrap up all its plotlines in 800k words, your statement would not seem as impressive.
