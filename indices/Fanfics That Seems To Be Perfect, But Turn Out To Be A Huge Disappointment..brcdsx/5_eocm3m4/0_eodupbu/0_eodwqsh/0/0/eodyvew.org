I don't necessarily disagree. In terms of proper pacing of the story it's definitely rushed, with many things squished in, to the point of, as you pointed out, it streching the suspension of disbelief a bit (though that aspect of the fic is hardly the worst offender of that crime, and the bit to try and cover those sorts of holes [namely Dumbledore's final reveal] is I suppose effective in that, but it in and of itself causes issues precisely because of how convenient it is).

But IIRC, the author explicitly stated that their goal was to resolve every single plotline in one year. So my statement is not "it is a great achievement in smooth, well planned, and well paced writing" so much as it is "the author went out to try to fit an enormous amount of plots, conflicts and resolutions in a (relatively) very narrow window of time, and managed to do so while having a coherent and at least somewhat interesting overarching plot."
