Yeah, I agree. Reading it requires not taking it too seriously (along the lines of 80s actions movies, where you don't think about how, for example, the fancy sciency mumbo jumbo they throw out doesn't actually make cohesive sense it you look close enough at it) but I think calling it mediocre fanfiction does it a disservice. The author himself didnt do it any favors with his conduct and that has become somewhat inextricable from the work itself. (Even regardless of the very Author-Expy nature of the protagonist)

Apart from anything else, it manages to wrap up every single plotline from the entire series /in one year/. That is not the work of a mediocre fanfic.

(All that being said, I do find it difficult to recommend precisely because of the baggage and the explanations and caveats that have to be added to that recommendation.)
