I'm higher on HPMOR than most of this sub. Part of it's that many of the criticisms are perfectly valid and just didn't bother me. The 11-year-olds acting entirely unlike 11-year-olds, for instance.

That said, I think it deserves points beyond "just mediocre fanfiction" on grounds that it does genuinely novel and interesting things that you don't see across the other... /checks ffn/... 800k fics. If you're going to do things better, you're going to have to do them differently, and if you're doing things differently, some things are going to go wrong because most changes aren't improvements because the status quo got to where it was by several generations iteration. I can tolerate doing some things badly if it means I can appreciate things done exceptionally well.
