Both times I tried reading/listening to HPMOR, I dropped out around the Azkaban stuff. It could have been a chapter or two long, but instead we got 11 chapters plus 3 aftermath ones, and it was so damn tedious I gave up. I wanted more science Harry experimenting with magic and instead I got an endless pseudo philosophical diatribe about death with some lacklustre tension thrown in for far too long.
