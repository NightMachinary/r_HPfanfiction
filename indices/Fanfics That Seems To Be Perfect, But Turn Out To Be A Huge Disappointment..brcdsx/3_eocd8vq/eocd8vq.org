The fifth Element, by bexis.

I know some people don't like it because it gets long and wordy, but I thought it was AMAZING. Up until the way it ended basically on an cliff hanger with no resolution. With the amount of time and the length of it and creativity the author put in, he could have found a way to actually resolve the Harry vs Voldemort conflict, instead of just quitting. Given that the author spent many years writing this, it's not surprising he ran out of steam and energy for it. But at the same time, I was expecting some sort of resolution at the end and never got it.

Boooooo.
