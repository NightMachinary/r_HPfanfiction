I really liked the series when I first read it, mostly for the dark side - aside of the traditions and rituals, I loved how alien their mindsets seemed, when compared to regular people - there it is, a civilization that broke itself from nonmagicals, evolved differently, and whose people were absolutely different from the canon nonmagicals, and I could support the dark side since trying to push the two civilizations together again just made no sense.. Even Draco'd behavior and possessiveness worked into that, I just tossed it on the alien wayof thinking and went with that.

But then a few years later I tried to read it again, and...cringe. Though I thik it was mostly my way of thinking that changed after reading much more fanfiction, I just couldn't handle that much self-sacrifice as Harry had, again xD;
