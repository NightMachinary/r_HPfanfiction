The Saving Connor series. I really liked the depth that she used to write with, the fight scenes, the realisticness of what the war was like, not the watered down version of the books, the rituals, traditions and such. I know its the typical wrong boy who lived premise, with parents/Albus /Gryffindors abusing Harry, and Snape/Slytherins are of course the good guys in all of it.

ButI hated how she wrote Draco and Connor. Both are the same person, one is a Gryffindor and the other a Slytherin. Both selfish brats and both very unrealistic actions/feelings towards Harry. Connor is throwing away his only friend and brother on the say so of Ron, a boy he's know for less than 12 hours and Draco just acting moronic, acting as if Harry is his puppy. Several times I expected him to pat Harry's head and say "good boy" to him. I was able to get through 5 1/2 of the books, and would eventually like to finish, but...
