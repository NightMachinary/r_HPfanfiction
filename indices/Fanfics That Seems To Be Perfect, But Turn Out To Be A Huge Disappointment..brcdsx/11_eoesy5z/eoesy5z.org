Okay, "Perfect" would be a stretch but linkffn(Partially Kissed Hero) starts out as a really interesting story with afaics a unique central plot point. After a few chapters it becomes page after page of the author banging on about some theory he has that's been the root of a disagreement on some forum somewhere. I made it to chapter 42 (out of 103).
