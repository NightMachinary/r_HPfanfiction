This isn't about how flawed you believe Dumbledore & Co. to be. Unless---as I wrote---this is a Bizzaroverse-level AU, Voldemort has no redeeming traits. In canon, one of his last acts was to murder his most loyal servant (he thought) in cold blood for nothing more than a slight gain in magical power. How could such a man resist the temptation to tamper with Harry's mind?

There are stories in which evil triumphs. They are called "tragedies". But what you seem to be looking for is a celebration of evil.
