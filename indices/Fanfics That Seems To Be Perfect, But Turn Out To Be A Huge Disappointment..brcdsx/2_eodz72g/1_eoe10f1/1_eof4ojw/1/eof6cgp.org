I'm sorry, I shouldn't have started this discussion in the first place. This is my first post ever or any forum, in my life. I'm no good in disscussions so I shouldn't have started it.

I just thought that Reddit community is more like ffn/AO3 communities, where such a great part of the fics is dark side-oriented.

I don't want to fight with anybody. Harry Potter stories are just fiction, something created to entertain and help us relax. Nobody should get heated up aout them.

​

Therefore, I'm sorry.
