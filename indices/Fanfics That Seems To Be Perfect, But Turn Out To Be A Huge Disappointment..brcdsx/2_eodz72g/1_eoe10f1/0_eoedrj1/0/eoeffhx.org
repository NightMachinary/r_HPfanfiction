Well it is very black and white (and kinda childish) in the beginning , but later- I would say it gets rather grey.

Voldemort has virtues.

1. He doesn't act out of selfish motives. His goal is to revolutionize the Wizarding World.

2. He abolishes anti-creatures laws, like for example the Werewolves Acts enforced by Umbridge.

3. When somebody becomes his follower - he cares about them. I've once read a nice quote - Dumbledore and Voldemort both treat people like their tools, but Voldemort - unlike Dumbledore - takes a good care of his tools, to make sure they serve him better and longer.

4. Unlike Dumbledore, he is honest and transparent towards both his enemies and followers. He doesn't need to lie or manipulate. He is intimidating enough. Dumbledore grooms and manipulates people, to make them useful to him (Harry, Snape, Remus etc) which in my opinion is far more disgusting than what Voldemort does.

5. He is believed to be unable of feelings, but Bella and Delphi prove otherwise.

6. And let's not forget, that Voldemort has been abused and neglected, and left to rot in the Muggle orphanage for so many years.

   Really please don't hate me, but I really dislike labeling (good/evil, black/white). I like to notice flaws AND virtues in everybody.
