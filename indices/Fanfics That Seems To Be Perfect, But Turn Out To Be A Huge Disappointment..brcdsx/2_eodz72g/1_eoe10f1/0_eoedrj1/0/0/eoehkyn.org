  He doesn't act out of selfish motives. His goal is to revolutionize the Wizarding World.
#+end_quote

Isn't his end goal to become the tyrannical, immortal ruler of the Wizarding world?

And isn't his revolution's purpose to purge muggleborns and muggle-lovers?

  When somebody becomes his follower - he cares about them. I've once read a nice quote - Dumbledore and Voldemort both treat people like their tools, but Voldemort - unlike Dumbledore - takes a good care of his tools, to make sure they serve him better and longer.

He cares about Peter so much he mocks him after Peter is in pain from self-amputating his hand to resurrect Voldemort.

He casts Crucio on his followers when they displease him.

The Malfoy's clearly aren't too happy about how Tom was treating Draco, either.

Wow, he really treated his tools well. So well that Narcissa betrayed him and allowed Harry's resurrection to go unnoticed. Really took care of his tools there lol. They sure served him well.

  Unlike Dumbledore, he is honest and transparent towards both his enemies and followers. He doesn't need to lie or manipulate. He is intimidating enough. Dumbledore grooms and manipulates people, to make them useful to him (Harry, Snape, Remus etc) which in my opinion is far more disgusting than what Voldemort does.

Isn't the whole 5th book Voldemort lying to Harry and manipulating him to get to the prophecy?

Isn't young Tom Riddle shown to have manipulated the entire school during his time there, even getting an innocent student (Hagrid) expelled?

Voldemort literally murders people. He murdered a young girl at Hogwarts.

Dumbledore didn't even murder Grindelwald, who was up until Voldemort came around the worst Dark wizard in Europe. I don't buy DD actions being worse than Voldemort's at all.

  And let's not forget, that Voldemort has been abused and neglected, and left to rot in the Muggle orphanage for so many years.
#+end_quote

He also abused and bullied the other children at the orphanage.

I don't hate you, but I do think this take is really strange.

Though for someone who purports to see the good and bad in everyone I get the sense that you're not exactly giving Dumbledore a fair shake.
