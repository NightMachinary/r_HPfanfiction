Yes, because inheriting Magic was based on science, genetics. Magic was inherited by genes just like the ability to roll your tongue or your eye color. Mating with Muggles / Muggleborns watered down the magical genes pool. Muggles outnumbered Wizards and Witches like a bilion times- and Voldemort was afraid of the Ability of performing Magic is going to go extinct. I won't go deep into genetic crosses etc but this is the entire foundation of the Blood Supermacy in HP. I've read this in multiple sources. I dunno if the scientific theory Voldemort believed it is credible/correct or not, but the fact is that he didn't get his ideas from nowhere.

​

Yes, I absolutely agree that he didn't always treat his fllowers fairly - but he couldnt have been a d-ck for them always, because he wouldn't have had any followers at all . We have examples of him caring for his followers, like releasing them out of jail, letting them stay at the Riddle Manor at first and at Malfoy Manor later. He also saved Barty from his imprisonment under the Imperius Curse. And he made a new arm for Peter :P

​

I know he did kill people. This is not my point. Look- when Voldemort kills somebody, he is a heartless monster. When a person like Molly Weasley kills a person without any trace of guilt, remorse, anything - she is a hero.

The same goes for deceptions, lies, manipulations. Dumbledore does that all the time throughout the 7 books and in the past, and not even once is called out on it (maybe once by Aberforth). DD did disgusting things, and he is still considered a flawless, golden hero. This is hurtful.

​

Yes, he bullied kids in the orphanage. Also, he's been through so much, that probably his feelings and perception are messed up. I've spent 5 years in a youth work camp in the western europe. I have anxiety and ptsd. It just works that way.

​

And here I agree 100%. I should start noticing virues also in Dumbledore. I'm probably biased and I'm sorry.
