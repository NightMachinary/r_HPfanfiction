Wow we have extremely different interpretations of canon.

For example I see Voldemort as being 100% selfish, in that he didn't care about revolutionizing the wizarding world at all, he just wanted to rule it because he was an egomaniac and hated muggles because he grew up as a psychopath in a shitty orphanage. Plus I see him as having treated all his followers terribly, by torturing them for the slightest disappointment, and definitely not giving a shit about any of them as people. Where as I view Dumbledore as caring very deeply about all of his followers, and not particularly lying or being manipulative very often.

Note I'm not saying your interpretation is wrong by the way, just saying we interpreted things very differently.
