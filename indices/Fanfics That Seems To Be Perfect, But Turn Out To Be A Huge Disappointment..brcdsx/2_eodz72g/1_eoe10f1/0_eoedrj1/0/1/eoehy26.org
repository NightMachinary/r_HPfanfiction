Here are rebuttals to your points.

1. By killing the impure, because of his childhood. Causing change for change's sake is not a virtue.
2. While also creating anti-Muggleborn laws, showing that he values the lives of muggleborns below that of werewolves. This is only virtuous if you judge his actions on the basis of virtue alone while ignoring that he liberated the werewolves for non-virtuous purposes.
3. Abandons Quirrel to burn to death at Harry's hands. Was going to eat Ginny's soul after essentially child-grooming her. Makes Pettigrew's hand strangle him once he shows mercy.
4. Didn't tell any of the Death Eaters that he was a half-blood therefore his entire platform was based on a lie. Puppeted the Ministry instead of outright declaring himself ruler of Wizarding Britain. Child-groomed Ginny.
5. You can have sex and a kid without loving the woman or the kid. For example, Tom Riddle Sr.
6. Harry Potter was abused and neglected and didn't turn into a mass-murdering psychopath.

In summary, I do not believe that your points align with the events of the books.
