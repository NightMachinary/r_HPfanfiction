1-2 about the science and genetics of blood in HP please read above... And I don't say the Blood Purity Science is correct, but this is where Voldemort took his ideas from.

1. Yes, this all is correct and I agree.

4.Yes, this is also 100% true. He did lie about his blood status.

1. Him loving Bella and Delphini is actually canon. It's on Wiki/Pottermore.

6.About this, also please look above.

In summary, my point is not to purify Voldemort of all bad things he's done. He is the villain of the series and I'm aware of it. However, I'd like to put it into some context and perspective. I only want to show, that the golden "good guys" - especially Dumbledore - are not so flawless either, but everybody seems to fail to notice it.
