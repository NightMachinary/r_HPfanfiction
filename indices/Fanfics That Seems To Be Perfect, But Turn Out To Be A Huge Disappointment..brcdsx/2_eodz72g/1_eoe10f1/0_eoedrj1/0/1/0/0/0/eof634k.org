"Bellatrix Lestrange was among Voldemort's most loyal and trusted [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Eaters][Death Eaters]]. She was entrusted with [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Helga_Hufflepuff%27s_Cup][one of his Horcruxes]], even though she was kept unaware of what it really was, and stored it in her [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Gringotts_Wizarding_Bank][Gringotts]] [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Lestrange_Vault][vault]]. She was fanatically loyal to her master as, after his first defeat in [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/1981][1981]], she did not join many of her fellow Death Eaters in denying their association with him. Instead, she proudly declared that she remained his most loyal servant and that he would surely return. She considered Azkaban a place where she could wait for him, rather than a prison.

Her obsession extended to her being in love with and sexually attracted to him. On at least one occasion, during a meeting of his Death Eaters at Malfoy Manor, her face flushed and her eyes welled up with tears when he praised her.

He did seem to consider her of greater importance than most of his other servants. He may have had at least a superficial affection for her, as he would call her "Bella" like other members of her family would. He seemed to be flattered by her unfaltering devotion as he praised her, along with her [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Rodolphus_Lestrange][husband]] and [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Rabastan_Lestrange][brother-in-law]] during his rebirth and promised that she would be rewarded; Snape later mentions that despite this he was more impressed by Snape's many years of useful information than Bellatrix's devotion however. At the conclusion of the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries][Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], he grabbed her and Apparated away with her; she was the sole Death Eater who he bothered to help, though this may have been more due to her closer proximity rather than preferential treatment. When she was killed by [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Molly_Weasley][Molly Weasley]] during the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts][Battle of Hogwarts]], he was furious, and intended to avenge her death when Harry intervened.

Although Bellatrix was married to one of Voldemort's other loyal Death Eaters, [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Rodolphus_Lestrange][Rodolphus Lestrange]], the union seemed to be nothing more than a business-like partnership. It was Voldemort to whom she spoke in a romantic manner. She was outraged by anyone showing him the slightest disrespect. When [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Harry_Potter][Harry Potter]] called him by his name in [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/1996][1996]], she became enraged, due to feeling that he was unworthy of speaking the name.

Unknown to nearly all, it would be revealed years later after their death that Bellatrix and Voldemort had in fact engaged in a sexual relationship, resulting in the birth of their daughter [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Delphini][Delphini]] who, years later, threatened to upset the timeline to be with her father. As Voldemort believed that he could cheat death, through his Horcruxes, he probably did not feel a need to leave a child behind as an heir. It is highly likely that he used the relationship with Bellatrix as a way to reward her for her undying loyalty to him, and for her rather potent and notable successes as his most loyal lieutenant. However, a reward appears to be unlikely considering Bellatrix's failures at the Ministry. "
