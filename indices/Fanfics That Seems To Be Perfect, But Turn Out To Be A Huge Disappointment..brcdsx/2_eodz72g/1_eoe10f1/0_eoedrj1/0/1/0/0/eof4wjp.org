  1. Him loving Bella and Delphini is actually canon. It's on Wiki/Pottermore.

Quote and link, please. I've actually looked at the article on Voldemort, and it was explicit about his not loving Bellatrix.

Also, I think that most of the fandom doesn't consider Cursed Child to be canon, not least because it wasn't written by JKR.
