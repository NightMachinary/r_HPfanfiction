Errr.... no.

Not the "story of redemption and a happy ending", but an average, mediocre story. This story was so exceptional and extraordinary exactly because Voldemort, Bella and Lucius were shown in this light. Turning Harry against them and showing the so-called "good guys" as golden flawless heroes again robbed the fancic of its originality.

Besides... er...violent psychopath? Is it just me, or the storyline of HP is not exactly black/white (at least not since the Goblet of Fire timeline). Bella and Lucius are characters with flaws and virtues. So is Voldemort.

And the other one- yes, it's exctly that. Only I expected that it is going to develop into something more, while it didn't.
