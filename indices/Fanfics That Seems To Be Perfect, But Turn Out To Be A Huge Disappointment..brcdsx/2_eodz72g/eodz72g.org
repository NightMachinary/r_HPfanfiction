I haven't read either of these two, but judging from your summaries, I am not surprised.

Unless it's a Bizzaro-world AU, Voldemort is still evil, and so are his followers. It doesn't matter how affable, affectionate, and supportive Voldemort happens to act towards the protagonist. Voldemort is still a violent psychopath who committed multiple murders to extend his own life and plans to commit genocide and establish a reign of terror; and Bellatrix and Lucius are there with him every step of the way. Why is it so surprising that Voldemort tried to brainwash Harry? In fact, Harry turning against Voldemort would be a story of redemption, and a happy ending.

As for the second one, it sounds like an unusually well-written Uber!Harry WBWL Potters/Dumbledore-bashing fic. It's the subgenre that distils the directionless and self-absorbed adolescent rage against authority into prose. What /did/ you expect?

On my end, Slytherin!Hermione fics tend to start strong and then disappoint. They tend to be ruined by pointlessly bashing Dumbledore and Gryffindors in general.

- There's /Mudsnake/, where you have a brilliant and powerful (whatever that means), yet profoundly messed up student showing up at Hogwarts out of the Muggle world and being sorted into Slytherin. Remind you of anyone? It would certainly remind Dumbledore of his second greatest failure.

  What would he do? Would he try to preemptively cripple this prodigy, to prevent another Tom Riddle? Would he try to instill in her the caution about imposing his will on others---that he himself has had to learn the hard way? Or, perhaps, teach her to fear of her own power, like he fears his own? Would he try to recruit her as an ally---perhaps an eventual successor, since Voldemort would be a common enemy? Or, would that be risking replacing one tyrant with another?

  What he actually does is stick lemon drops in his ears and dance around singing La-La-La. Because that's the kind of fic this is.

- Someone else has mentioned /Anti-Heroine/. Hermione is orphaned and grows up on the street, and is a scrappy badass by the time she gets her Hogwarts letter. She is sorted into Slytherin. Sounds like a recipe for interesting conflict and adversity, no? But Draco is suddenly friendly, and the worst enemy is IneptlyManipulative!Dumbledore; and Hermione is slavishly protective of Harry (also in Slytherin) for no clear reason. I am told that later on, the fic turns into porn in which Hermione is a sexual submissive to Diary!Tom.

- Less of a disappointment, but still a significant one, is /Mudblood Mistress/. It starts out well, doesn't get bogged down, and doesn't bash; but Hermione quickly becomes unrecognisable in personality---impulsive and not thoughtful at all---and in the latest volume, she becomes convinced that the Death Eaters will accept her if she tries to join them. She does so after deciding that the "good guys" aren't treating her as special as she deserves, even though Dumbledore himself has been giving her private lessons for /years/. However, at least it turns out that Death Eaters want to kill her after all, so it's better than nothing.
