And adressing the stories You've mentioned, all three sound interesting.

1. The first one sounds most thrilling of the all, but Dumbledore is -sadly- often a person to figuratively sit and stick lemond drops into his ears instead of acting... :P
2. The beginning sounds lit. And it really seems like crush and burn later. Pity.
3. Hermione is clearly unfit to be a Death Eater, even fanfic with her accepted among their ranks wouldn't be much fun...
