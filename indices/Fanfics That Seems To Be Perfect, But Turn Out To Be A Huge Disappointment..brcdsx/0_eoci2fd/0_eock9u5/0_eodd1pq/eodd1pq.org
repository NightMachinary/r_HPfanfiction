That's how he ends all of his series. He obviously has no real idea how to end anything. When the end comes, and everything matters, he just flips a switch and gives up on them. I've been under the assumption he does it to pull a Rain Johnson.

He somehow causes the Big Bang at the end of one story, or he gets cheated on or sent away from everything by his allies at the end of others. None of it really makes any sense. Of course, you have to get past the part where Harry is fucking teenagers first though.
