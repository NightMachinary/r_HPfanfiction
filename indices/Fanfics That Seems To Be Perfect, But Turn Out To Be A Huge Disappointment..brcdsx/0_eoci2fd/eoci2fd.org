Darth Marrs often shoots himself into the foot with some ridiculous developments and mar his otherwise great premises. "Firebird Trilogy" and "The Stars Alone" are such examples. "The Bonds of Blood" has a great first half, and some very lousy second half plots.

"The Voyage of Starship Hedwig" has a very interesting premise and some great ideas, only to end up as a ridiculous and abandoned Star Wars crossover.

The last third of "A Cadmean Victory" is ridiculous.

Brennus rushed the conclusion of "Hail Odysseus" just when things got interesting.

"Here and There" is easily the best femslash I've read if not for the stupidly overpowered Greyback in the last few chapters.

"Lady Archimedes" could be a lot better if it deviates from canon more and has good guys fighting more effectively earlier.

The extremely promising "Innocent series" inexplicably starts rehashing canon plots. Very disappointed.

Similar, the great Ginny story "The Changeling" also sticks way too close to canon stations.
