Yep. The story would've been intact if they'd just aged the characters up, too, given how competent they are. There are already so many changes to canon that it wouldn't be that much of a stretch to make Hogwarts acceptance be at 16. Just handwave accidental magic as being weaker until adulthood.

That said, 16 is still absurdly young and still inappropriate but it's common enough in YA literature to imply that the characters will be intimate and then cut away, which is the treatment Firebird takes for the most part.
