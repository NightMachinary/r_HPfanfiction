I actually loved The Darkness Within. Yes I hated what Moody and Dumbledore did, but personally I see Dumbledore as a terribly misguided character in canon. Also, while Harry does go destroy the horcruxes, he does it out of revenge towards Voldemort for manipulating him and lying to him. He ONLY wants to destroy the horcruxes, not actually kill Voldemort. That happens unintentionally on Harry's part.
