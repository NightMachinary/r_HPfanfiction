I agree, but look... Voldemort has raised Harry, provided him with the best level of care and education and genuinely treated him like his own son. Yes, he lied to him, and implemented these false memories (which in my opinion was pointless anyway) , but nevertheless he was a good Father for Harry for so many years. James on the other hand, literally abducted him and kept him a prisoner.

I know Harry had his revenge on James because he has beaten James up, but he has ONLY beaten him up, while with Voldemort... Harry directly has taken actions that led to his death.

And that is understandable that You love this story, because this story is definitely extraordinarily good and interesting to a certain degree. I only say that in my opinion the plot twist is really disappionting and makes this story... mediocre.
