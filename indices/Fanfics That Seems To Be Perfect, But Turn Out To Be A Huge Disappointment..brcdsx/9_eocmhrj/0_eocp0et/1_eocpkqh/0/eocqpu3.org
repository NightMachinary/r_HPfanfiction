Yes, that's true. please, I don't want to fight.

Only, all the way up to the plot twist, I have been convinced that Harry hate James, Lily and Sirius so much, because they have abducted him, locked him up, imprisoned him, kept him away from his loved ones, and literally done everything against his will, like sending him to Hogwarts.

These are credible, believable, strong reasons to hate somebody. Viciously and beyond measure. These reasons were enough. The plot twist was unnecessary.
