Agreed. And even Harry sees that I think. As the series goes on, he realizes that Dumbledore is human and has flaws. It's just that his are of a darker nature.

Oh yeah. And I tend to avoid OP characters in fanfic. I just feel that if someone is OP, they simple aren't challenged and it's not entertaining. It's part of the reason I prefer Batman over Superman. Though Bats gets OPed too.
