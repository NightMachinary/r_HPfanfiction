Yes, that's so true - Dumbledore was manipulating both sides in this fic and it was actually amazingly written, because the Author managed to make him very, very In Character - manipulative, ruthless man, who pretends to be a lenient compassionate Grandfather.

In the Canon his actions are kinda similar... grooming minors to bend them to his will, and don't get any repercussions for that.

Yes, Harry was an overpowered character in this fic, and sometimes it felt out of the place... When he used the shuriken and other ninja tools, I thought at first this fic is a kind of a Naruto crossover :)))
