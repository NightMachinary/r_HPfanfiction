I had exactly the same impression, and I think many people had. Reading the series as a kid - you admire Dumbledore, a wise, old Wizard who even reminds Gandalf. Re-reading it as a grown-up/teenager - you start noticing how much of an a-hole he really was. Dumbledore is one of my least favorite characters in the franchize.
