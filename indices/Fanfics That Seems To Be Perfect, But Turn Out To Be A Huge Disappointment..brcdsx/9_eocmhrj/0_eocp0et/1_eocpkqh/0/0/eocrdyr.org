I'm not trying to fight either. I hate it when people can't have a civil debate over things.

Ok I see your point there. I just got the feeling in the beginning that he hated those three more than everyone else, even though it was clear (to me at least) that Dumbledore was pulling to strings and that James, Lily, and Sirius didn't really want to keep him locked up.

Though I agree that the whole locking him in Hogwarts was kinda pointless. I felt that Dumbledore didn't get any repercussions for his actions against a minor, and that it was kinda blown over. He, for all intents and purposes, kidnapped him and held him prisoner.

Also, I did feel that Harry was more than a little OP in this fic. I don't really like the whole “restrictions on magical core” stuff or whatever it was in in this case that made him super powerful.
