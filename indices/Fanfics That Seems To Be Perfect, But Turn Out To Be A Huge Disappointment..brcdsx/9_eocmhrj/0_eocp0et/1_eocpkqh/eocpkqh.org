While Voldemort was a good father, he only did it because he wanted something from Harry. That's why Harry was so mad.

Harry actually had an entire plot to kill James. He would've succeeded if not for chance (I don't remember the exact plot it's been a while since I read it).

To me, the plot twist was gonna be there at some point. Because there was some reason that Harry specifically hated Lily James and Sirius beyond anyone else. If you read the sequel to this fic, it actually explains more about what Voldemort did while easing Harry and just how much a manipulate a-hole he was.
