One important thing to note: just because the memories were false, doesn't mean they didn't happen.

As I remember, all of Harry's memories of abusive!lily and James and sirius and remus had literally and physically happened to harry, but lily james sirius and remus were lucius and other death eaters poly juiced, and the memories were only altered so as to fill in any gaps (like the environment and such.) Voldemort deliberately made his death eaters abuse Harry under false identities to create the memories needed to alienate him from his parents.

And that's not even touching on how drawn out the 'reveal' was. The only reason it takes that long to get there is because of the characters total inability to talk to each other.

Not to say that having a reveal drawn out is bad writing per se, but the method through with the author accomplishes it leaves a lot to be desired.

However much I dislike those plot decisions, I do actually like the story, and have it backed up in case the author ever deletes it, and I think there's a lot of good things going for it.
