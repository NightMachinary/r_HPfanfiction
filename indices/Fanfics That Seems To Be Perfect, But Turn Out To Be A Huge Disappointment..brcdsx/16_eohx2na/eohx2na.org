Everyone has already mentioned The Darkness Within, which I still enjoy but can acknowledge it's second half and sequels are pretty mediocre at best, but I'm gonna throw a dark horse out there.

I haven't seen a single person talk about the disappointment that is The Augurey linkffn(12310861). Such an amazing premise cut down at the knees by weak writing and bad characterization. It starts off pretty well enough, Harry finds out Delphini exists and adopts her as his daughter. But as time goes on, it becomes clear that the author cares infinitely more about a romantic plot between Harry and Hermione, and believes that Hermione is literally the greatest character to grace modern fiction. Harry is degraded into a man who literally has zero thought processes in his mind and literally attacks people for no reason, and Hermione is praised as a woman who's always right and can literally do no wrong. When I dropped it around chapter 26 or so, after Harry literally punched Draco in his own home for literally no reason at all, Delphini hadn't been featured for at least almost ten chapters, and the story had degraded to your typical HP/HG romance.
