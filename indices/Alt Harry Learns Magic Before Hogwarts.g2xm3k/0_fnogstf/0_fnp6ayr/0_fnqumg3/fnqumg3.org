Sounds good, a bit more appropriate to canon. Although, that wasn't my aim (also I don't know Pathfinder all that well). I openly admitted that Divine Soul Sorcerer would be more accurate due to flavor text.

I was going on the assumption that this all works because Harry /thinks/ it works, after some accidental magic that he misidentifies as from DnD. If Harry's belief helps shape this then you have to consider what he /thinks/ he is, not what he /actually/ is.

Sorcerer because his magic must be innate. But you could go for some flavours of Warlock, Priest, Druid, or even Bard if you really wanted to be different.

Shadow Magic because of his dark cupboard, although you could go for Draconic Bloodline or Wild Magic.

Human was the race of choice because nearly all the others can be discarded by checking his skin colour. Although that doesn't discount the possibility of being a Half-Elf, a really short Goliath, a Changeling, or any number of things under the effects of a spell such as True Polymorph.
