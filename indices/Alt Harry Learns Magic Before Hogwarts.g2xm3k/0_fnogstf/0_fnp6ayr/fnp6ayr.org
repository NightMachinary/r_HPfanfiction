If we're going off anachronistic systems, I'll point out that Pathfinder has a class called Arcanist, which is basically someone who was born with a Sorcerer's inborn magical ability... who then studied magic like a wizard would. They're basically Wizards, but with slightly /fewer/ spells per day (because they have to do independent research to get spells to work with their unique bloodline), but they get a bunch of bizarre abilities that they can fuel with their spells.
