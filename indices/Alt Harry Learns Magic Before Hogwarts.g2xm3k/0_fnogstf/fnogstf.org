Okay... this sounds fun. I'll bite (and maybe work some of this into the fic I'm planning).

I know 5E came out in 2014, but it's the one I'm most familiar with, so let's go with that, shall we? I'll change things up a bit, to better work with 5E and my understanding of it, hope you don't mind.

Harry, as per your idea, decides on either Wizard or Sorcerer. I'm going to go with [[https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/sorcerer][Sorcerer]] because I think Harry deciding he's /not/ a wizard is funnier. And it makes sense. Wizards have to study magic, learn how it works. Harry didn't do that, so his magic must be innate. Hence: Sorcerer.

Next, Harry has to ask two questions: what race and what subclass is he? He'd probably settle on Human, as most of the others can be discarded just be a simple investigation. Now, subclass is where this gets fun. For me at least.

I choose [[https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/sorcerer#ShadowMagic][Shadow Magic]] for subclass, as this has some fun quirks, side effects, and features. (Although Divine Soul includes the option of your birth being part of a prophecy, and that's more on accurate to canon.)

I say Harry chooses this because of his dark cupboard. He must be in there because he needs to be encased in shadows!

A Shadow Sorcerer is encouraged to roll a d6, one that will define a Quirk for them, from the following.

#+begin_quote
  1 You are always icy cold to the touch.

  2 When you are asleep, you don't appear to breathe (though you must still breathe to survive).

  3 You barely bleed, even when badly injured.

  4 Your heart beats once per minute. This event sometimes surprises you.

  5 You have trouble remembering that living creatures and corpses should be treated differently.

  6 You blinked. Once. Last week.
#+end_quote

Any of these sounds like they'd cause some fun reactions to people. Except 5, that's just weird.

By 20th Level Shadow mages have 120 feet of Darkvision, can cast the [[https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/darkness][Darkness]] spell (and have the option of using it differently because they're Shadow Sorcerers), can occasionally go to 1hp instead of 0hp, can summon a ghost dog, can teleport from shadow to shadow within 120 feet and line of sight, and can turn into a ghost.

All cool stuff, yeah? Well, it gets a better, because that's only class features. Let's talk [[https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/class/sorcerer?sort=level][/spells/]].

Cantrips: Control Flames lets him control non-magic fire. Dancing Flames gives him four magic lights. Light lets him turn any item he wants into a lamp. Mending lets him fix up small damages. And Prestidigitation is just a whole lot of stuff.

First Level: Comprehend Languages does what it says on the tin, useful if you're talking to Goblins who don't want you to know what they're saying. Detect Magic also does the same, but might just point out that his scar is a bit funny. Feather Fall stops him from breaking his body when he jumps/falls off things. Sleep knocks things out.

Second Level: The Darkvision spell lets you give Darkvision to /other/ people, so now all your friends can see in the dark. [[https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-thoughts][Detect Thoughts]] is an interesting spell that is a bit too involved to explain in a list like this.

Third Level: Tongues lets you /speak/ other languages, sort of. Water Breathing does what it says. Water Walk lets you pretend to be Jesus.

Fourth Level: [[https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/polymorph][Polymorph]] is a fun spell that lets you turn people into animals for an hour.

Fifth Level: [[https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/animate-objects][Animate Objects]] is not unlike the one you said in the OP, I guess they reworked it. Hold Monster stops monsters from moving. [[https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/class/sorcerer?sort=level][Teleport Circle]] could work as an alternative to the Floo if Harry has a few years to set it all up (if we're sticking to the rules).

Sixth Level: True Seeing allows you to, quote, "see things as they actually are", unquote.

Seventh Level: [[https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/teleport][Teleport]] is a bit like Apparation, but with some interesting things that could happen.

Ninth Level: [[https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gate][Gate]] is yet /more/ teleportation stuff, now with portals. Mass Polymorph lets you turn up to ten people into animals for an hour. Time Stop /stops time/. And [[https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wish][Wish]] is... Wish.

I'll stop here, as this is getting a bit long, but let me know if you want me to cover backstories, feats, and the like. They'd all add more to the "Character" of Harry Potter.

I may return anyway, and talk about how a Harry that works like this goes at Hogwarts.
