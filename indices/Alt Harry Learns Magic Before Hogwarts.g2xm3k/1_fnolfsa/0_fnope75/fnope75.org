That's the annoying part of that fic, even when he teaches Hermione it basically amounts to "it just works".

I have half a mind to do a similar fic based on DnD 5E (ignore that it came out in 2014, it's the one I know best) and actually try and reconcile the two conflicting magics.

More realistically though: DnD elements will slip into the crossover I'm writing.
