Charlie Weasley went to Hogwarts between 1983 and 1991, graduating the year before Harry entered. Therefore, everyone above Harry (Cedric, Cho etc.) would have been in the at Hogwarts at the right time. For the purposes of this, I am only including people within three years of Charlie, as those are the only people he could have reasonably interacted with.

- Most of the members of the Weird Sisters (Myron Wagtail, Kirley Durke, Heathcote Barbary, Herman Wintringham and Gideon Crumb)
- Bill Weasley
- Nymphadora Tonks
- Stan Shunpike
- Percy Weasley
- Gwenog Jones (?)

Charlie was also on the Quidditch Team with Oliver Wood, Angelina Johnson, Alicia Spinnet, and Fred and George Weasley.
