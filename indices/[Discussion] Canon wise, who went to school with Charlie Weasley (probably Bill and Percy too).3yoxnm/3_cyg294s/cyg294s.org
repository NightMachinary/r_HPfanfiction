Quirrell would have been teaching muggle studies during Charlie and Bill's time at Hogwarts. But there's also a possibility he may have been a student before that, but also during their years there.

Edward Worple was class of 88 Gwenog Jones was class of 86

There are tons of Weird Sisters members, seriously it's a big group, and most of them went to school with Charlie and Bill. I've always though Bill must've been friends with them and gotten his fashion sense hanging around the future band members.
