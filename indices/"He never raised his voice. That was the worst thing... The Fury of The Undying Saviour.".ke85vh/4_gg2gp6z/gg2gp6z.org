‘We followed him, hoping to find his Hallows. And he ran away from us, as he always did, hiding with muggles and their ilk. Even Obliviated himself. So we threatened his little girlfriend, hoping it would break the memory block. And it did. She screamed so loud, /begging/ him to remember. Finally he stopped playing dumb. We agreed to meet to exchange his girlfriend for his hallows.'

The pale young man opposite me stopped here, seemed unable to continue. His face was difficult to describe: his skin seemed to have great difficulty hanging onto his bones, his eyes seemed hidden in his skull, and his shoulders were hunched over so much it reminded me of the foetal position. His hair - once, he assured me, very beautiful - was gray and tangled now, and several pieces of comb stuck out here and there. He took a deep breath and continued: ‘he came to Bella first, in the night before we would meet. We- we found her later. She was -‘ He hesitated, trying - I thought - to make himself say it. ‘- tortured into insanity. By... herself, apparently.' I didn't say anything. ‘My father was next. He always wanted to be our Lord's right hand. So he is, now...forever.'

‘How come?' I asked, curious despite my mounting horror.

‘He is his House Elf,' the man opposite me explained. ‘Bound to our Lord, forever. Even with our Lord's death, he's bound to his grave, tending it as best as he can. Punishing himself when he can't, no matter the reason. ‘

There was a pause, in which he finished his drink. I gave him another.

‘He never once raised his voice,' he told me. ‘That was the worst of it. At the meeting, he was almost calm. He told us all, quietly, our fates... that's when we realized the fury of the Savior of the -‘ he stopped himself. ‘World.'

‘Peter, who avoids danger at all cost and wants to, like, never be hurt, know what I mean?'

He looked up at me, and I didn't know what to make of this look. It seemed to me he was pleading for... help? Understanding?

I nodded, although I had no idea what he meant. You'd have done the same if you were there.

‘So he got trapped. If you ever see a rat with a missing paw, it's him. Always.'

‘Surely it can't be /every/ rat?'

He looked almost offended. ‘Of course not! Just the ones missing a paw.'

I decided he was loony and ignored it.

‘He still visits him sometimes, you know,' he continued. ‘Just sits down and tells him about his friends. He can never die. His soul is split and bound to all those...' he came to a shuddering stop.

‘My mom... well, she got a long sentence in a really bad prison, in the last cell that used the most terrifying guards - they're not used anymore - because she was complicit, but he went easy on her. The others... well, Crabbe and Goyle...,' he stopped. ‘Ever read /Feeders and Eaters/?'

‘Yes, of course,' I said.

He grimaced. ‘When I found Goyle he was a lot like the cat. Y'know, alive from the upper half, all bones and sinews from the lower half. S-said Crabbe had nee-needed him. Begged me for death. I was his friend... you'd have done the same.'

I couldn't bear the look in his eyes. ‘So what happened to you?'

It was the wrong thing to say.

‘As for me...,' he said slowly. ‘I lost the things most dear to me. I got banned from the only home I had ever known, the only home I had thought /worth/ knowing.'
