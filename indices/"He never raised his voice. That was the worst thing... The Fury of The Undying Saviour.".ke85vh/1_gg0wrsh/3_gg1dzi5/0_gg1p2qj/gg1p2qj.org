It's a quote from a Doctor Who two-parter, called “Human Nature”/“Family of Blood” IIRC. It's an alright pair of episodes IMO, I personally never quite got into it but there are loads of people who will practically swear by them. The ending though... the quote is originally from the ending (it's been modified here, obviously) and is my favourite thing about the episodes.
