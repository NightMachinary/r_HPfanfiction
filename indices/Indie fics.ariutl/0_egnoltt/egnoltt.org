As I understand it, it means independent Harry - a Harry who decides Dumbledore doesn't know best, makes the most of his wealth in Gringotts and his random nobility titles that he discovers he has, and lives as an adult despite being a teenager. It usually comes with great magical talents or powers, plenty of character bashing, and a darker/edgier Harry.

I can't recommend any because I don't like that kind of story.
