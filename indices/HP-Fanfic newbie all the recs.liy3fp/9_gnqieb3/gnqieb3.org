If you're as +infatuated with+ interested in Regulus as I am, consider this [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13582160/1/Severed][self-promo fic]] that follows Regulus from his sixth year through the end of 1979, mixing in some Marauders and a Regulus/OC/Remus love triangle in the beginning. It is a work in progress, not abandoned.
