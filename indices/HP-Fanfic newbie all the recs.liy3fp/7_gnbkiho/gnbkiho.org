Check out the Rights and Wrong's series by Lovesbitca8 on Ao3! Like you, I am a recent newbie of fanfic and these stories got me BEYOND HOOKED!! Seriously. I cannot recommend enough. First is “The Right Thing To Do,” then “All The Wrong Things,” and finally, my favorite “The Auction” which is an AU if Voldemort won.

I will warn you- these are Dramione fics which I never imagined I could enjoy...but now I do. So much. Give it a try :)
