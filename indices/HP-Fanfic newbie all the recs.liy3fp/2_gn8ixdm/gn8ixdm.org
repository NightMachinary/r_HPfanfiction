Linkao3(Grey Space)

In order:

A massive AU which, for many years, ended on a cliffhanger, and which the author just recently announced they'd be going back to. Basically, Voldemort won the war, and at first glance, things look more or less how you'd expect, and they look less how you'd expect as time wears on. Personally, I stopped reading at chapter 100, due to . . . personal reasons, but it's a great fic, and I've been meaning to go back and reread it, start to finish, for a few years, now.

Pretty much /the/ romance fic in the fandom, it's post-war, pre-epilogue single dad Harry/muggle OC who could teach classes on ignoring "don't talk to me" vibes. In progress, and updates are slow going, but they're quite lengthy when they happen, we got the last few in relatively quick succession (three in the span of a year, if memory serves), and it seems to be wrapping up.

An AU and OoC oneshot exploring the long term consequences of emotional neglect during childhood and through adolescence. Fun! And when I say OoC, I mean /very/ OoC. It's got two sequels, but they're honestly nowhere near as good as the original, in my opinion.

AU wherein the horcrux in Harry's scar wakes up and decides to raise Harry as an apprentice/heir/general henchman. It's complete, with an abandoned sequel. I think it sticks too closely to the station of canon f for its own good, but it's a fantastic story, all the same.

Again an AU, this one being the result of the war with Grindelwald having a /much/ bigger impact on Wizarding Britain than in canon, and Voldemort subsequently never rising to power. Its political structure is extremely Not Good, and Harry, who was adopted by the Blacks after his parents were murdered, is on the wrong side of it. Incomplete with very infrequent updates.

The dementor attack at the beginning of OotP goes differently, so the rest of OotP and HBP goes differently. One of very few stories I've read wherein Harry gets more powerful, and it's not really a good thing. Recently completed after a more than 18 month hiatus.

Harry's twin brother is the boy who lived, and while it doesn't make a difference to the Potter family, they all love the twins equally, the rest of the world really doesn't give a shit about Harry, and he really doesn't appreciate that. It's honestly less a story than it is a chronicle of him learning stuff, but it's interesting stuff, and it carries the fic. It's sadly been abandoned, but at least it doesn't end on a cliffhanger. Most of it is only available on DLP, and you need an account to read it, too, so it's definitely the least readily available fic on this list, but still very worth checking out.

Harry asks a different pair of twins to go to the Yule Ball with him and Ron, and things go very differently. Maybe the only decent poly ship I've ever read in the fandom; most are just "bland male protagonist has a harem of 10+ interchangeable girls." Oneshot.

Daphne Greengrass doesn't want friends, Harry annoys her into rethinking her stance on the matter. It's a short and sweet oneshot; not much to say about it, honestly.

Probably my most hesitant recommendation, it's an AU where Harry finds out he was adopted and his biological parents are actually Snape and Bellatrix. Yeah. That said, it leads into a philosophical journey of self discovery, and that's my jam, son. Seemingly abandoned.

The only Harry/fem!Riddle I will ever rec. It's three chapters and has been on hiatus for /many/ years, but the author is still active on the site, and has said that they might go back to it, so here's hoping.

A quick oneshot in which Sirius contemplates the role he'll have in his godson's life.

Ginny dies in the Chamber, Harry, Ron, and Hermione dedicate themselves to making sure that nothing similar will ever happen again, if they have anything to say about it. Abandoned, and doesn't really end on a natural stopping point, but still very worth your time.

Harry/Luna shenanigans in the wake of the former's occlumency lessons. Abandoned, but it's more or less a series of vignettes, so it's not that big a deal that it's unfinished.

Dudley learns some stuff about himself and his family and becomes a better person because of it. Oneshot.

Harry is sorted into Slytherin, which makes everything a whole lot more complicated. There are other good stories where Harry is in Slytherin, but this is the only fic I've ever read and enjoyed where that was the entire premise. Abandoned, sadly.

Harry is raised by Ollivander and has, wonder of wonders, a functional childhood. Also abandoned, because we as a society can't have nice things.

An AU in which students start Hogwarts when they're 14 instead of 11, so Harry spends three extra years with the Dursleys. The very rare fic in which the Dursleys' abuse and neglect are kept to canon levels, but also taken seriously and explored in depth. It's even complete!

*Bonus anti recommendation:* Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin. It has some good ideas and interesting concepts, but it's also close to 1.2 /million/ words, and a good editor would've cut it down to 300,000 without losing anything of importance. More than just plain wasting the readers' time, though, it commits the, to my mind, far greater sins of terrible characterisation with /massive/ redundancies in the cast, and an unnecessary fixation on the minutiae of canon (for instance, in canon, we only ever hear about 2 musical groups, so PoS assumes that there are only two musical groups in Wizarding Britain; that its author has this attitude, and seems to assume that their readers will, as well, goes a long way to explaining that bloated word count: I'd be genuinely surprised to learn that less than half of it was straight exposition).
