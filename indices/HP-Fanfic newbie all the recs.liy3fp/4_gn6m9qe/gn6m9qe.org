- The first stop should be [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] stories (start with linkao3(1615616) and then go on).

- My first long fanfiction story was “Inner Demons by serendipity_50” linkao3(601124), and it persuaded me, that the amateur writing can be worth reading.

- From the I-have-no-clue-why-it-is-not-more-popular-than-it-is category I have series “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]]” starting with linkao3(1048010).

- For adults (no, it is not a lemon, but it is morally ambivalent story) linkao3(11676102) and its sequels.

I have more recommendations on [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/tag/harrypotter.html][my website]].
