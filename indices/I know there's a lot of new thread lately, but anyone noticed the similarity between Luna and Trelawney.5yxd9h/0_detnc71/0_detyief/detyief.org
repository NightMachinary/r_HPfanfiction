Yeah, there's a lot of fanon going on here. There's very little in-universe explanation for Luna's eccentricity. The standard explanations of her father's break with reality after her mother's death or her being a seer are not exactly canon.

Trelawney? Yeah, we know even less. If OP want to write or read a story that draws parallels, or just wants to point out similarities in portrayal in fanfiction, that's fair enough, but it's ill-supported from the text alone.
