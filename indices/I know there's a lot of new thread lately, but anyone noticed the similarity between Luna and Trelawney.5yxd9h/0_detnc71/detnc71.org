Eh, I don't really see any similarities between the two - there's so little known about Trelawney's time at Hogwarts that I couldn't say for sure they both had similar experiences. What I do know is that Minerva's dislike for Sybill isn't that much to do with personal differences, as it is a lack of respect for Trelawney as a person and a professional - she drinks all the time, worries students by predicting their deaths (the scene in PoA in Transfiguration after Harry's first Divination lesson illustrates a certain resigned irritation on McGonagall's part), and in general McGonagall just doesn't appear to think that Divination is any good (she's a lot like Hermione in that respect).

Also, I prefer not to draw parallels between Luna and Trelawney, because people use that for the irritating seer!Luna trope, whereas I prefer to think that she's just weird for the sake of being weird, rather than any clear reason.

But, you do you, and feel free to read as much as you want into it.
