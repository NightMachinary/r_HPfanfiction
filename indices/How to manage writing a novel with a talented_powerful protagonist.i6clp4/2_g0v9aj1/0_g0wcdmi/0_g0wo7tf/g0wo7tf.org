I did my best to think of drawbacks, but it can be hard when insight into peoples minds is undeniably advantageous in so many situations. I've been reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10413771][Turning of the Times]] by noaacat and it has one of my favorite takes on legilimancy. It delves into the canon quotes from Snape about how the mind is not a book to be "read" or whatever and describes the magic as "occluding someone elses mind." Basically a foreign mind is going to be confusing and impossible to navigate so you have to focus and orginise their thoughts into something traversible for you.

edit: found a quote from the story

/Severus's blank look was answer enough, and Harry smiled. “Like I said, occlumency in someone else's mind. Yours didn't make any sense to me, because there was too much to process, so I slowed it down and organized it.”/

/“You... organized my mind.”/

/“I enforced an visualization, where it was a hallway and all your memories were paintings.”/

there are time travel shenanigans, and also a character with a special ability that could be very powerful, but is debilitating instead.
