Yeah it is very hard. Right now I think there are a couple of things I can use to limit it. The first thing I can do is simply not have it constantly being used. It's confusing exactly how it works in canon because of Queenie, but it seems clear that besides with her, legilimency is generally similar to most other forms of magic (and even if it isn't, I'm writing a fanfic). This means it's a conscious act unless it occurs via accidental magic. Following this train of thought, my character won't always be reading minds, or if he is, it will be extremely surface level. He won't be constantly delving deep into other people's minds because he shouldn't have any reason to. I can also create more justifications for why he isn't going way in all the time. It's more risky, would take a long period of direct eye contact, and so on. This can allow me to keep the character from becoming all knowing, but it still isn't great.

Thanks I'll take a look at the novel, it seems interesting. I think the idea of magic protecting the mind is cool and I was thinking of doing something similar. The way I was thinking about it was that for wizards, the more they want to keep thoughts or memories hidden (even on a subconscious level), the harder their magic works to do so. This wouldn't be a trained skill, it would simply be a natural extension of how magic interacts with the wizard's will. Some would be naturally better while others might broadcast even their deepest secrets, just like people are good or bad liars. I'm thinking of if like the precursor to Occlumency.

I've also been trying to think about novels that utilize legilimency. I want to keep my novel unique, but that doesn't mean I'll throw away good inspiration. Sadly, it seems like most novels that delve into legilimency and Occlumency don't do it amazingly.

Thanks you for the help by the way. I think you've given me some good ideas.
