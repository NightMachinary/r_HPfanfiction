This is definitely true but I do think it is less simple if you can read minds. It still doesn't mean everyone will like you, some people will truly despise you enough that no matter what you say or do, they will never like you, but if you can sense how people react both intellectually (telepathy) and emotionally (empathy), and want to make them like you, it will usually be very easy. That's the thing that really hammers home legilimency as really wild. You get a person's thoughts as well as the emotions behind them.

  For legilimency, knowing what other characters think may not necessarily help understand why they think what they do or what to do with that knowledge. Your character could glean some information, act on it, and be surprised because the person acted differently to what they thought.

This is very true and also very important. Thanks for bringing it up. There is a lot of stuff you can do with this, but sadly it's still only a partial solution. The deeper and more complex the ideas my character is trying to read and comprehend, the more likely he'll make errors. That's only logical. This means also means that surface-level stuff should be comparatively simple and in many ways that stuff is the most powerful. There is no reason he shouldn't be able to feel the discomfort or annoyance of someone when he's talking which, when combined with their thoughts likely telling him the source of those feelings, should allow for incredibly easy social navigation. This confusion and complexity you bring up are very important and will make it much easier in many areas though.

  Imagine playing spectator to everyone's brain stuff. It sounds overwhelming. Just because someone can naturally can "read" a mind, does that mean they can really understand what is being thought?
#+end_quote

Very true and no, I don't think it means they can really understand what is being thought, but it will mean they have a lot of practice. He's eleven by the time he goes to Hogwarts, this means he should have a lot of practice reading and interpreting minds. Still, I don't think that will make it easy or possible to always understand what people say. As you brought up, people barely even understand their own minds. Though I do think being an outside spectator may actually help evaluate and interpret people's minds in some ways, it would also come with lots of drawbacks and challenges. Another thing I can work with is the general insanity of wizards and the wizarding world. That would obviously make it harder for anyone to truly understand what they are thinking. If I make him used to reading the minds of regular people, he could struggle with adapting his previous experiences to his new situation.

  you could have it be that, as your character never relied on facial expression to know what people are feeling that they don't know how to emote very well themselves

This is a good idea but I'm actually gonna go in the opposite direction.

  I hope any of this helps, I also hope it isn't detrimental in some way, somehow.
#+end_quote

Thanks for the tips. Your advice was very helpful and I'm confident it won't be detrimental.
