there is no one in the world who is so great or so likable that everyone they meet is going to like them and cater to them. If you're going to have a character that is hyper competent at what they do, make sure other characters react appropriately.

For legilimency, knowing what other characters think may not necessarily help understand why they think what they do or what to do with that knowledge. Your character could glean some information, act on it, and be surprised because the person acted differently to what they thought. Like maybe some random character had a crush on some other random character, and your character wanted to help that budding romance along only for the prospective coupls to be caustic to eachother because they don't know how to relate.

i don't know. minds are complicated. Mood swings and random thoughts bewilder me and it's my own head. Imagine playing spectator to everyone's brain stuff. It sounds overwhelming. Just because someone can naturally can "read" a mind, does that mean they can really understand what is being thought? Maybe your character has difficulty filtering what part of the mind he's reading. Like he wants to know what a person thinks about some important decision and instead all he gets is the unpleasant feeling of their currently damp socks.

you could have it be that, as your character never relied on facial expression to know what people are feeling that they don't know how to emote very well themselves. To other people he would seem emotionless and expressionless despite his unique ability for empathy.

imagine it like this. Most people emote quite a bit. Someone good at reading faces can probably get a good feel of what another person is feeling based on body language. it can come naturally to them, just a matter of noticing rather than a matter of intense scrutiny. They wouldn't be looking all the time, and certainly would still miss things, but when they do look, they see more.

it's late, I'm ranting because i like tangents and the feel of a keyboard. I hope any of this helps, I also hope it isn't detrimental in some way, somehow.
