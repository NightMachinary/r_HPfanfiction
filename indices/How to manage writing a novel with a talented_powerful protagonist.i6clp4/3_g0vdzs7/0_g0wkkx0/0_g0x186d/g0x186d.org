Sure, happy to help. If there's one thing I'm good for, it's random psychological trickery. :)

It's not an exact replica of what people will think - even if you're the greatest empath/roleplayer on the planet, there will still be a degree of bias as the character you're trying to view perspective from will be designed and filtered through your own perspectives, but it can be helpful.
