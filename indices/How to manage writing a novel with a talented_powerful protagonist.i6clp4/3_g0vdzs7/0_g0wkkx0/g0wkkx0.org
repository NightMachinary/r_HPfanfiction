  I'd also say to give your OC weaknesses (Kryptonite, Moral Rules, Things They Fail At, Habits they want to hide, etc.), affections (People or Things They Like - see Nicer!Riddle's obsession over Hogwarts or Nicer!Draco's protectiveness over Pansy/Astoria), and/or Fondnesses (Things that make them smile or that they otherwise enjoy indulging in - be it fine wines, gardening, or cocaine

Very true. I'm doing pretty thorough character planning so that I can ensure my character feels alive and real. I think I've got many of those already, but most of them are more significant. I'm also trying to find/develop a lot of tiny things to use. When I read novels, that's what gets me to see the characters as humans. I think of Ron's fear of spiders or Harry Potter loving treacle tarts. As you mentioned, fondnesses, but also all the other tiny things, good or bad, that make up real people, but don't usually get focused on because they aren't of much importance.

That's a handy trick. Character interactions make or break the story, so I knew it was crucial to try and see from the perspective of the characters, whether they are teachers, classmates, or anything else. Still, I've never thought about doing that so I can get an idea of what my reader might see when they look at my character.

Thanks for the insights. I think they will be very beneficial to me.
