OnAScaleOfDebauchery and Subspace Embassy gave really good advice - I totally second every word of both their posts. In addition, I'd also say to give your OC weaknesses (Kryptonite, Moral Rules, Things They Fail At, Habits they want to hide, etc.), affections (People or Things They Like - see Nicer!Riddle's obsession over Hogwarts or Nicer!Draco's protectiveness over Pansy/Astoria), and/or Fondnesses (Things that make them smile or that they otherwise enjoy indulging in - be it fine wines, gardening, or cocaine). Prodigies (Gary Stu or not), like villains, generally aren't very relatable, which is why the advice always reflects ways to humanise them.

So, think of him from his classmate's point of view - humanisation is always about an external observer looking onto a character. If he's just a genius who blazes through everything and makes them all look bad, there's going to be some tension over that. So, what might make them like him? What besides the smarts might make them dislike him? What might make him tolerable? What feature of his character will they notice first (personality or physical or backstory)? What feature will they notice last?

It's a neat bit of psychological trickery that might help you work out what your readers will likely think of your character and can help you identify what could go into your character to influence those viewpoints. :)

Just remember that character features generally interact - either in conflict or in synergy.
