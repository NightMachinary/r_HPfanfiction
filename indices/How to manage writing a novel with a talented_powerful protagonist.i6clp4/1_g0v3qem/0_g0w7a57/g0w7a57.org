  Imo, what separates a Gary/Mary Stu and a hypercompetent protagonist is how much they struggle.

This is a very good point. Part of the reason I'm excited about this novel idea is that I think I've found some really interesting struggles that I can explore with it which I haven't seen done before.

  If your protagonist easily defeats everyone they come across, gets the girl(s) and fuck you money while the world caters to their every whim they would be more of a Gary/Mary Sue.

Yeah, it's just a matter of balancing these things. Because my character is going to be quite similar to Voldemort on the surface, he's going to inherit some gary stu-like traits. While getting the girl and getting girls is obviously very different, Tom Riddle was extremely handsome and charming. Honestly, any character with legilimency who can use it subtly and is willing to use it should be startlingly charming. They understand exactly what people are thinking and feel after all. Now, romance isn't gonna be a focus and neither will him pulling girls, I'm just trying to make a point.

Yep, this is really important, and I plan to make sure he struggles and loses throughout, but I think it's harder in the earlier years (especially year 1). This may seem counterintuitive as he'll be stronger the older he gets, but it's because of the challenges within the early books. Book 4 onward all have incredibly competent villains so it's realistic for even the most powerful student to struggle. Even if he is as talented and hard-working as Voldemort, he's still not gonna be on Voldemort's level (or even close). The problem is that this is less true for the first 3 years. The main villains are all hidden from sight and really nothing occurs until the ends of the books which pose a real physical threat to an extremely talented kid. This leaves more time open for him to not struggle. I know I'm going to focus more on emotional/mental/interpersonal struggles than on physical ones, and I think I have some really great ideas for how to create those, but a lack of physical struggles can still make a character seem overly perfect.

I definitely think you are right on balancing between hypercompetent and gary stu. I'll be working hard to make sure he stays hypercompetent without becoming a gary stu.
