Imo, what separates a Gary/Mary Stu and a hypercompetent protagonist is how much they struggle. If your protagonist easily defeats everyone they come across, gets the girl(s) and fuck you money while the world caters to their every whim they would be more of a Gary/Mary Sue.

If your protagonist defeats every opponent they come across but gets fucked up along the way, escaping through the skin of their teeth on several occasions and even getting lucky that's more hypercompetent than Sue. Nothing wrong with a hypercompetent protagonist, people love James Bond after all.
