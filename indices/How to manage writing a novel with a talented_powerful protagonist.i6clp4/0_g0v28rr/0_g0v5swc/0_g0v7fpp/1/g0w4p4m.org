Everything you said is right, but I also do think that by giving him a range of talent in different areas, people may subconsciously compare them to each other. Not sure if that makes any sense, but if he blows Hermione out of the water in DADA, but is only at a little better at transfiguration, it might make him seem less unjustifiably talented. I can also really focus in on specific areas and maybe even have him neglect others. I think even the most gifted people would struggle to match Hermione if they put in no effort in a subject. My big issue will be figuring out reasonable justifications for why he might neglect branches of magic as basically all of the ones people care about are just so cool and broadly practical.
