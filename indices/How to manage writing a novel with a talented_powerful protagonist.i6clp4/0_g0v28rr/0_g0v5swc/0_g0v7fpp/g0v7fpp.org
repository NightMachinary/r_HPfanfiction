I'm not so sure. The best wizards are generalists. Look at Sirius and James and how they excelled at everything. Look at Snape, potions master but also competent duellist with charms and transfigurations. The best wizards might have /affinities/, like James with transfiguration, but they're not weak in the other fields.

Hermione, the lower end of the spectrum I suggested, is also essentially a generalist. Her only exceeds expectations is in defense, understandably given her nature to freeze up during stress.

From "talented and intelligent", I got an impression that he wanted a character at least at Hermione's level. I imagine such a character would not have weaknesses, though I agree they may have preferences for certain magic such as offensive curses.
