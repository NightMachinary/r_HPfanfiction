Yeah, I can look into doing something like this. It'll have to be balancing act as, much like Impossible-Poetry said, I am planning on having them above Hermione's level and characters like that, in general, don't have many weaknesses, but I can try and make pronounced differences in different areas of ability. Wind shear was a good example. I also think that by at least illustrating his different areas of expertise, I'll be able change the reader's perspective of his abilities. People love to compare things so by keeping certain skills above others I may be able to make him feel less perfect, even if he is very talented in most (not all) of his weaker areas.
