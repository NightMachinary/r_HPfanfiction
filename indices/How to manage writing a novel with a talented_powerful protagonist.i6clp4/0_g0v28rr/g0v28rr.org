Have his natural legilimency be a burden at first. Seeing into the minds of everyone around him, feeling their unfiltered emotions, hearing their thoughts, having those capable of occlumency think that's he's intentionally violating minds, and not knowing what's his and what's not? That wouldn't be easy at all. You can have him gradually learn to control his abilities over the course of your story.

As for the other areas of magic, simply place him on a scale between Hermione and Sirius. On the Hermione end, you have a somewhat intelligence woman who studies vigorously to achieve near-perfect grades. On the other end, you have a highly talented individual who barely needs to study to manage top grades but will not likely be duelling Dumbledore anytime soon. I'd suggest slightly closer to the Hermione end. An intelligent, somewhat talented man, that studies to achieve near-perfect grades, though he can still easily maintain a social life and have fun.
