  Have his natural legilimency be a burden at first. Seeing into the minds of everyone around him, feeling their unfiltered emotions
#+end_quote

I can try this, or at least something sort of like this. The problem is that because he's a natural legilimens, he's abilities would be developed before he comes to Hogwarts. Voldemort is the example I'm thinking of. He could actively possess people by the time he went to Hogwarts, and while I'm definitely not gonna let this character do that, it would still be very weird if someone who could read minds their whole life hadn't learned any control by 11.

  having those capable of occlumency think that's he's intentionally violating minds, and not knowing what's his and what's not? That wouldn't be easy at all.

This I am gonna do, though he will be intentionally violating minds (not maliciously) so I think there is plenty to go on here. Especially with how he might interact with Dumbledore. He definitely won't be happy with the son of voldie reading people's minds.

  As for the other areas of magic, simply place him on a scale between Hermione and Sirius
#+end_quote

I'm not sure if you are talking talent or skill here. He definitely won't be as powerful as Sirius at least during his earlier school years, but I think a part of what could make a son of Voldemort story is seeing how characters deal with someone who isn't just his son, but who is in many ways similar to him. How can they look past his father's deeds when they see so much of him in the character? Should they?

I do think there are ways to keep him within your scale so I'll definitely keep that in mind. I can focus him on areas where the long term benefits might be pronounced but the short term benefits are comparatively smaller so his powers seem justified. Focusing on using ancient runes or potions for example. Not necessarily those specifically, but stuff where I can justify a genius still going very slow.

Thanks for the reply. It gave me some ideas to think on.
