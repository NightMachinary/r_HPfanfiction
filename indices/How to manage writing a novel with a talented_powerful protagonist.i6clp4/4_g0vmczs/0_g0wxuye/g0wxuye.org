  A talented student is above of his peers, it doesn't mean he is above everyone. Even Voldemort was polite and respectfull (at least in appareance) with his teachers.

This is always important to remember. There are also other things besides talent that go into making some "above" another. Harry has boy-who-lived clout. Draco has rich parents. As well, I want my character to align with what has been shown power-wise. Dumbledore could do things that his test administration had never seen done before, but that was Dumbledore at the end of his schooling career. Voldemort created a horcrux while at school, but he was a sixth year. It seems pretty clear that the genuinely prodigious can push boundaries or at least demonstrate incredible feats of knowledge and skill by the end of their time in Hogwarts, but that doesn't mean they can do the same during their first couple years at Hogwarts. That level of power and skill came from six years of Hermione-levels of effort (possibly more so in some ways) on top of their natural talent. I think this is the root of how to keep characters from feeling overly powerful and perfect. Characters need to earn their power. Talented characters might earn it easier and quicker, but they still earn it. They don't simply know spells, they learn them like everyone else. This also goes with the fluidity of it. While characters might sometimes get significant boosts in power like when Neville gets a better wand, generally, they should get progressively better.

  A first year learning easily all the spell of his curriculum, and even some 2nd year spells in one thing, it doesn't mean he should start learning NEWT level stuffs.

So my current plan is for him to be about a year or two beyond the curriculum by the end of first, with a variance between classes, though I'm not sure which ones he'll be best or worst at. Assuming I get through a whole year and keep it going, the gap will probably grow larger each year as he gets more time to apply his superior talent and work ethic (at least in the areas he's dedicated to). As he gets older, he'll get more specialized as the topics begin requiring more and more time and effort. Think Voldemort and the dark arts or Dumbledore and transfiguration. I think something like that would be consistent with the progression of prodigies thus far. I don't see classroom abilities as what set those two mentioned above from people like Hermione, so at least on an academic level there is another character who can be somewhat comparable. This will be especially true if he is dedicating a significant amount of time and energy to things outside of the curriculum. Does that sound realistic and workable?

  For Legilimency, maybe your OC could just have some raw talent into this branch, without being able to use il (until he learns it)
#+end_quote

Sadly, his being a true legilimens is an integral part of the story. As well, most of the issues of legilimency even come with pretty basic skills. He won't be doing jack to anyone with occulmency, though, that's for sure.

Thanks for all the advice.
