A talented student is above of his peers, it doesn't mean he is above everyone. Even Voldemort was polite and respectfull (at least in appareance) with his teachers. A first year learning easily all the spell of his curriculum, and even some 2nd year spells in one thing, it doesn't mean he should start learning NEWT level stuffs. Also, I don't know if your OC is supposed to age the same age as Harry or not, but if it's the case, please do not make him use the Accio spell to find Trevor on the Hogwarts Express, this scene is overdone.

For Legilimency, maybe your OC could just have some raw talent into this branch, without being able to use il (until he learns it). As an example, he could always has been able to know when someone lied to him, and he could "read" a person to know his mood (angry, sad, guilty . . .), but he can't do "mind reading" before he learns about legilimency and practice it.
