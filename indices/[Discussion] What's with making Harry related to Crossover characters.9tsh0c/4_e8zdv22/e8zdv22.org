Totally agreed. I began to read a Marvel/HP crossover recently but I quit because everything was related to the magical world in the end. Like Coulson was a squib and I don't remember half of it but everything was linked and it seemed so artificial. Best crossover is when the link are few or even nonexistent (like with dimension travel). A bit of family of maybe one person who is a link between the two universe isn't too bad but when everyone is... well nope
