Are you sure it's this one? This one I read and I didn't have too many problems with it but the one I was talking about had Coulson as the new History of Magic Teacher for some reason (as he was a squib).

I may be mistaken but I don't think it's in this one.

[EDIT] indeed it wasn't the one I was talking about. Just found it back it's Loki's Family linkffn(12380647).

In this Darcy is Loki's daughter and Harry his grandson. It's not really bad but the "everyone is related to Marvel characters" or "every Marvel characters is linked with the magical world" annoyed me quite a bit.
