On one hand, I agree with your points. On the other, I quite like the idea of someone being "different" because (s)he have a different lineage, as long as it's not unreasonably OP and the characters are not tranquil and calm on the face of rape/adultery.

For example, in the HP x Naruto fusion crossover that I'm writing, Lily is the result of a one night stand between a Naruto character (that I kill, with most of his family) and Lily's mother (that I widowed because I don't want to deal with the "father"). In that way, I evacuate a lot of problems (IMHO).

.

Also, what you might not have considered is that it's a very easy way to make a character OP by handwaving all possible problems that stems from that situation. Or in other words: wish fulfillment.
