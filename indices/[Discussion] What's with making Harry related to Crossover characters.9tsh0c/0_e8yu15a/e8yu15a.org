Surprise blood relations is an easy way to make a crossover; it's an immediate excuse to make the two fandoms meet without having to come up with things like plot.

But I have done it for an unposted fic---Harry Potter/Criminal Minds where Spencer Reid's mother is older sister to Lily+Petunia, so Harry gets raised by her in America instead. No superpowers from that, of course, and no issues with adultery, so probably not one that qualifies for your little rant. :)
