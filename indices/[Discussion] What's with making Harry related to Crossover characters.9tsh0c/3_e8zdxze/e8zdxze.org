linkffn(Mutant Storm)

In this fic Jean Grey and Lily Potter are twin sisters. Both mutants & both magical. However Lily's magic is more dominant, as is the mutant side in Jean, so they get separated before Hogwarts.

Story begins after book 5, when Harry is grieving at the Dursley's who abuse him (which release his mutant powers). His anguish is felt by Jean and she comes to rescue him.

In conclusion: so, yes to conjuring up a surprise blood relation, no to James being at fault.
