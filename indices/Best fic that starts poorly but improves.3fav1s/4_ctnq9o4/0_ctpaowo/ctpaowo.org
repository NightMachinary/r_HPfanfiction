I like this fict but the ending is weak to me and frankly, after reading so much of her ficts, I just wind up going down the checklist. It's like that with most writers, actually. They use the same tropes over and over in their ficts until it's this horrifying groundhog day repeat.

All that said, I agree that this is a good 'starts bad and gets good fict'.
