haha, I love long stuff so to me that's a bonus. It starts to get really good around chapter 23, which according to my kindle is 15% of the way in. Just before that was when I almost gave up. As for why, I hate to give away plot points but before that it looked like it might just be random Snape and Harry start to get along, but suddenly there's some plot movement and reasons for everything.
