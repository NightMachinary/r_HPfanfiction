linkaO3(A Year Like None Other)

For the first bit it looks like a kind of uninspired "Snape meets the Dursleys". The writing is always just fine but the plot bored me a bit, however I knew it had been recc'ed to me as the best "Snape adopts Harry" out there so I kept going and it turns out awesome, if you like that sort of thing.
