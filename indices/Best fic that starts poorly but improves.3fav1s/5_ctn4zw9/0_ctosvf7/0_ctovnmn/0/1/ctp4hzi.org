I actually liked the series. The bizarre sexual deviancy of the Black family and the whole child brothel thing was grating, but it really is only talked about at the start. Once you get past that part, it turns into a good antihero and/or dark protagonist story.

It crops up once or twice later on, but never in any of the capacity it was mentioned during the meet the Blacks scenes.
