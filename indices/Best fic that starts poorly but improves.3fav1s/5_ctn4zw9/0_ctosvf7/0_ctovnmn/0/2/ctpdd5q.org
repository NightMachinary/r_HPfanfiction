DLP really need to get their heads out of their asses, they treat Fanfiction like they're reviewing classical poetry or literature, it's not.

They're the quintessential pretentious douchebags of Fanfiction.

Have they not heard of a strong will? If your will is strong enough you could endure anything, just look at the survivors of North Korean concentration camps, they're lives before they escaped were *hell*! And they still manage to live productive lives and even some of them have the courage to go on television and speak, do they have problems? Of course they do, but most of them aren't broken people, far from it.

It's incredibly condescending to assume that anyone a victim of a tragedy would always be a depressed and broken person.
