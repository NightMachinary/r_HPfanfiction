The irony is that the canon HP DLP worships is so full of incredibly unlikely, unrealistic or plain impossible coincidences, that complaining about a major character not conforming to their ideas of how a victim of abuse should act comes over as highly hypocritical.

Doubly so since in canon, Harry is a victim of child abuse as well, with no visible consequence on him.
