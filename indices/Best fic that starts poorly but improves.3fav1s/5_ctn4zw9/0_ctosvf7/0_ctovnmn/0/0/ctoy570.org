I see where you're coming from, and its probably the exact opposite direction from where I'm coming from. I never treat fanfiction as actual novels. That also means that "Stupid Shit" doesn't put me off, most of the time.

Yes, the thing with every Black being a different sort of pervert is pretty over-the-top-stupid. But it made me chuckle.

And the thing about Jen being a (anti-)heroine in this despite her past as a victim of pedophilia is, of course, unrealistic.

But this is fanfiction. This is the unfiltered bullshit people come up with when daydreaming about their favourite fandom. I'd be really upset if I would've paid money to read it. But as it is, I'm going to FFN and expect, to a certain extend, that I find the unfiltered fantasies of people on there. That mindset is also why I often take the opinions and criticism of DLP with a grain of salt.

In the end, its all about tastes, expectations and what mindset you're in when you read fanfiction.
