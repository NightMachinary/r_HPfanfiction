I'm thinking being creepy is kind of the point, innit? Cliched... yea, probably. But what fanfiction isn't, really? Some are less than most, but I have yet to find a fic with no cliche in it.

What exactly? Its AU, so I, personally, give a lot of leeway.

If you're talking about Voodoo, then I have to at least put a good word in for it. While is surely isn't accurate (I'd be really impressed by anyone who could accuratly describe Voodoo and not be from, for example, Haiti or Benin), it certainly interprets a lot of the available facts quite nicely.

I found it highly entertaining and am still following the sequel.
