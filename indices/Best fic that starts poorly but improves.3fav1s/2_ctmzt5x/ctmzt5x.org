[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3522823/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire][Ginny Weasley and the Goblet of Fire]] has a rather cliche start, but once Hogwarts students arrive at Beauxbatons and the actual plot starts, it becomes awesome. Sadly abandoned, but there is some good stuff before it, and the first task is awesome.
