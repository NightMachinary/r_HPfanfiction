A neat little story about freedom. I've always had a weakness for globetrotter and adventurer fanfiction, not even contained to the Harry Potter fandom: it's fun to see other characters and protagonists just pack up and decide to see the world. So this is a great little oneshot. And while I'm also not a fan of evil Dumbledore, this is an extremely well done minimalist one. You can see a certain realistic escalation here, where Dumbledore starts doing somewhat reasonable things to try and contain Harry but eventually just goes "fuck it." His obsession was his ultimate undoing. Congratulations, this story gave control freak Dumbledore more characterization in 5,000 words than most 100,000 word fics can manage in fifty chapters.

And I like the implication that with all the Death Eaters arrested, the ministry un-corrupted, and Peter caught, that Voldemort literally does not matter anymore. He was never destroyed, but who cares? He's a delusional puddle of mist in Albania. Let him be king of the rats and spiders.

The little bit of romance and the happily ever after at the end with the Delacours was also excellent. Very well done.

The only thing that bothers me even a little bit about this is that the writer implies Sirius gets cleared, but there's no mention of him ever meeting up with Harry or trying to look for him. I know this happens literally in the last four sentences of the story, so it's not like there's really room for a scene or anything. I get why it's not there. But I can't shake the feeling that it should be. Maybe it deserves a sentence like "For reasons no one really understood, Lord Black never used an owl, but a bird delivered most of his important mail anyway just the same." Some sort of implication that they had contact.
