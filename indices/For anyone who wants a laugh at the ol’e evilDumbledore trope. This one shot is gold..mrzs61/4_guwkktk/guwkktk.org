LOL, I swear that Harry is related to my cat.... He literally ripped his way through the thing that attaches the air conditioner to the window because he wanted to go outside. Once he also jumped six feet straight up to get through the top gap in a wooden door. We learned it was hopeless to keep him inside.... Just like for Harry/Free. :D
