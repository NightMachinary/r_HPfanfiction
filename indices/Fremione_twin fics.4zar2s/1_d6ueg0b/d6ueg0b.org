I liked [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2155301/1/The-New-Mrs-Weasley][The New Mrs. Weasley]] pretty well. It's a Fred/Hermione where she marries him basically as a favor to get him out of a pureblood marriage contract. Then they both fall in love. It's pretty angsty and predictable but I liked it just because it's a rare pairing that's refreshing to read. Linkffn(2155301)
