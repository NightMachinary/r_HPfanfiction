I think it's also that people are WAY more likely to jump on female characters for being Mary Sues than they are to jump on male characters for being Gary Stus. Honestly even in OP!Harry fics, or harem fics, or whatever, the complaint is "Harry is too powerful" or whatever, and not "Harry is a Gary Stu/Mary Sue!". When it's a female character the first complaint always seems to be "Mary Sue!!!" which, is honestly just another insane standard women are held to even in fictional literature. If we're overpowered it's a huge terrible trope, not just one fixable issue which is often how it's presented if it's a male character. I'm talking strictly how people react here, not how the characters were written. If I went through a fic with a huge Mary Sue and changed her into a male character, I have a feeling that specific criticism would drop off substantially...
