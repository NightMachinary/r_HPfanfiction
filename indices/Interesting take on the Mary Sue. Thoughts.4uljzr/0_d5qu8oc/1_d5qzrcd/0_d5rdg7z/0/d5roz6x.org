That's a really interesting point about anime flowover that I hadn't considered but I think you've definitely got something there. I haven't watched a lot of anime or interacted much with the fandom but from what I have seen that would make a lot of sense to me.

I do though still think it's a pretty insane standard - and especially when you consider that most people writing Mary Sues are (from my experience, and I would wager in general) are young girls. This post notes why and I think it's spot on in saying that. But it doesn't cover the fallout of people jumping down author's throats or otherwise not reading what could be good works of fiction, and may lead to discouraging young women from fandom writing or writing in general, and I am just not about anything that discourages someone (especially girls) from trying out something they may be interested in.
