  But it doesn't cover the fallout of people jumping down author's throats or otherwise not reading what could be good works of fiction...

I know this is going to sound insensitive, and I don't want you to feel like I'm attacking your opinion. That being said, I feel like getting used to criticism is something you have to learn as an author, young or old, male or female. You could write War and Peace meets Ulysses, but there's going to be someone out there who thinks it's shit and is unafraid to tell you they think it's shit. This isn't something that's unique to adolescent girls who write Mary Sues, every writer has faced a cacophony of unfiltered, unconstructive criticism before. It's a pain that people jump down your throat, but if a couple of dicks shouting at you is enough to discourage you from writing, then you shouldn't be writing.

As for not reading what could be good works of fiction. Being ignored is one of the worst feelings a writer can have, perhaps even more so than being flamed, but you can't really blame the readers for their lack of interest, can you? Reader interest isn't something an author can demand; it's why we look so poorly on writers who demand a certain amount of reviews before they release their next chapter. The fact is that fanfiction, and the HP archive especially, has a huge fandom, and you only get a few chances to impress when there's another story just a few clicks away. If you're writing a Mary Sue, you're not going to be forgiven for being young, your fic will be ignored because it's not a good story.
