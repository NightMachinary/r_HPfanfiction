I don't think it's so much an insane standard women are held to, as it is people being too lax on overpowered male characters. Any overpowered Sue/Stu-like character (whether male or female) /is/ a huge, terrible trope that should be treated accordingly because it's awful writing that can ruin even the best plot. That male characters aren't treated that way is just bizarre to me.

Then again, I think a lot of the acceptance for OP-Harry and harem-fics is flow-over from the anime subculture that fanfiction is associated with, because animes with OP main characters and harem plots are fairly well-established in those circles.
