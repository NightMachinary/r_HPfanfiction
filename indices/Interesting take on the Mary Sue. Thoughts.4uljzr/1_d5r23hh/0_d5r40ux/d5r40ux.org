Squee! Another Animorphs fan.

Oh, and Marco put too little emphasis on emotions and doing the right thing, choosing instead to emphasize "the bright clear line," focusing on the ends. He thought he could be Machiavellian enough to push his mother off a cliff to off Vissers One and Three, only to be foiled at the last minute by his own incompetence.

Jake also had a thing about appearing stoic, and never letting the people you're leading see your self-doubt, which led to a lot of preventable deaths in the final arc, since he didn't bother to have his plan looked over by Marco and Ax. (He was also distressed at the time, thanks to his parents being taken.)

Anyway, Bella Swan was totally bland, so the reader could insert themselves into her shoes easier, yet every guy wanted her. I guess, if you're looking for unintended flaws, she was manipulative and didn't really care for the people around her. She's also supposed to be clumsy.

Tris, I'll admit isn't totally perfect, but was special because of what she was and not what she did, but I do remember her having a fear of intimacy and constantly worrying if she didn't fit her faction well enough.

Percy Jackson could be too loyal to a fault.

It was Tally's (from Uglies) fear of the pills that would undo the damage done to her that led to a possible boyfriend being put into grave danger, and she was a little too trusting of her society, never showing the skepticism her friend Shay did until really late.
