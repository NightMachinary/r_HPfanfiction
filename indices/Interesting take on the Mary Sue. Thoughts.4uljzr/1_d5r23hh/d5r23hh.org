I'm trying to think, but I believe every beloved childhood character of mine had faults.

Harry Potter was a bit too hotheaded and rushed off before thinking things through. Ron was too caught up in self-pity, and Hermione was too sure of herself and the belief that she was always right.

Hercules wanted to be a hero, but he didn't know the true meaning of the word until he was forced to make a life and death choice.

In Narnia, Edmund was a massive attention seeking brat before he grew into the valiant man that he was. In order to be so fair and just, he had to grow from the experience of betraying his loved ones. Susan was vain and bitter, and it cost her her place in heaven. Lucy grew too attached to family, sometimes to the detriment of others who needed her help more. Peter was a brave king, but even kings had lapses in judgement and could have trouble accepting help or letting others take charge.

Simba had to face his own guilt and inner hatred in order to become the one true king.

Tarzan had to learn about human cruelty in the worst possible way, because he was too trusting and naive, even when warned of his faults.

In Animorphs, each of the main characters was so caught up in their personal ideologies that it caused rifts. Jake was too self sacrificing, Cassie was too soft and lenient, Rachel was too hard and brash, Marco didn't take things with enough seriousness sometimes, Tobias was a broken child who locked himself into a bird form because he didn't belong anywhere, and Ax was constantly fighting between his duties on earth to his friends and his duties as an Andalite warrior to his superiors.

Even Ramona Quimby was an infuriating child who never stopped annoying those around her as she grew up learning about life.

Katniss Everdeen and Tris Prior were constantly fighting a battle within themselves as much as they are fighting a battle outside. Of course I've read these books as an adult, but their main demographic is young adult girls.

I read so many books as a child I'm only highlighting the big ones that I remember, but I can't recall a single Mary Sue in all my readings. Every character had their faults, and that was what made them relatable. It's what allowed me to get lost in these books because even if their worlds were fantastic and unrealistic, they weren't. If they were perfect, the stories would just be boring and flat. They had real issues within themselves that made their triumph even more resounding.
