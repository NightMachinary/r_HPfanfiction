Of course gender is relevant, that's what the post is about and what everyone in the thread (both men and women) are talking about. And I'm not disagreeing with you about the value of characters like Ramona and Lucy. I'm merely suggesting that there's far more bad reading material as well. No one's saying that your experience is invalid. But if you really thought gender didn't matter, you have mentioned it in your original comment instead of presenting your own experience as comparable to the original writers. Your experience is valid, but should be presented in comparison with the OP's (as that of a non-white male), not direct dissent to her equally valid perspective as a woman.

As a girl who has been a voracious reader since I was a child, I can tell you that for every Lucy and Ramona, there's 10 bland female children's book characters. And for every Hermione Granger and Katniss Everdeen, there's 10 pretty bland wish fulfillment teenage girl characters. And in any case, as a girl, you're exposed to a lot of literature where female characters are sidelined or non-existent. Boys tend to be a lot more nuanced.
