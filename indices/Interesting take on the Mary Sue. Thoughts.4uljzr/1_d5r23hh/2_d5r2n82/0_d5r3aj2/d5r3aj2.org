My gender really doesn't have anything to do with this. But if you want to make this into a tumblr battle on injustices, I'm a person of color, so hey, I'm covered because I'm not a white male. I'm told I'm worthless and less of a person every single day by the mass media, and there wasn't a single book that told me any different. Somehow I've managed not to adore and write about Mary-Sues, though.

And yes, I'm forgetting the bad books and remembering the good ones, because I don't tend to read bad books with bad characters. The entire point of the tumblr post was that she loved the books and characters as a child because the characters were perfect, and in her world of imperfection, that was something that spoke to her.

But I'm confused. In this post you've just implied that Mary-Sues make for bad books and bad characters. What about my post are you disagreeing with?
