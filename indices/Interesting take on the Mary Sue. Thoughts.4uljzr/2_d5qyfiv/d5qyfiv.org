Kids need/want heroes. People who can't fail, who always do the right thing, and everything turns out good.

As they grow up they move on to the characters that embody the struggles they themselves are dealing with, and when that character does/doesn't overcome those challenges, the reader can use that character as a way of looking at themselves.
