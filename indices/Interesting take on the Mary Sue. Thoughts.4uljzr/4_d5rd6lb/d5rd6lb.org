It's a cool post, but I don't think it's bringing new insight so much as it's an anecdote confirming what we already know about people who write Mary Sues. We already know that the Mary Sue/Gary Stu is terrible writing, and we know they're generally written by teens who haven't had enough life experience to write nuanced characters and understand why they're more compelling than flawless ones, or are using fanfiction as an escape from daily problems.

As for gender, I think it should be noted that girls aren't the only ones guilty of writing Mary Sues. Boys are taught to be manly, charismatic, and self-sufficient, and it's really hard to live up to that role when you're fifteen and asking your dad for lunch money. So a lot of teenage guys live out that power-fantasy of being the "ultimate man" out on paper, hence the super-OP Harry fics where he dominates over his friends, enemies, love interests, etc. Much like the Mary Sue is a cry from a female writer to be accepted, the Gary Stu is a cry from the male writer to be respected. It's sad, because they do this without realising that most of adult men are equally flawed as them; we're just old enough to be able to put up a good front.
