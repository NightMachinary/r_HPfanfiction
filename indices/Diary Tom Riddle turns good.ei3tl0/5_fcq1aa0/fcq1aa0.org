It is not the center of the story, but "A Black Comedy" by nonjon has this as a kind of twist later, and towards the end Harry interacts with diary Tom.

Usual nonjon disclaimer: nonjon writes great stories with nice characterization, plot and themes - but if you don't like his humor, you won't enjoy his stories. If you do enjoy it, you'll love them.
