Dumbledore was JKs device to spread the story out to seven books. Have everyone on the "good side" irrationally believe Dumbledore had all the answers and have Dumbledore consistently fail at planning and have things happen under his nose. He was wrong so many times. He was tricked so many times. He was reckless with children's lives so many times.

You wax philosophically about what a wise, ephemeral being he is...comfortable in his own skin. He should have been more worried...he should have been less comfortable...he should have had a sense of urgency and accountability to actually take part in executing some of his brilliant plans. He put himself in charge and should have done more.

He had the potential to be the great character you see him as but in the end he was just a plot device.
