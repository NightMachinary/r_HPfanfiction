I absolutely love what you've written up here ! He's my favourite character to write. A while back I wrote a fic about Dumbledore's punishment after his death was to be reborn as Harry and I kinda messed it up (I really want to go back to write it, but I've got an author's block on it) but up until now it is definitely the best fic I've ever written. In mbti I've actually tested as intj several times so really his character is the exact opposite to my personality. Perhaps that is why I love delving into his character to try to write him and his motivations ! Consider your post upvoted and saved.
