I honestly agree with the way you see him, but that is also the reason why I dislike him so much. It's all well and good being comfortable with the future, but what if the future isn't a desirable one? He's too comfortable with it in my opinion, and because of that he ends up assuming everyone else should be just as happy with where fate is taking them. This then leads to him making unilateral decisions about other people's lives without their input; such as forcing Harry to return to the Dursleys' each summer. He has his reasons, but doesn't care to listen to another opinion on it because he sees patterns, as you've said, and thinks the minutiae of another person's life is irrelevant to the larger pattern at play. There's nothing wrong with "rag[ing] against the dying of the light," but I think Dumbledore would disagree and tell you to accept the hand that fate has dealt you.
