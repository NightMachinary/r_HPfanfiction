I'm working with my bad memory and warped fanon but I don't care.

Part of the problem with Dumbledore is no one feels like they can tell him he's wrong. People just blindly follow him. This is not entirely on him. He's not a puppet master. He's a chess master and he is also a piece. He's not even the King.

He's in a role where he has to handle everything. He's just one dude and he's bad at it. His only reliable informant is Snape and that's just because Snape is a good spy. He puts him in charge of children. He's so bad at it. He put Arabella Figg in charge of Harry's wellbeing.

I think the last thing he actually planned was the stone debacle. Voldemort booked it into a castle, severely weakened, went through three dramatic puzzles and felt really good about himself until he comes across a mirror puzzle that couldn't have been more effective against him. He gets burned out, prophecy over. Then Tom Riddle, in all of his dramatic teenage diary glory, gets dumped on him and several horrible dots get connected very quickly.

Prophecy hurls child against fated enemy again and again. Fate works in strange, mysterious, and inconvenient ways.

It's just occurred to me that prophecies fatelock things into a narrow wobbly A to B line and I've lost my train of thought completely. It's the most messed up thing in the HP universe. That's going to bother me all day.

Anyway someone tell Dumbledore there is no I in team or to at least get friends.
