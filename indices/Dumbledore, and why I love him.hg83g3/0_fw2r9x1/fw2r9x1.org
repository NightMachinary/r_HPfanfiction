Yeah, I gotta say Dumbledore is ultimately a plot device. He has the potential to be as you described, and I agree that fan fiction should focus on bringing this out, instead of repeatedly bashing him. That still doesn't change that the books weren't very well planned out, the sudden genre shift from children's stories to YA in GoF mucking that up, and JK's over-reliance on troops leaving so many characters two dimensional and holding the idiot ball just to make the plot work.
