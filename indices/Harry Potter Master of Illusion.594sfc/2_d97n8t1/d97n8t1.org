I haven't gotten around to re-reading this one yet either, but as I recall it's a story where Tom Riddle is a completely fake person created by someone called William Cartwright.

It's more about trickery and misdirection rather than awesome holograms and phantasms and invisibility and whatnot, but it's fairly funny from what I recall, you might like it all the same.
