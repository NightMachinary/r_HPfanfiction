I don't think I've ever been completely satisfied by an ending of anything (even outside of fanfiction). I can't help it, I'm a nitpicker!

Then there's the fact that it's easier for us to remember bad endings than the good ones and that canon was so terrible in the end (epilogue + Harry probably should have died thematically), which means: Basically anything that's better than the canon train wreck is good in my book.

I'm just going to rec some fics where I didn't think the ending was bad, okay?

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12188150/1/Like-Grains-of-Sand-in-the-Hourglass]]) (just a nice happy ending without a catch-22 gotcha)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307886/1/Strange-Reflections]]) (didn't overstay its welcome, knowing when to end it is just as important as the how, also everyone gets their just deserts)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7200246/1/Impossible]]) (tonally appropriate, not everything is suddenly okay and perfect just because Voldemort is gone)

What's missing in this list is a fic that truly ends with a bang. [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/5185/1][Forever Knight]] almost qualifies, but it takes a bit too long to wrap things up in a neat tidy little bow, which is completely unnecessary.

I had a surprisingly hard time thinking about endings here. Just goes to show that as long as the ending isn't actively terrible I'll probably be fine with it.
