I'm writing two longer stories, one about Harry being adopted by the Tonks family after a slightly altered Pettigrew encounter, and one about Harry stumbling into a relationship with Tonks and an international murder-mystery (I'm rewriting the first chapter of that one since it is from a time where I was still new at writing).

I've completed two short stories, one about Hermione wingmanning for Harry and Fleur, and one about Hermione meeting Tonks and quickly developing a crush on her. Also, a response to a prompt about Sirius having a different Animagus form, but that is just something short and silly.

There are plenty of one-shots and short stories sitting on my GDrive at various stages of completion, I hope to get at least one of those done after the next weekend (Most likely the Harry/Pansy one, but it could be chapter one of a HufflepuffHarry piece as well).
