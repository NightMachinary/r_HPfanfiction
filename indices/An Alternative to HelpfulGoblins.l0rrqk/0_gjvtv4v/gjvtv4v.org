Can we have dragon monologuing about the "debased and inadequate snake language which is incapable of the subtlety and power required to communicate draconic thought, but I suppose I'll temporarily lower myself to your level because you are a moderately interesting pathetic little mammal despite the insignificant number of neurons in that tiny head of yours"?

And then Snape and the dragon live together sneerily ever after.
