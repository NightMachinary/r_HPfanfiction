The problem isn't with the house system, it's with the fact that the staff have allowed the rivalries to escalate from friendly competition into outright hate. There are no cross house activities or competitions, where the students need to work with the other house in order to succeed. This is in direct contrast to public schools in the UK that still use a house system, where you might have a house football team, but there'll also be a school team that plays other schools. Or they might have a debate team, or other school wide things where the best people from each house are picked. However in the books, the only sport seems to be quidditch, and the only time we see any interest in the other schools is the Triwizard.
