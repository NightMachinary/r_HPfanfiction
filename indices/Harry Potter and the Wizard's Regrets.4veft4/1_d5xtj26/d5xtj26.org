The dissolution of the canon marriages is a fairly common trope in H/Hr fanfic. I think lorien829's Senses is probably the most frequently recommended on this subreddit, but it has a happy ending. Don't think I've ever seen one where Harry and Hermione don't connect at the end of it, though. It sounds kinda like anti-romance.
