Again, definitely did not take enough time to develop the Harry/Ginny relationship. I should have thought about that more, but this was more stream of consciousness rather than a developed story. But in terms of what Harry and Hermione have in common, one could write a book stitching together all the tender moments they've had that can spark romance, not to mention the shared experiences. These create the strongest bond, and frankly they're why Hermione and Ron got together in the first place. So if they could do so, why not Harry and Hermione?
