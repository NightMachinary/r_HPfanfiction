All fanfics usually go overboard with the first one. Peter, while more of a follower, was still one of their best friends. Keep in mind that while he was viewed as the one who would seem insignificant to the death eaters, he was still trusted enough that they would put the Potters' lives in his hand. Most fanfics portray him as overly cowardly, clingy, and as a hanger-on, not as an actual friend. It's not like he was a slimy bastard who sought to plot against and use the others, nor did his friends view him as inferior to the rest of them. It's just that his fear won out against his loyalty to his friends. I think TheBlack'sResurgence's Stepping Back does a good job of portraying Peter, and lays out a realistic path in which Peter doesn't turn to the dark side.
