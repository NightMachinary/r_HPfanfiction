I like how [[https://shoebox.lomara.org/shoebox-pdf-chapters/][The Shoebox Project]] shows Peter feeling left out, and finding new friends who seem to really like him. That's not the main part of the fic. There's a lot of good stuff in it.

Has anyone mentioned All the Young Dudes yet? Remus has a different backstory than canon. Writers somehow can't resist making his life even worse.

And a self-recommendation showing how Remus lost the trust of the Order:
