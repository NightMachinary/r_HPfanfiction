You're probably better off looking for oneshots? Rather than whole stories?

Linkao3(Age of Lies by TheDivineComedian) is a good "Everyone is suspicious of Remus the Spy". In fact, everything by The Divine comedian is awesome, you should read it all. They're really good at those, balancing the lines between fear and trust.

Linkao3(Break by K1toftheworthies) has a lot of flashbacks to Marauder Era that explore things like Peter and the Prank and everything else which is very good. Though it's not the whole story.

Linkao3(The Art of Getting By by sarewolf) is an incredible Remus raising Harry story that is just brilliant. It looks at the emotional struggles a 24 year old Remus goes through trying to come to terms with everything that's happened, I highly reccomend it.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10283045]]) is a Peter Pettigrew story you might enjoy. It's written like an argument. While I don't agree with all their points, it was super interesting to have that debate on why he was secret keeper and all the rest. Very good.

Hopefully they help? I think you'll like TheDivineComedian's stories.
