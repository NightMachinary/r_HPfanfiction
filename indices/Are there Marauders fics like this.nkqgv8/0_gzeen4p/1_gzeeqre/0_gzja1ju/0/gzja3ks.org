  The trouble with falling in love, Remus reasons, is that you can never be sure who anyone is. Ed Sheeran using his second account, for instance. A flat earther with a pierced tongue. The guy you've just been set up on a fake date with. Wait, what?~(or: Sirius can't write; James can't get a date; Lily can't make a plan; and Remus just can't.)
