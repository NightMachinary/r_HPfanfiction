Lily and Snape talking about James saving Snape's life is definitely before SWM - both in the pensieve and as they happened. Snape threatens to sleep out in the corridor the night of the worst memory and that is when they part ways for good. The memories go in order: the sorting, the argument about Lupin and James (that's the big time jump, between the sorting and this part) and then the DADA exam and worst memory and then that night Severus outside the portrait and Lily telling him this is the end.

We never get told what year it happened in as many words but - along with the timing as shown in the pensieve - we're told Sirius was 16 when it happened. 16 is 5th year - Harry is unusually young in his year group, his birthday is not until the school year is over but most people (Sirius included) turn 16 in their 5th year of high school (or yr 11 as it's called in the muggle world)
