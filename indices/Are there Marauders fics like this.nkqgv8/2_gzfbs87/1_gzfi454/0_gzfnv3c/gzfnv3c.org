in book 7 when harry sees all of snapes memories, there's one where lily and snape are talking to eachother and she says "i heard james potter saved you from whatever is under the whomping willow"

that has to take place before snapes worst memory because that was a pretty clean break between the two and they wouldn't have been hanging out 1 on 1 after that

also sirius black's birthday is in november. he would have been 16 years old during his 5th year more than he was 16 during his 6th year.
