  - How Remus and Sirius' relationship would have played out after that werewolf prank gone wrong with Severus. While I've seen this explored in many fics, a lot of them are wolfstar. I haven't come across a well written one where it only explores their friendship and where they are not in a relationship or won't be in a relationship in the future.

I honestly realistically don't think there was a ton of blowback from this. It actually happens before Snape's worst memory and Remus was acting pretty normal with Sirius that day.
