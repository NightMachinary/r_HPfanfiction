Well, if it's a house... /Evanesco/ the mortar and foundations? A /sonorus/ variant that hits the structure's resonance pitch, causing the building to shake apart? A spell that delivers a massive punch of kinetic force that simply blows the structure away and turns anything organic it hits into a red puddle with the consistency of molten cheese? An /oppugno/ or /piertotum locomotor/ charm that targets the house's bricks? A /depulso/ and/or /accio/ aimed at the load-bearing wall(s) keeping the house up?

It's magic mate. Doesn't need to be just those three. A clever enough spell-chain incorporating one or all of the above would do the same with less noise. Hell, if the house has a warding system, blow /that/ up and let the backlash turn the house into a bomb for you.
