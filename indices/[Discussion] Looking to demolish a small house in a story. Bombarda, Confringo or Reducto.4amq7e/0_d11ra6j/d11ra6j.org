Out of the three options, bombarda, as it is shown in the third book and movie to be able to demolish a door/door frame, and it has the root word Bombard, which suggests siege level destruction. Personal opinion? Invent a stronger spell. I remember one fic there existed a spell that took ten seconds to cast but had enough force to send a car flying down the street.
