I've never been a fan of the "Maxima" addition. Just seems a bit lazy, not to mention we never get any idea how much more powerful it's supposed to make the spell. And assuming it does make it more powerful, at what cost does this happen? Apparently you don't get physically tired doing magic, but there's got to be a reason why people don't toss out more maxima variations of spells, the patronus for example. Can you imagine a Patronus Maxima? No one would use the regular version.
