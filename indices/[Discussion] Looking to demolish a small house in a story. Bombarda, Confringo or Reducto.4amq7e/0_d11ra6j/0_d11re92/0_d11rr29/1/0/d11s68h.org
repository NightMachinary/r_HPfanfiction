This is where HP's magic system starts to frustrate me. I agree they'd be harder to cast, but I don't know /how/ they'd be harder to cast. I'd call it a classic case of "add more dakka" but apparently HP magic doesn't rely on quantifiable power. I'd say you need more familiarity with the spell, but the books never go into what casting magic actually /feels/ like, if it feels like anything at all. There's just no information beyond plot related stuff.
