I supposed the stronger versions of the spells are harder to cast. If you're not comfortable with a Maxima version, in a time of emergency you might find yourself using a weaker spell.

But yeah, I expect stronger wizards won't bother much with the normal variations. Even so, there are so many spells stronger wizards don't bother with - Expelliarmus, for example.

And keep in mind - not every wizard is good at spells. Neville, for example, might have struggled with Maxima.

And of course not /every/ spell has a stronger variation.
