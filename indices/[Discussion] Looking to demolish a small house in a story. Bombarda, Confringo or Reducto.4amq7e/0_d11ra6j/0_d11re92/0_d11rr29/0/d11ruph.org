I agree.

Although I suppose with explosions there is time you want to blow up a bookshelf, there are other times you want to bring down a wall. Or as in my case, a whole house. In that case the levels of finesse make sense.

I didn't want to create a spell I would have to explain if there was already one which would do the job.
