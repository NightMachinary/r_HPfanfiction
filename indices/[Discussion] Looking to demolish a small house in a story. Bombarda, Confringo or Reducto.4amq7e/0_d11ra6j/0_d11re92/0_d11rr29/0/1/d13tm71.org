I don't like Bombarda Maxima BUT there is some support for it in general. ex. Protego and Protego /horribilis/. Or even Mobili and Mobili/arbus/ (arguably) but I think canon implies they aren't required. They are simply additions to the spell to specify/help with the casting. The addition does not inherently provide an effect. I think it's Tonks who does a Pack! spell, Tom Riddle does a Tell The Truth!, Snape does Reveal Your Secrets! These aren't real spells, they haven't been crafted and invented the way I like to think normal spells are, but they can function based on/if the person has understanding and a specific desire. Similarly I believe adding extra words might help hone a result, particularly if they have an extra half second to get it right. However the result is based solely on the casters already present understanding (knowledge, practice etc.). ex. If a forgotten silly charm was found and the incantation and nothing else given to Professor Flitwick and Augusta Longbottom there is a decent chance Flitwick could perform it (or at least in short order) Augusta wouldn't stand a chance. Back to Bombarda (or Protego) it doesn't matter if the person includes an addition as it won't do anything outside what they already could. So it is canon to have extras, but they should be used with caution as it has a high likely-hood of sounding silly.

To expand on the understanding a spell idea- Lets take Protego which simply protects. Provided the person understands the concept sufficiently, but there is a weight behind that concept. We know this can't be easy because there is a school, a whole class subject, sections of if not entire books on the spell and idea- and still many witches and wizards can't do it. So it might be as abstract and akin to knowing someone. Knowing the name Jane, knowing of a Jane, knowing Jane, knowing the real Jane, and being Jane and knowing things no one else does are large and often profound differences. I don't think it's easy. Again the point being /horribilis/ won't do anything save help the wielder focus on the understanding and concept of the spell/desired result.
