Mobilliarbus is not a strengthened version of mobillius, just a more specific one. Arbus, like arbor, means "tree", so mobilliarbus means "move tree". I have no idea why more specific wording would be helpful in these types of charms, maybe it gives better control over the motion (she's trying to be sneaky at the time).

I very much agree with your ideas on "maximus" etc. Magic is visualization, belief, and intent, with a hefty amount of ritual. Emotion helps. Beginners find shouting helps focus their intent, masters learn to focus without speaking at all. Someone who is really damn good at a reducto can scale their level of force with the same incantation, or no incantation at all, but other people find that adjectives like maximus or horribilis helps gear their mind into a proper "blow ALL of the stuff up" mode.
