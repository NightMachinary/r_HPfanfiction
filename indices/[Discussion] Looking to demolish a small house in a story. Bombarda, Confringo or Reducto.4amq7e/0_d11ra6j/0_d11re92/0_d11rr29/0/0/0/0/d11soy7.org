Okiedokie. Magically unstable (as opposed to mentally unstable) would give his victim an out (assuming you want the victim alive) by destroying certain parts of the house more than others and collapsing it a certain way. Since he is magically unstable, that takes the uber-badass route out of the equation, as you would need to be both stable and powerful for something like that to work. Which is good imo, uber-badass comes with a number of other problems (i.e. it sets standards for previous and future actions).

You could rupture a gas line, but unless they had the stove on (assuming this a muggle home) I don't think it would catch fire. In my opinion, HP spells don't really "spark" like explosives do, they just directly cause the effects. A bombarda hits the wall and the wall splinters forcefully. A cutting spell hits the couch and the couch splits. There's no... friction, I guess you could say. And I doubt the killer would know that a gas line was ruptured, so he wouldn't think to use a fire spell to set it alight.
