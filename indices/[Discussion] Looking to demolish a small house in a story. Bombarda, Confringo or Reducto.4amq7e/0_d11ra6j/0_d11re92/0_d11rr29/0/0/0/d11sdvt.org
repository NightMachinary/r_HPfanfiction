I'm writing a Post Hallows murder mystery and my killer (who is magically unstable) is trying to kill the one person he thinks might be on to him. (There is a reason he decides to use these means as opposed to something more direct but that would involve me telling you a huge slab of the story which would probably bore the teats off of you.) I suppose the whole whose doesn't need to be vaporised but damaged enough to be structurally unsound. I suppose a rupturing gas line could burn down the rest?
