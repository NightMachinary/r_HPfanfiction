Honestly, I doubt there's any one spell you can use to take down an entire house in one go. Houses are actually pretty sturdy, for obvious reasons. They have multiple load bearing walls, they'll have supports, they'll have concrete foundations. If a tank can drive straight through one and not have it collapse, one spell isn't likely to do the trick. So either you're just having him cast Bombarda Maxima (if you must) at the house repeatedly until it gives, which would probably take anywhere from 5-10 tries, or you go the uber-badass route and use one spell, just once. There are problems with the second route, depending on which character is destroying the house and when in the story they're doing it, but without knowing who I can't say what exactly. Would you be alright with elaborating?
