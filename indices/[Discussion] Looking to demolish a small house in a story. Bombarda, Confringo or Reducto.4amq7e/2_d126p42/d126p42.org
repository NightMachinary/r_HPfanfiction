A note on canonicity- ignore this if it doesn't matter to you.

Bombarda is a movie spell- it never appears in the books. Similarly, the '-maxima' modification was a movie-based expansion, as are the variants of Lumos often found in fanfiction (-Solem, -Solaris, -Maxima). There were variants of the Shield spell which modified the effect and scope [-Horribilis and -Totalum] but that's it.
