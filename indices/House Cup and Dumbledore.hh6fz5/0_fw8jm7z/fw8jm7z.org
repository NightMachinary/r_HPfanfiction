It's not that he awarded the points, it's the WAY he awarded them. The other students have an incredibly warped version of the tale. (They did know about it, but not the extent of it as shown by Ron and Hermione's reactions to Harry's retelling. And remember, they were THERE for most of it.) To an outsider, Dumbledore's reasoning is shaky at best. I mean, 50 points for a game of chess? (I'm not discounting Ron's sacrifice, but Dumbledore awarding him all those points for being good at chess and not, say, being extremely brave and selfless in the face of danger both takes away from his accomplishments and alienates the people in other houses because it just looks like Dumbledore is making up reasons for Gryffindor to win.) Then there's the fact that Dumbledore awarded these points at the end of year feast, which seems to me extremely petty. Remember, some of these kids are ELEVEN. I would have been pretty upset if I thought I had won a big competition only for the win to be snatched from me at the last minute, after I was super happy that my team had won. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville definitely deserved those points. I'm not saying you're wrong about that. But Dumbledore could have handled it better and given them the points BEFORE the end of year feast, like he did in Chamber of Secrets.

TL;DR: The points were deserved, but Dumbledore should have awarded them before the feast.
