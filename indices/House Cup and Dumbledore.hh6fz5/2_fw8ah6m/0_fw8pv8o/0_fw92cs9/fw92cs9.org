Terribly sorry, don't know what happened. I'll put this here for anyone interested.

  Thing is, that wasn't Gryffindor house as a whole, that was just Harry. In those circumstances he should have been awarded the trophy for special services to the school. And on top of that, Dumbledore should have given the points once he found out what happened, so the other houses had a chance of catching up. To be given points after the cup has been awarded is just cruel to the house that had won.
