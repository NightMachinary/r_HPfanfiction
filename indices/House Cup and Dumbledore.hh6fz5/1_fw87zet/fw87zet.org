Awarding Harry is good but dumbledore did it in a way that made it seem like blatant favouritism at the same tome he encouraged reckless behaviour

It all works out in the end but if I was in one of the other houses and put in an effort in throughout the year to earn points and then at the end of the year someone is just handed the cup for nonsensical reasons like dumbledore came up with I would be pissed.
