They still got points shoved up their ass by Snape for doing nothing at all.

The way Dumbledore does things isn't good, but if he did thing properly, Slytherin would be dead last all the time. The "you're next, mudbloods" alone would be enough to reset their points to 0 in year 2, especially since no one called him out on it. Or their cooperation with Umbridge (almost all named Slytherins were in the Inquisition Squad), or Malfoy committing war crimes in HBP (perfidy was enough to warrant execution by the allies, so - how many points does that amount to?).
