  "you're next, mudbloods" alone would be enough to reset their points to 0, especially since no one called him out on it.

I agree with that, I would have certainly punished them and specially Draco, severely.

But we don't know if Snape does the point thing ALL the time or just when Harry and Co. are around because he sees then as the New Marauders, the way Dumbledore did it, he looked just as bad as Snape, but in the front of whole school, and the part where the Banners change is the worst.

It does give some validation to the fics where Slytherins see themselves as unfavored by Dumbledore.
