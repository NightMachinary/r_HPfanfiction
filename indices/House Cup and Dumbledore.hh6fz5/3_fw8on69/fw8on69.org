Half of the problem was the presentation, it was incredibly hurtful to all the Slytherins(most of which were innocent) and some could even say, ALL the other Houses, the damn Hall was already decorated, he could've just awarded the victory points to the Trio and Neville and then given a special services award to Harry, all this with blank flags so the Slytherins don't feel cheated because the Headmaster favors the local celebrity.

For those not in the know, it just seemed like the Headmaster was strongarming the Cup to Gryffindor.
