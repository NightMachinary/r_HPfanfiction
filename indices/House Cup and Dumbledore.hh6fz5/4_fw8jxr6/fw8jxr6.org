The main problem I have with that scene is not that Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville get enough points to beat Slytherin, it's more the way it's presented. They get the points awarded after Dumbledore has already announced that Slytherin won. The way it's presented the message Dumbledore is "Yes, well done Slytherin...SIKE, Gryffindor wins, get fucked, idiots!"
