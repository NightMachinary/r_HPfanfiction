Anything by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/][Starfox5]], probably.

[[/u/deepjeep123][u/deepjeep123]] I recommend starting with /Hermione Granger and The Marriage Law Revolution/ first. It's the earliest of Starfox5's fics. It's about Hermione taking a stand against legalized rape, which is essentially what the Marriage Law boils down to. It occurs a year or two after the Deathly Hallows.
