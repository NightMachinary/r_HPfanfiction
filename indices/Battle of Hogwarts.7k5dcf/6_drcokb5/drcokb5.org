My thoughts are that since house elves serve wizards/witches it might be hard for them to defend with real elf magic because it may cause serious harm to a wizard/witch . I'd like to think that it took time for Kreacher to rally the the elves together. They also only used knives to attack ankles and shins of Death Eaters (I am assuming non lethal areas). Even though Dobby was extremely loyal to Harry he only meant to stop Lucius, and Bellatrix as well later on, and not cause serious harm to them (Even though I think most of us would have loved to see the little guy getting rid of her permanently). Just a thought.
