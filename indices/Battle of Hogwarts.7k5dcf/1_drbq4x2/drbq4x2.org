Hmm...well, I wouldn't say they're exceptionally powerful; not necessarily more powerful than a regular wizard, and I think a combat-trained wizard could stand against them pretty well.

But house-elves have the advantage of being able to Apparate around Hogwarts where nobody else can, and they can bring others with them; they could help a lot in moving innocents and injured people out of danger, defenders to more advantageous positions, and team up to pick off any attackers who end up on their own.

Of course, it wouldn't necessarily be ethical to order them to defend the castle; in Deathly Hallows when the battle takes place, Ron actually remembers about the house-elves and considers that they should be ordered to evacuate, not fight. That said, the elves do burst in in the second part of the fight, packing steak knives and cleavers to boot, and they definitely help to overwhelm the Death Eaters then.
