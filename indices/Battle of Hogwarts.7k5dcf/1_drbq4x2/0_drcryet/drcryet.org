Correct me if I'm wrong as it's been several years since I last read the canon novels but wouldn't the anti-apparition charms/wards have collapsed after Voldemort and co. broke through Hogwarts' protective enchantments?

I feel as if though Dobby, perhaps due to plot reasons, was given better treatment in regards to magical proficiency than other house-elves (a plot point I'm focusing on in a fic I've been planning to write) and shouldn't be used as a baseline for other house-elves.
