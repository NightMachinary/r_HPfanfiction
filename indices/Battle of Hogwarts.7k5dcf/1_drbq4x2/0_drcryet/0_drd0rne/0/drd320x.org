I've had this really strange fan-theory for a while now revolving around house-elves and where they came from. I was originally going to write my entire theory but that would have taken quite some time so long story short, I actually believe that house-elves (or at least the majority of them) are the progeny of ancient dark wizards who were condemned to a life of servitude in order to atone for their many sins. Whatever the case may be, I firmly believe that house-elves were artificially made as what creature would possibly evolve in such a way as to be tied to another in such a subservient and inescapable role.

Much like other things in the HP universe, most spells and branches of magic were created quite some time ago. There must have been occasions where a wizard was able to escape imprisonment much like Sirius did thanks to his animagus abilities. No prison is ever truly inescapable. Thus, it would only make sense for ancient wizards to devise a new way to punish those like Voldemort and what better way but to disfigure them and turn them into creatures of servitude? I would like to think of Dobby as a recently turned house-elf who thanks to his former prowess in magic as a wizard, is able to fight off the curse much like how Harry fights off the imperio. This contributes to Dobby not only acting erratic, but it also accounts for his magical prowess.
