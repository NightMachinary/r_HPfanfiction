The interesting thing about that is that it never happens ever again in canon. Even in places where being OP wouldn't have mattered. For instance, Kreacher bashes Mudungus with a pan (which is super hilarious).

Dobby, on the other hand, under no orders from anybody whatsoever, was enchanting objects, blocking off presumably super powerful enchantments (Platform 9^{3/4} ), and then banishing Lucius.

Almost makes you wonder if Dobby was just special.
