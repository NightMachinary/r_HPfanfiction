My headcanon is that House Elves can't use magic against humans, but for Dubby it was personal. When he saw that Lucius Malfoy was going to attack Harry, the one human that treated Dobby nicely and with respect; something that Dobby wasn't used to his emotions likely got the better of him and before he could think things through ended up attacking Lucius Malfoy with magic, of course there's no evidence to support that it's illegal for a House Elf to use magic against a human, that's just my personal headcanon there.
