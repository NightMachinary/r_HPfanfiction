If I recall correctly, Dobby didn't so much beat Malfoy as blindside him. From what I remember we never saw a 'fair' fight between house elf and wizard. I don't know if I count the example you cited as convincing enough for me to deem house elves powerful in a combat sense. It is undeniable that their magic is slightly different and effective but is it effective due to power or the fact they're always overlooked?
