I can remember a fic (it was probably a Lily/James fic) that I read where James and Lupin and Sirius had a huge row over Sirius' leading Snape to see Lupin as a werewolf (I remember James yelling at Sirius because he hadn't even thought about what it would do to Lupin and his sanity if Snape had been killed) and in the aftermath of the fight, Peter acted as a tentative peacemaker, like the go-to between the parties that wouldn't speak to each other. I'm trying really hard to find this story, but I can't remember its title.
