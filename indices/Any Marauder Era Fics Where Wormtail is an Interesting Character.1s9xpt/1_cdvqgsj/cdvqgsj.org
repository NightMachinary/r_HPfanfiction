I commented on that pet peeve thread as well, but I feel I should throw it out there again: MarauderLover7's stuff ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4684913/]]) is good for Peter, I think. All of his/her stories mention Peter in some way/shape/form, but he features most prominently in these:

Furry Little Problem is when Lupins secret is uncovered, and it's how the Marauders react/confront him. Peter's not as accepting of it as Sirius and James, but he's still Lupin's friend, so he's willing to try.

Defining Moments is set around the whole Sirius-sends-Snape-after-Lupin thing from fifth? sixth? year, and Peter gets a whole chapter to himself, and cameos in other chapters. It sets up him wanting to stand out from his friends, but it's cool to see his POV.

White Flags is set in the Marauders' seventh year and has Peter featuring quite regularly. He's already dabbling in Death Eater things, which is interesting, but the author doesn't (seem to) hate him, and doesn't turn him into a complete villain or ignore him, which is a nice change.

Dark Days is set during the war (near Harry's first birthday I think?) and Peter has a whole chapter in that as well. That chapter has literally become my Peter Pettigrew headcanon because it really captures the reasons behind his decision to join the death eaters, and it made me understand him, and even feel sorry for him... and this is Wormtail we're talking about, who, aside from Umbridge, is probably the hardest character to sympathise with. It also has chapters from James and Sirius' POVs and their thoughts on Peter show him on a more equal footing with them. I distinctly remember a part about Sirius thinking Peter was brave.

Innocent isn't a Marauder era fic, but it's definitely worth a read if you don't mind AU and rather slow pace (it's at 400k words, and Harry's not even at Hogwarts) but Peter crops up as a minor character every now and then. He's definitely a bit more of a bad-guy in this, but he's not demonised, and there was this really chilling scene in there, where he's at Lily and James' graves, but I can't remember what chapter, sorry.

Also, Abide The Sleeper, by Furiosity and Imadra Blue ([[http://www.bigbang.inkubation.net/sleeper.html]]) is a good one that looks at Peter's character, set during the second wizarding war. It's a Harry/Draco fic (slash might not be your thing) but it's definitely worth a read, if only for the Peter parts. This is the best interpretation I've seen of him in the 'later' years.
