If you're okay with some Sirius/Remus (in the later chapters), [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/category/shoebox-pdf-chapters/][The Shoebox Project]] portrays Peter pretty sympathetically. He's written as that one kid in a group of friends that everyone's friends with, but nobody's /best/ friends with.

Edit to address the "unequal footing" thing. I get that the pet peeve is based on fics where Peter has no virtues or talents whatsoever, but there is precedent that he was neither as talented nor as popular as Sirius and James (McGonagall, book 3: "[Peter] hero-worshipped Black and Potter. Never quite in their league, talent-wise."), so to some extent there is always going to be some sort of imbalance.
