Thanks! I think my wording wasn't exactly correct. I was thinking more along the lines of how Peter is disdained and bullied constantly, or how he's a complete moron with no redeemable qualities, or sometimes completely ignored by writers because they don't want to write him! I think everyone has supplied great recommendations and I'm going to be busy reading them all!
