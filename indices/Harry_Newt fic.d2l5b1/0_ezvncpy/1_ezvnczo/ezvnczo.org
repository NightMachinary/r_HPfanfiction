  Harry Potter meets Cor Leonis. He is not impressed. Neither is the young Insomnian.  

  The Gryffindor paused, blinking at the stranger. He was about his age, wearing a military uniform of all things, and bristling like a Coeurl fixing to pick a fight, his boots were shiny and black, his uniform was clean and pressed, his hands and fingernails were also clean, and there wasn't a single button or seam out of place. Even his sword-sheath gleamed, shiny, clean, and flawless. Stood in blood and sweat stiffened leathers, with mud up to his thighs, dirt under his nails, across his cheeks, twigs in his hair, and his pistols dented and caked with blood after he used them to club the last of his prey to death, he felt incredibly dirty and small in front of the other teenager who was already close to hitting six foot while Harry had only just reached 5'3‚Äù.

  He hated him immediately.

  Newt/Harry, Timetravel Shenanigans, Canon Divergent. His plan was to avoid changing the timeline. He knew he wouldn't be able to resist if the opportunity presented itself. So he fled to Africa, where opportunity found him instead.
