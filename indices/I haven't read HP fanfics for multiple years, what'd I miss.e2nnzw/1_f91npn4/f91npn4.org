linkffn(13041698) started about a year ago and is updating semi-regularly. It's a clever and funny take on a self-insert who /isn't/ a Mary Sue. She gets yanked into the Harry Potter world by a magic mirror and de-aged into an 11-year-old.

  I took a swig of pumpkin juice.

  Hmm... It's... kind of like every liquid pumpkin pie spice thing I've ever had before. So it's vile and shouldn't exist. I took a few more swigs and downed the whole bottle. Pie shouldn't come in liquid form. But at least I'm not thirsty anymore.

  I glanced down at the headlines. The Holly Head Harpies had just won the semi-finals. Good for them I guess. There was a sale on self scrubbing dish sponges. Some band called 'Charmed 4U' was playing a concert in London next week. A woman was in trouble at the Ministry for trying to illegally cross-breed pegasuses and unicorns. Well, that woman was just doing God's work as far as I'm concerned.
