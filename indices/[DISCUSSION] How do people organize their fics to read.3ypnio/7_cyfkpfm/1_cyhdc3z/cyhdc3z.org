I tried Calibre for a while, but I just couldn't get into it. My biggest issue is that there's no user-friendly way to keep my whole library in sync with my devices wirelessly. It has multiple "options" for doing this, but none of them are as simple as "All of your library and metadata always stay in sync, perfectly", or even anywhere close.
