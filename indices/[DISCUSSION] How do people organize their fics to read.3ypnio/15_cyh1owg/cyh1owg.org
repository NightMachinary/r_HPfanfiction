For fics on supported websites, I use Calibre's FanFicFare plugin, which automatically imports and updates fanfics I am following and pushes them to the e-reader when they update. Once imported, a fic is just another ePub in the Calibre library. It also imports the available tagging information: genres, characters, 'ships, completeness, etc..

The big downside of this approach is that, as a result, I am very bad about leaving reviews, since I am reading a fic off an e-reader, not in a browser, and I often don't get around to coming back, browsing to the fic, and leaving the review.
