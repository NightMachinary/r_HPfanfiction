Okay so because I read multiple fics at once, I keep a list of the fics that I am currently reading. I have multiple documents for organization. A word document for the fics that I want/have to read, which is in order of urgency. I have this list organised by type of fic (ex: dark harry, AU, time-travel) as well as pairings. I have a document for the fics that I haven't finished and the fics that are currently being updated. I have a document for the fics that I have read. I usually put a description by these, so if I want to go back and read something I have something to go off of. I also use a rating system, so I know which fics are exceptionally good.
