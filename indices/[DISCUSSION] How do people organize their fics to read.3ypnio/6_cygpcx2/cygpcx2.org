I read one fic at a time, and I have bookmark like crazy. I don't even know how deep the folders go, but it's deep. Anything I might want to read again gets bookmarked. The truly excellent get favorited, and I follow anything that I want updates on so that I only have to pay attention to my email inbox.

If I think I might want to read it offline, then I'll download it through the fanfiction.net app, which I really like.
