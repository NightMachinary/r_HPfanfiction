As I scroll through my bookmarked FFN search page (parameters preset, I think I have 3 of these bookmarks saved, sorted different ways; favorite one is the 60k+ words, complete, English, sorted by recently updated) if I find something that seems interesting and I don't /think/ I've read it already, I'll bookmark it. I'll often find 2-3 to bookmark before I actually start reading one. I have like 20 stories in my bookmarks that I have to get around to reading.

I don't organize those bookmarks, I delete a bookmark after I've read it, because if I like it, I'll favorite it on FFN. That's kinda why my favorites list seems to sketchy sometimes Every so often I'll go through my favorites and download onto my Kindle the ones I want to perma-save. Occasionally if one story is absolutely amazing, I'll bookmark it through mobile Chrome instead (which I can easily get to on my desktop) so that it's already in the folder of things to download.
