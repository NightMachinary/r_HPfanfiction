Ugh, I've got this bookmarks folder for stories that have been updated in the past year, and every so often when I'm bored I go through and see if any are finished or seem abandoned. My friends made fun of me so hard when they found out. It works for me, though.

edit: have you checked out the ff.net app? I'm not sure how well it works, but I know you can download stories with it.
