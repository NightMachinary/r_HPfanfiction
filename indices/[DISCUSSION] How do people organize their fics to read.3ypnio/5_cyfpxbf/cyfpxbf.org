I created a google doc to organize all the fanfic I read. It started out as a way to record what fics I've finished, but then it tuned into this huge monster. I have each section categorized by ship (Draco Malfoy + Hermione Granger, Reading the Books, Crossovers, etc). Then I have a format for each entry. I'll post an example further down. A few months ago, I added the genre the fic falls under, along with if the fic is considered popular or not (based on how many reviews/hits/favorites etc). I also color code the title, rating, ship, status (complete, incomplete, WIP, abandoned), and an asterisk (*) if a fic was memorable (could be positive or negative. If negative, it means I most likely abandoned reading it).

*Basic Example*

Title: Rating

/Link(s)/

Trope: Summary. Genre. Smut (if applicable), Popular (if applicable). *if particularly memorable (for whatever reason).

Ship(s) Status Chapter count Last update

[Status of reading] *(favorite if applicable)

For fics I've heard about, but haven't checked them out, I put under a separate category at the bottom of my document. For fics that I am interested in reading, I file it into whichever category fits it best, but do not add the [status of reading].

*Here's an actual example from my document:*

Them Boys: T

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8587646/13/Them-Boys]]

Time Turner: Hermione is sent back in time to the Marauders Era. Now she goes to school with people she only knows as being dead, Hogwarts Professors and an Azkaban Escapee. She's stuck in the â€˜70s living a life where she is falling in love with a Marauder. And Hermione will do ANYTHING to keep the friends she's made from the fate she knows will befall them without her interference. Albus is acting as Hermione's Godfather. Everyone is at Potter Manor for Christmas. Romance/Humor

[Reading: Chapter 13] *

I do also have some fics I want to read categorized on my phone in folders. The folders are under "Fanfiction", then four folders relating to fics (websites that host fics or have recs, new fics I haven't checked, fics I'm in the middle of reading, and one shots). There are several more folders under the fics I haven't read and I categorize them by ship. For each bookmark I do the following: Title Rating Ship Chapter Count. And * before the title means I enjoyed my skim through and have high hopes for the fic and a * after the chapter count means it is a popular fic.

My /in-progress/ bookmarks is the same, except instead of total character count, I put what chapter I am on. So if a fic has 50 chapters and I've read 12, it would be shown as 12/50.
