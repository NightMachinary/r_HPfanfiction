By whatever the original work was (“Harry Potter”, for example, or “Star Wars”), then for each work by whether it's a one-shot, few-shot (up to 5 chapters, no more than 20.000 words total), longer work, or a series (and each series gets its own sub-folder). If needed because of works sharing the same name and being in the same category, I add tags that are as general as possible while still allowing me to differentiate between the two quickly.

Also, if some fan fiction is the only one I care about about a given work, it goes to the “assorted” folder instead because having a whole category for one work is kind of absurd.
