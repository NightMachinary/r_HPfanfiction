I've bookmarked a few filters for FF.net's HP category and this reddit. I systematically browse through them, bookmark any story that seems interesting, read story, deciding whether to discard or finish within the first few chapters. When I run out of stories I go back to the bookmarked search locations and start over. I tend to edit the names with dates so I don't forget how long I have to look back. I also have mail alerts for any updates to fics I follow on FF.net. Works wonderfully since I get to do it on both my tablet and PC.
