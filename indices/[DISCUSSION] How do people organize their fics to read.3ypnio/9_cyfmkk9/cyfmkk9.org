For ongoing stories I follow them on ao3 or ff so they send new chapters to my email. For stories to read I have a huge Fanfiction bookmark folder- no sorting, just any ff that I haven't read yet.

Once I finish reading a fic or it gets completed it gets complicated. I use evernote because I really hate not being able to remember things I've read. I'm way behind but for fics worth recommending I create a note, put the description in as well as anything I want to add and the author and then I have an elaborate tagging system by ship, rating, tropes, type of story, etc. So if I want to find a particular ship I click on that tag but evernote is also searchable by text so I'll just use that too.
