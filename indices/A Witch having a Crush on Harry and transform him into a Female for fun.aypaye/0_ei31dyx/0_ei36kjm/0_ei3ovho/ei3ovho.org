I remember one where Harry teases Malfoy to fuck with his head after voluntarily taking a gender swap potion to mess with the TWT, but that one is kinda a double-edged sword. It has some very sweet interactions between Harry and her honorary sister Luna, but it also constantly spouts "all boys are stupid/perverts" to the point where it gets annoying and you wonder if perhaps the author has some underlying trauma. I mean, we are perverts, but not more so than women.

The "Malfoy turns him into a girl has a drunken shopping trip with Bellatrix Lestrange though. And throws a lot less shade.
