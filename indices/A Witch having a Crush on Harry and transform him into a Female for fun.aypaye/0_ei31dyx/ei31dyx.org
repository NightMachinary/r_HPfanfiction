I don't think I've ever read magical feminization out of attraction. I've seen "polyjuice shenanigan", "Harry gets turned into a girl by Malfoy but enjoys her new persona" and "the assistant of Dr Granger makes Harry act like a girl because she's into it", but not what you are describing. And especially not with magic.
