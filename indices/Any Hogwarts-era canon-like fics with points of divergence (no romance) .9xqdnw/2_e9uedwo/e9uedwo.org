  classes are still a part of Harry's life, as well as friends, and no one is massively overpowered or bashed or super ooc

My own "No Longer Alone" fits this. Basically, Harry is fed up with Hermione and Ron fighting all the time over their pets, so he hangs out with Katie Bell and her friend Leanne instead (there is a reconciliation with both when they are back to Hogwarts). This leads to a slightly different confrontation between Pettigrew and Sirius (Pettigrew ends up kissed). So with no evidence of his innocence, Sirius flees and gets in touch with Andromeda, who takes Harry in.

The story is more family-focused than canon, but that is to be expected given the premise. There is a romantic subplot in two chapters (out of currently 15), but it is a tentative teenage romance, not "true love"^{TM} and or marriage at 14. Pretty free of bashing (well, Pomfrey gets shade thrown her way for not recognising child abuse and there is some bad blood between Molly and Andromeda in the background, but definitely no random love potions or stolen money), Dumbledore barely plays a role (he has one scene in Chapter 14) and stays out of things. Harry is roughly a year ahead in DADA and half a year in Charms, but worse in transifiguration than in canon.

tl;dr: Harry + adoptive family (the Tonks) + friends (mostly Katie Bell and Hermione) + life at Hogwarts
