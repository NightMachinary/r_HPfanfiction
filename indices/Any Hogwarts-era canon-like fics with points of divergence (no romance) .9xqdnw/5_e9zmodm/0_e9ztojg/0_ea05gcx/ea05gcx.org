Actually, you answered my question pretty well. That was exactly what I was wondering as I figured including obvious LGBT elements would increase the amount backlash Harry would deal with. Honestly though, I think it would be interesting to have Harry as the MC, but have another character be faced with LGBT isssues. Then we could have a Harry who's forced to witness someone else deal with personal and social issues and maybe that will inspire him to be a social activist? I just see Harry as someone who reacts more about other people's personal dificulties than his own.
