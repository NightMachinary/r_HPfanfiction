I don't see how him being gay or bi would be incompatible with the vibes of the original ? the â€˜vibes' in the original are mostly just kids bookishly interested in friendship and classes and plot and novel-pacing, which I'm interested in. the wizarding world is likely homophobic bc it's very heteronormative from what we see and there are no out lgbt ppl, but you could have homophobia in a kids book w/t it being depressing. I'm not necessarily looking for something appropriate for 9-year olds (I don't mind swearing obvs or violence or adult themes) and if harry can deal w abuse and ptsd and the death of his family and friends and a terrorist organisation out to torture and kill him since birth I don't think dealing w being gay/bi would suddenly make things inappropriate or bizarre. anyway he could easily not deal w much homophobia. It's up to the author. I don't get what you mean at all.
