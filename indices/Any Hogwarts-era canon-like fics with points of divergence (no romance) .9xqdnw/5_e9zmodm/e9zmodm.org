[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9969014/1/Seasons-of-change][Seasons of change]] is only midway through year 2 so no romance yet, but it's a really good one. Basically, Harry is a kinder version of himself.

In canon, Harry is clearly written as heterosexual, so I'm not sure how him not being heterosexual would keep to the vibes of the original? The magical world may not care about sexual orientation, but the muggle world does and Harry is still firmly entrenched in there until he's 17.
