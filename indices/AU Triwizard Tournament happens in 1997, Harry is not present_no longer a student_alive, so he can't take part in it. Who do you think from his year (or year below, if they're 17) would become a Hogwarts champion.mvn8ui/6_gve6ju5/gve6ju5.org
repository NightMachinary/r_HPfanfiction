I think that unlike most responses here, I don't think that Hermione would make the best champion. It's not her over-reliance on written knowledge that would hinder her. In fact Dumbledore states that the criteria on which champions are judged are: magical prowess, daring, powers of deduction and ability to cope with danger. While Hermione fulfills most of the criteria, if we disregard her movie superpowers, she is not that good at dealing with stressful situations and usually gets flustered then. We know very little about the rest of the people in Harry's year and other than Ginny, Luna and Colin we don't even know anything about those in the year below. I'd say Ginny would be the most suitable candidate since she seems to be reasonably good at magic, pretty resourceful and a courageous girl, but she is also too young so assuming the age restrictions are still in place, she would not qualify. I am not very sure about Ron either considering that despite being a reasonable fit for most of the criteria, he has stage fright and would just end up losing his head in front of a crowd.

Maybe someone outside of Harry's gang? If you're looking to incorporate this in your own fic... Neville would be quite a twist. Or you can always go with someone that we don't know much about. Ernie is reasonably good with magic and judging by how outspoken he is, he could probably fulfill the other criteria as well.
