Assuming that the Tournament didn't happen earlier because Harry wasn't at the school and therefore Dumbledore didn't need to bring the foreign schools over to make alliances... then Harry must have dealt with Voldemort before then, permanently.

Hermione wouldn't have her association with Harry to boost her prominence in society and open doors into the Ministry, nor would Slughorn be around to open those doors for her. Given that, she'd be the best candidate to champion the school and willing to do it in order to serve her greater ambitions.
