I'm not convinced Hermione would be the best possible Champion. Even if she is brillant, the girl clearly has a researcher mindset and is not made for the field. In Canon, we have several situation where she just "freeze" in the middle of a stressfull situation (Devil Snare, DoM battle, Confrontation against Nagini . . .) and I'm afraid it would also happen during a Task.

But the problem is that, as you said, we don't know how the Goblet select the Champions. If he is only looking as pure knowledge, if he is also taking other qualities into account such as one's composure, there are probably several other student better suited than Hermione to be a Champion. I would consider Ron, and maybe even Neville (though in his case I'm not convinced he has enough theorical knowledge despite his bravery) as safer bet. And that's without mentioning all the other "of age" student we don't know anything of (such as the ones you mentioned).
