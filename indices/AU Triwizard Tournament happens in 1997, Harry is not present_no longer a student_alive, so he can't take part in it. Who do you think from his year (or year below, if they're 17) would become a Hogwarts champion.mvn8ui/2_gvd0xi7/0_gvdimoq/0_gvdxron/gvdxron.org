  Even if she is brillant, the girl clearly has a researcher mindset and is not made for the field. In Canon, we have several situation where she just "freeze" in the middle of a stressfull situation (Devil Snare, DoM battle, Confrontation against Nagini . . .) and I'm afraid it would also happen during a Task.

While that is true, she has also been seen to think on her feet at times (leading Umbridge to the centaurs, disfiguring Harry's face when the Snatchers showed up), and she did still hold her own in some fights.

Plus, the Tournament does encourage and reward research and preparation. The second task did so explicitly, the first task wasn't meant to, but still did, and the third task kind of half did.

I still think she's the best option based on what we know from canon, but as we've both said, that doesn't really mean much.
