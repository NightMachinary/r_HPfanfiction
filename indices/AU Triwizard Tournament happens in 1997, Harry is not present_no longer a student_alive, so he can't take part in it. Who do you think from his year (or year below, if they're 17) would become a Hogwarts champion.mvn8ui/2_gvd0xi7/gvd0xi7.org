We don't really know what the Goblet's criteria for choosing champions was. It could honestly be completely random, for all we know.

But if it does pick based on capability somehow, I do think Hermione is the best option we have. Her objections were more based on the fact that the tournament was too dangerous for underage students to participate in. As a seventh year, I can imagine her thinking that she would be capable enough to handle whatever they throw at her. If she was still going to choose not to participate, it would be because it would get in the way of studying for her NEWTS. And realistically, that probably would be enough to convince her not to enter.

The next best option from canon is probably Neville, assuming that he still got all the character growth he did by the end of canon, and then Ron. And then we're basically out of characters who we know enough about from canon to really judge. Maybe Susan Bones or Padma Patil or Ernie Macmillan would have been a fantastic champion, but we have no way to know.
