It depends. If the war against Voldemort happened and hermione fought in it, then her.

If not I could see it being a toss up between hermione, Neville or draco(even if I hate draco he is good with a wand, just less than harry)

All three of them could qualify for diferent reasons.

I would still put my money on hermione. She is always been powerfull, knowledgable and quick to result to violence/fighting I can definetly see her winning too. Just not as solidly if she didn't fight in the war
