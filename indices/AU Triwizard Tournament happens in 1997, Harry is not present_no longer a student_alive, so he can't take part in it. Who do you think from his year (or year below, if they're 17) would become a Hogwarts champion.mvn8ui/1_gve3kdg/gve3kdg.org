*Hermione will probably become Champion if she enters.* We don't have many data points, but the Goblet seems to like well-rounded candidates like Cedric, who was a 6th-year selected over 7th-years, and it picked Fleur even though she wasn't, in all evidence, much of a fighter. (For these reasons, I would also predict that a hypothetical 7th-year Hermione who hadn't had to deal with Harry-related adventures would probably get picked over a hypothetical 7th-year Harry who had been raised by the Dursleys but had not otherwise had to deal with Voldemort or his agents.)

If Hermione doesn't enter, I think Ron might be a good candidate. He is competent for his year, and he has something to prove---more so if his ambition isn't assuaged by his friendship with Harry.

*How Hermione would perform is a separate question, but I'd give her good odds.* In canon, all of the Champions learned about all of the tasks to varying extents, so nobody really had to improvise in the first place. But, even if they had to go in blind, the tasks themselves weren't ones to force the Champions to "think fast": for example, they could have been placed within the dragon's reach or dropped straight in the middle of the lake or in the middle of the maze, but they were instead given space and time to think at the start of each task. And so, in canon-style tasks, the enormous arsenal of magic Hermione would have by Year 7 and her general knowledge both would give her the advantage.

With respect to things like combat skills---and this is getting into headcanon territory---NEWT years is when those students who continue to study DADA begin to transition from the adolescent style of magical combat, which features a lot of movement and infrequent and relatively weak spells cast verbally, to a more adult one, in which one stands one's ground while engaging in a rapid exchange of a wide variety of nonverbally cast spells---each of which likely ends the fight if it connects---and counterspelling and shielding. (Compare, the adolescent duels we see to Molly vs. Bellatrix in DH.) But, the adult style plays to Hermione's strengths (versatility, arsenal, nonverbal casting, Transfiguration?)---and as a legitimate Hogwarts Champion she would have no shortage of sparring partners if she needed to develop practical skills.
