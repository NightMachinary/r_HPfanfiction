Ron was the guy who screamed Dobby's name in Malfoy Manor almost giving them away. He was the one who forgot he had magic and wanted Crookshanks to tap the base of the Whomping Willow in the Battle of Hogwarts (ie. "Are you a wizard or not?").

Ron does not unilaterally think better under pressure. He has good moments and bad moments - just like Hermione.
