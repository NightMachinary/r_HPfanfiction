If Hermione fought in the war, then her freezing in tough situations would have been mostly fixed. As for not being able to think on her feet or being terrible at improvisation, that is incorrect. From Umbridge and the centaurs, to the Lovegood house, to Malfoy Manor, Hermione has been shown over and over again to be great at improvisation.

It is more likely that she refused to participate at all than she tried to join and the Goblet did not pick her if we are assuming that it chooses contestants on sheer ability alone.
