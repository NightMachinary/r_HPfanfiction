Yes. I clicked on this thread to recc this fic! Soul Scars is really, really good in an area that's really hard to do in any positive way.

It's also one of the only H/multi stories that felt remotely possible, relationship dynamic-wise (I felt the author considered a lot of the reasons why it's so difficult for a polyamorous relationship to function well). It was a solid read, IMO!
