Obligatory mention of [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54][The Meaning of One]] (on SIYE, so no bot), which is complete up to the end of year two but probably won't go further than that. Harry and Ginny have been custom designed by the universe to be the perfect match, and they share every thought and sensation unless they actively concentrate on something else to distract themselves.

It could easily have become too saccharine, but I think that the author got it right and instead just made it a story of them being completely united and loyal to each other, which is nice to read. And their shared life has its own challenges, especially in second year when one is petrified and the other has to deal with the sudden loss of their companion and half their identity.
