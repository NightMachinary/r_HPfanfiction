I request of some of my favorite things! There are a few civilization building fics out there and it might be worth looking through these threads: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4xe42j/request_looking_for_fics_with_a_magical_exodus/][exodus fics]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4r5eee/lf_harry_potter_survivor/][survivor fics]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4t7lac/lf_fics_where_harry_has_a_space_ship_cause_why_not/][space ship fics]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4xi9uz/any_civilizationbuilding_fics/][civilization building]]

In [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2849816][Space Haven]], the residents of an besieged Hogwarts travel via hidden gate to Atlantis and must get everything working again. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2320601/1/Under-Siege][Under Siege]] Hogwarts is locked down, but again, they have everything they need and it's more about building a community. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3450026][The Wizard Beyond The Walls]] fits a little bit? It is abandoned before the heavy duty community building though. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3999286][FeS2]] was inspired by Xerosis and has a similar storyline but they take over a hidden world rather then the moon. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] has been moving to 'create an island for magicals' as well.

A group of students uses a defective portray in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4014733][The ever-changing tide]] (a Naruto crossover) just like Islands of Fire. It isn't as good as IoF, but still worth a read.

For slightly off topic stories: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7398966/1/The-Ark-and-the-Desert][The Ark and the Desert]] most of Hogwarts ends ups on a distant world and has to terraform it to survive, but gets a bit bogged down in strange science. In Esama's Tumbling HP Crossovers [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1647644/chapters/3492878][Chapter 2: Because Why Not]] Harry ends up on a asteroid and has to terraform it. Likewise, in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1647644/chapters/3493007][Chapter 5: Forest Spirit]] Harry ends up with a seemingly sentient forest. [[/u/viol8er]] aka Cole Pascal's story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10622535/1/][A Trek to the Stars: The Potter Files]] also has Harry interacting with an established magical society on a distant planet, and causing some major changes. He comes in later, but it goes into detail, so may be worth a go.
