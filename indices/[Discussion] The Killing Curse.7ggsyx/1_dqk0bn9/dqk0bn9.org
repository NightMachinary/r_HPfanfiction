I see all three Unforgivables as the quintessential Soul Magic. The Killing Curse, like a Basilisk's Gaze, sends a jolt of magic through one's body that instantly kicks your soul into the beyond and shuts down the entire body's processes. (A miscast curse, like reflected Basilisk's Gaze, could have erratic effects such as Petrification.)

I would say that it is probably impossible to shock the body back to life from a Killing Curse --- if it did anything at all, the result would be a mindless shell like the victim of a Dementor's Kiss.
