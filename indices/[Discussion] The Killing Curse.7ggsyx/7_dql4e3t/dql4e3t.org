This question makes a mess in my head.

The first problem is obviously that "dead" and "alive" are just definitions that don't refer to an actual state of being, but to a complex mess of processes that science has only recently been able to define as anything but the rather magical definitions of "dead" and "alive". You have to remember that death and life and the soul are nothing but a bunch of archaic hypotheses for how this thing we call "life" actually operates.

So then what does a curse that changes these states actually mean in real life? Well, rather little I imagine. There isn't actually such a thing as dead or alive, that's just a convenient word we use do describe states of what we call organisms. We don't call a boat "dead" or "alive", but we might as well as the moment where a shell blows a hole in its hull that leads to catastrophic failure is pretty damn analogous to "time of death" in humans if you think about it. Or at least the moment it's underwatter is.

And to stick with the boat analogy. Even a sunken ship can theoretically be lifted out of the water, repeared and made sea worthy again. (though would it be the same ship? now there's a question.)

So by analogy, a dead human can be made to be alive again with a little imagination. Anything absolutely preventing this is just a forced plot device in my opinion, although I can only think of one fic that took this to its extreme and actually completely revived a person that had been dead for half of the fic in a non spooky necromantic soul magicky way.

So, to get back the the question, what does the killing curse do? The answer? It's up to you! If it weren't for the whole kings-cross return from the dead scene, I'd say that it's a lack of knowledge and a false assumption of death being absolute that leads to the wizarding worlds understanding of how the killing curse works. I'd say "the light going out of someones eyes" is the probably the light of recognition, and death is the lack of the experience of life in the victim of the curse. So, complete brain shutdown most likely. The fact that the heart doesn't beat either (presumable) makes me thing it achieves this through a stop to all electrical processes in the body, including the heart's pace-maker. I don't know enough about medicine or biology to say how this could be reversed, but I see no reason why any such method wouldn't work on a victim of the avada, except for some connection to soul magic. The just add the resurrection stone to the mix and bob's your uncle.
