A levitation charm has the target pass from a state of "not levitating" to a state of "levitating"; in the same way, the killing curse has the target going from the state "not dead" to the state "dead": ot only has the soul left the body (as it would have after a Dementor kiss), but the body left behind is dead by all known measures : the heart does not beat anymore, synapses are not firing anything, every single biological function has stopped. Shocking the body back to life won't work anymore than shocking my fridge to life would (probably less, depending on what may be living in my fridge).\\
Basically: it's magic, seeking a scientific modus operandi is time wasted
