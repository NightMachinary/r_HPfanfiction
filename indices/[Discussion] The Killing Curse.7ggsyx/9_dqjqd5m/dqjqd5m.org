You could probably shock the body back to life but afaik the curse rips out the victim's soul. At best, unless you managed to prevent the soul from leaving the mortal plane (via horcruxes or other techniques) you would just have the equivalent of a Kissed Dementor victim - a vegetable, alive only in the strictest definition of the word.
