The explanation, would contradict canon, though, if something has been done to every organ, to every cell that would stop it from working, as you call it forgetting how to work, to the point that electrical stimuli would do nothing, I´m not sure if that´s what you meant, the body wouldn´t be considered healthy, you have to fundamentally change a body to stop it from working, even with outside stimuli. I have two theories how the Killing Curse could work, the first is that it stops every electrical impulse and nothing else, which would mean cpr would work, I say even if the shutting down is only a side effect of removing the soul, the soul would come back to the body, if resuscitation is successful, and it should be nearly 100% successful, if it starts in a timely manner, by people who know what they´re doing, especially because the body shouldn´t be damaged. The second theory, which was inspired by your headcanon, is that Avada Kedavra is an enchantment, that only works on living beings and backfires on non living objects. The enchantment absorbs electrical energy and stops the cells from absorbing oxygen. The body would appear healthy, but no muggle doctor could possibly find out the cause, the problem would be that wizards should be able to detect the enchantment, you could explain it that this enchantment is almost impossible to detect, but I think this would be just explaining it with more magic, it could be though that the way the spell acts precisely isn´t taught to most, because it is for most people useless knowledge, Aurors and civilians only need to know that the spell kills people, and this only really comes up in academic conversations.
