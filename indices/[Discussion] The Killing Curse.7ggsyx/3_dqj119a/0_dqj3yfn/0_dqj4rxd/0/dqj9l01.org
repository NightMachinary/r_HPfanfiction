That´s where, I´m not sure if I understood you right, I understood that the organs aren´t capable of doing their function, at all, even with the help of outside stimuli (electricity,cpr). I stumbled on your explanation, that it removes hardcoded stuff, but that´s not quite how the body works. I`m no expert, but to simplify it, you could say that the brain is like a computer and the rest is a simple machine(of course it is more complicated and not a 100% true), like a clock work, there is nothing programmed in it, it can only do what the brain says, if you want to inhibit the clock work you have to damage the gears. What you call hardcoded is the structure of the organs and if you erase the hardcoded stuff, you damage the very structure, it has to be physically changed. While I singled out the brain, it doesn´t actually work much differently everything it does works because of it´s very structure, electricity for the most part is just the fuel, cut it off, and the machine stops working, switch it back on it works like before, our very memories are stored physically in our brain, it just needs electricity to gain access. To make a body forget how it works, you have to fundamentally change it´s structure, and such a body wouldn´t be considered healthy, maybe on first glance, but with further examination, you would find out that there´s something fundamentally wrong with the body. Then again I´m still not a 100% sure if I understood you right and again I´m no expert.
