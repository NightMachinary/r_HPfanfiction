The cells start dying after 6 minutes, but brain activity stops a few seconds after the heart stops beating there are cases were brain activity lasts up to ten minutes after death, but those seem to be outliers, it usually seems to be 20-30 seconds. Though I give you that, this data comes from experiments with animals and may not apply to humans, right now there seems to be more interest in studying this, so those 20-30 seconds could be wrong, but this is still the general assumption. There are also cases were people who were declared brain dead woke up, but those could´ve been simple misdiagnosis´s and even if they´re not, they´re outliers. Quite frankly we´re both not medical professionals, at least I assume you aren´t, so our knowledge is limited to what we heard before and everything I heard comes from people for whom it, is irrelevant if the brain activity stops after a few minutes or a few seconds because it doesn´t change what they have to do to save lives, so I guess it is presumptuous of me to say something is certainly this way, even though I´m no expert and even the professionals aren´t completely sure. So what I want to say is maybe you are wrong, maybe I am wrong, so sorry for wasting your time and the commas are a bad habit that I try to fix :D
