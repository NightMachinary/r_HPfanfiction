  Basically, the spell signals the body to shut down or manipulates the existing nervous system into shutting down.

Well, in my random theory, sure.

  Now, I get it, and it this case cpr would work right?

No. CPR is used to get the heart running again, to get blood running throughout the body --- not permanently either, but rather to give the person enough time to get the real help they need from a medical personnel. That's all.

CPR doesn't get your brain working if it's already dead. If the electric pulses between the neurons get extinguished, there's no bringing them back. Theoretically, there could be a way, but our modern science isn't that advanced. It isn't as simple as zapping someone with electricity.

Three things happen when you die.

1) Your heart stops.

2) Your breathing stops.

3) Your brain stops.

CPR can fix the first one, but only temporarily, and rarely. The only way it would fix the second one was if you had something stuck in your throat and the pressure from CPR dislodged it. It wouldn't do anything to the third one though.

*TL;DR:* If your brain stops working, you're fucked.
