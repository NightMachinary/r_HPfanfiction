You use cpr to get the heart beating so the cells are getting supplied with oxygen, so the brain doesn´t get irreparably damaged, because of a lack of oxygen. If, your heart stops beating, the brain shuts down completely, then your basically dead, and your gonna stay that way, if you don´t get a cpr. If you get brought into hospital the personnel doesn´t do much different than continuing the cpr, they may use machines or drugs to raise the chances, but they´re pumping until the heart starts beating on it´s own or if so much time went by that, resuscitation is unlikely to work, the important part is to supply the brain with oxygen before it takes irreparable damage. The chances are slim to come back after the heart stops beating, but not impossible. Also one of the first thins you do when finding an unconscious person is to check if they breathe, and even before that you make sure that nothing is in the mouth, if there is something you have to remove that, if there´s no breathing after that, you start with the cpr, because either the heart stopped beating or the person has ventricular fibrilation, for the latter an AED really raises the chance of survival. Also people don´t breathe long after their heart stops, maybe a few seconds, that´s why mechanical ventilation is important after the professionals take over, because the body usually has enough oxygen in the blood stream that pumping is enough until an ambulance shows up. Usually if you get the heart to beat by itself again, breathing should also start by itself except something´s stuck in the wind pipe, but this isn´t much of a concern if you provide first aide, paramedics can intubate or just use tracheal tube, heck I´m allowed to use a tracheal tube after my last course. Um, I went on a tangent there... TL;DR: If your brain stops working, your only mostly fucked. Also I had to look some words up, so there might be some mistakes, also because I found out Wikipedia isn´t clear on it, intubation is a way different beast than just shoving down a tube someones throat and sticking an ambu bag on the other end.
