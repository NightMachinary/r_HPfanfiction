Mate, you use a lot of unnecessary commas. It makes your comments rather frustrating to read.

#+begin_quote
  You use cpr to get the heart beating so the cells are getting supplied with oxygen, so the brain doesn´t get irreparably damaged, because of a lack of oxygen.
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  If, your heart stops beating, the brain shuts down completely, then your basically dead, and your gonna stay that way, if you don´t get a cpr.
#+end_quote

No, you're wrong. Your brain doesn't shut down completely if your heart stops. It can stay alive for around 6 minutes without oxygen getting to it. It starts to die only after those 6 minutes. This is the point of CPR. You cause the blood to make its way to the brain, supplying it with more oxygen. If you stop CPR, the person will eventually die if help is not reached quickly.

The rest of your comment isn't even disagreeing with me.
