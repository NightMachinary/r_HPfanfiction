I always thought that it evicts the "soul" (We know that souls exist in HP, after all Harry has had that meeting at King's Cross with Dumbledore who was dead at that time! Not to mention that Tom split his soul into several pieces!)...so it doesn't kill, as much as it removes what keeps the body alive (so that the body remains as a dead shell!)
