Interesting thought about that- do you suppose that having a horcrux makes Voldemort impervious to the Killing Curse? Or at least, leaves him able to return and re-inhabit his body within moments of being 'killed', making it little more than an inconvenience?

If so (and I'm warming to this as headcanon), would he still feel the pain-beyond-pain that happened when he failed to kill Harry, or would it only be a very difficult Stunning spell for him?
