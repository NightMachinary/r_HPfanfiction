  That doesn't mean that's the correct explanation.

Well no, that's a fair point. But I do think J.K. intended for it to be taken as such.

  'Of course it's all in your head'. It's entirely in his head. That's made clear.

Why take that information from Dumbledore at face-value then? Not that I disagree, I never suggested it was anywhere but his head. If I were a higher power that wanted to allow my dude Dumbles to visit my dude Harry I'd definitely use the perfectly functional simulation machine that was right there, e.g. Harry's brain, though, so that's neither here nor there.

Anyway, so you believe that everything that happened in kings cross was a dream that had no bearing on reality, and the reason Harry survived the killing curse was just never answered in the books?
