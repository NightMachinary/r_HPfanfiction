  What?
#+end_quote

The reason the killing curse didn't kill him, it was his blood which anchored him to this world according to "Dumbledore".

  He's not returning from anywhere. He's waking up from a dream.
#+end_quote

Most people just die when hit with that curse. They don't go to dreamland. The book quite explicitly suggests that he's being sent to a kind of purgatory where he has a choice to return, why would you assume that's not what happened?

#+begin_quote
  He knows that Voldemort ripped his soul apart.

Yes, but he seemed quite surprised and confused when confronted with the manifestation of that, why would he be confused? Do you think the dream is his subconscious informing him of things he didn't consciously know yet?
