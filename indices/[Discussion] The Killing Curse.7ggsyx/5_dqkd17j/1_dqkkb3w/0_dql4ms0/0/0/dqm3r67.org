Not just a random dream though, it was quite relevant to the situation and contained information that Harry would have had a hard time knowing beforehand. I agree it's probably like a dream in the sense that it's something that happens in your head and simulates stuff too. Are you arguing that it was "just" a dream though? Because in that case, where did the knowledge come from?
