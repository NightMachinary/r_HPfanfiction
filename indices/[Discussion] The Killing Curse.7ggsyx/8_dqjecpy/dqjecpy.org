I've thought on the mechanics of it. My head fanon is:

In a world where souls exist the body physically develops to depend on them in some way. In the case of HPverse the neurotransmitter exchange that takes place within nerve cells to communicate information does not add up to the result that is produced. If technology could account for all molecules in the human body muggles would discover that the body should not actually function. The soul is an unobservable quantity that makes it work.

The killing curse places a soul ward on a body that prevents a soul from occupying it. This results in a lifeless corpse but also less well known it also results in a corpse that cannot be possessed because it is warded from soul occupancy. You could technically batter ghosts and other spirits with a corpse that has been killed like this because the body is completely solid to them. You could also hypothetically transfigure one of these corpses into a sword and the sword would work on ethereal undead.

This also means that when muggles get to star-trek levels of technology they will be able to extrapolate the existence of souls from the information that is missing. The same way you know the shape of a missing puzzle piece.
