There's Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach) which has a religious subplot. Basically, there's a ghost of an old testament prophet who decides to interact with society again now that everyone knows about magic, and he's completely flabbergasted that there's now three abrahamic religions. He tries to reconcile Christianity, Judaism and Islam into one religion but only really achieves to create a fourth. Apart from him, reactions to magic vary from "cool, can we use it to power a spaceship?" to "wizards are all of the devil and must be killed!". There's multiple religious extremist groups targeting wizards, the common enemy manages to somehow get a group of Bible Belt christian extremists to ally with Al-Qaida, and they try to use a plane as a weapon against a wizarding community.
