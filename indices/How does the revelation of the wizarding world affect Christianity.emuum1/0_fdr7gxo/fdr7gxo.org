this is so fucking loaded religon and reddit is a bad idea

Honestly nothing changes, religion is built on faith plus Jesus is said to have raised the dead something magic can not do might lead to some issues though

Islam has less trouble due to the fact mohammad was merely a prophet and did not have magical powers as I recall

Buddism wouldnt be affected by magic from what I know of it

Lots of religious text books are thousands of years old and are often writting as a bunch of stories which can be taken dozens of different ways

so I imagine with the reveal of wizards some religious people would start looking at passages differently and being like it means this now

but lots of fun times ahead maybe violence, maybe not
