- In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]], Harry made a bargain with Time to defeat Voldemort. Every time he dies, he jumps back to the summer Sirius died. I gobbled it up the first time I read through, but is less good on the reread. That said, it definitely picks up from the first few chapters. The author has recently completed the sequel. I'm recommending it because the world does feel bigger than Rowling's text.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10678911/chapters/23643603][Blood Magic]] is another old classic and one of the original Severitus fics. Harry receives a letter from his parents on his sixteenth birthday revealing that Snape is his bio-dad (not an affair or a rape, like I've seen elsewhere; this was planned). It's got an expanded world with explanations of how magic works, wizarding customs, and more. It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/977214][The Accidental Animagus]] universe is still being updated. Harry escapes the Dursleys with accidental magic and ends up at the Grangers. Frequently recommended. The author has a great expansion on the Magical World.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is an extremely imaginative AU that is updated pretty frequently. I enjoyed this so much I read the author's crossover with Naruto. I don't even watch anime. This was also one of my gateways into the Harry has a Horcrux in his head that talks. The universe feels big in this one.

Happy reading!
