First off: no one gets to be a good writer without being a bad writer first. It takes time and practice, just like playing an instrument! Keep going.

Secondly, just because something seems boring or terrible to you about your writing, doesn't necessarily mean that it's bad. You've read it 100 times so it's going sound bad. Keep going, and write anyway.

Thirdly, confidence is key. Don't tell yourself and other people that your writing is bad, or you might start to believe it and become discouraged. You'll never become a better writer if you sabotage yourself with doubts. So keep writing!

Lastly, even if the story sucks or it never gets published, so still wrote the damn thing. You were vulnerable and shared a bit of the largeness in your soul with the world. That takes a lot of guts and should be commended. You should be proud of your accomplishment. For your next story, keep writing, and it will be better than the first!
