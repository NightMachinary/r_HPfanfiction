My theory is like this. You only need to be brave to summon the Sword from the Hat. Anything that happens to the Sword afterwards does not matter. If Dumbledore did not hide the real sword it would have fallen to Scrimgeour. If Snape did not hide the real sword it would have gone to Bellatrix. There is nothing stopping this from happening. No special powers needed to wield it. Exceptional bravery is only required to summon it from the Sorting Hat as it happened with Neville.
