Except if that was the case, it would have already been in the Headmaster's office. It only came to be in the Headmaster's office after it was pulled out of the Hat by Harry. Until then, it's previous location was unknown. Also, if it would be returned back to Headmaster's office if it was not taken under conditions of need and valor, then there was no need for either Dumbledore or Snape to hide the sword from the ministry or death eaters by making a fake. They would have been assured that it would have returned to the Headmaster's office and not worried about it.

No, the 'Need and Valor' is required for pulling the Sword out of the Hat as Harry and Neville did. But, once it is out of the Hat, it will remain there until another person needs the Sword and has access to the Hat.

Also, Griphook handles the sword without it returning to the Headmaster's office. And Snape takes it out of the Headmaster's office for a considerable period without it returning to the office.
