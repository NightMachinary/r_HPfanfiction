Well, in the case Harry didn't end up finding it, then it'd be safe anyway. The sword would be buried at the bottom of some forgotten pool in a forest. Not the best place to put the bloody sword of Gryffindor but not many people would think to look there. Honestly Snape probably thought Harry wouldn't be so stupid in his efforts to get the sword.

There were alternatives to jumping into a freezing lake with (from Harry's point of view, but we knew Ron was there) with nobody around to help him if he got into a spot of trouble. Seriously, if Ron hadn't been around Harry would've drowned or frozen to death. I also agree with the idea that you need to be brave to get the sword that literally symbolises courage.
