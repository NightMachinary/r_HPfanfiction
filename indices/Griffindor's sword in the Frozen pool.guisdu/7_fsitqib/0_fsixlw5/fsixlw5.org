I would say Snape was stupid in risking it by leaving it under the pool. He was leading Harry to the Griffindor's sword. If he could not lead Harry to it, he simply should retrieve it and try again. He would be stupid to leave the Sword in an unknown pool somewhere in the forest of Dean for no reason.
