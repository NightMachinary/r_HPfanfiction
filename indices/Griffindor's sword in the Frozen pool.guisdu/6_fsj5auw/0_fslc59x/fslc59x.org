Harry has the best claim to the sword until Neville pulls it out of the Hat. Griphook handles the sword without having taken it in an act of bravery. And, if it was the case that it need to taken in an act of bravery, then Dumbledore and Snape would not need to hide the sword from ministry or the death eaters. So, this theory doesn't make sense.

My thought is that the act of bravery is only needed to pull the sword out of the Hat. But once it is out, it remains until another person needs the sword, has the hat and acts in bravery.
