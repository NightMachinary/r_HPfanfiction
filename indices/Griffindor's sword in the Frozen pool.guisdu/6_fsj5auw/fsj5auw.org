Dumbledore said to Snape the sword had to be taken with an act of bravery. Dumbledore could pass it to Snape because Snape didn't want to use it (so the sword didn't need to acknowledge him like its master), Harry did. Also, they're both headmasters. The sword is a founder's magical item, it recognizes headmasters' authority (like Hogwarts accepted Snape as headmaster, the office let him inside and all, not like the Umbridge).
