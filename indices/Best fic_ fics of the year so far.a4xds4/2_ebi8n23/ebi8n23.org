The two medium length (50k words) fics by Starfox5 are great:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802): Squib!Petunia forms a great team with Sirius, Bill, and Fleur, and they find the secret to defeat Voldemort in dangerous, ancient Egyptian tombs.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Grindelwald broke out after Dumbledore's murder and tried to 'redeem' himself, but with lots of misunderstandings and seriously unexpected results.

Other nice fics started or completed this year:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]], linkffn(10937871): super!MadScientist!SocialJusticeWarrior!Harry

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088810/1/Carpe-Noctem][Carpe Noctem]], linkffn(13088810): Voldemort gets a second chance as Tom Riddle in 1943!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12775205/1/Final-Protocol][Final Protocol]], linkffn(12775205): Technically it's published on Dec 27 2017, but I would count it as a 2018 fic. It's a time travel involving Harry and Susan Bones, with a twist. I really like how Susan is portrayed here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes][Lady Archimedes]], linkffn(11463030): super!Hermione invents lots of spells and carries the war on her shoulder.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126): Finally done after 8 years of writing. It's a nice canon compliant fic that depicts Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009, from their Muggle neighbor's POV.
