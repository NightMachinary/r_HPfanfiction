I'd have to re-read it. But if the 'refiner's fire' happens in between (which if I remember correctly it does) Harry perceives his relationship with Casey as it happened "five years ago." Also she comforts him, which hastens their relationship.

It's is definitely approaching forced, but I think it stays this side of rushed.
