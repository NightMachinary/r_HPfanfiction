If you want actual reviews then promoting your story in circles where people are known for being aspiring literary critics is probably the best way.

If you just want the review count of the story to go up regardless of the quality of the reviews (or lack of it, as it is wont to be) then just posting the link everywhere that kids and teenagers congregate will work. Pardon me for potentially being rude, though, but that's kind of a ... hmm, sad thing, really; if you are writing good stuff then you should learn how to be proud of what you wrote regardless of how many kids shout “hurray” (though I do acknowledge that learning that can be difficult).
