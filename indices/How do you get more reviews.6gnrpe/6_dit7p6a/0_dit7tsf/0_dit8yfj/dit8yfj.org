Going to the critic circles it is, then. While I cannot vouch for them in any capacity as I am not a part of it and some people from it rub me in the wrong way, “Dark Lord Potter” (a forum) is one such circle or at least was one such circle so for a lack of other options you can go there. Just be aware that some of their people are outright brutal with criticism, sometimes to the point where outsiders think that they go too far, so if you do go there be aware not to take what they write personally. Another place is here, just promote your story once you have it up and ask for actual reviews and you should get some, I've seen it happen a few times so it's something that happens.
