I feel that there is a big potential to writing as you go in the form of overgrown quests. Of course, that requires much bigger commitment and thought that shipping poll.

The Matou Shinji series that I recommend here often is like that, and the unpredictability it brings is one of the main hooks for me. After all, if readers screw up Shinji may die, Harry may die, Voldemort may win. Nobody is safe, nothing is predetermined. Unfortunately, I don't know anything else like that.
