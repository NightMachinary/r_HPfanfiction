I can, though!

On SV, The First Law is a PMMM crossover with Sally-Anne Perks becoming a Puella Magi after a Dementor tries to kiss her Squib mother. /Highly/ recommended.

Also on SV, Tale of a Shattered Soul follows Riddle's horcrux starting from when Ginny writes in the Diary.

The Next Great Adventure follows an Artificer Harry that becomes a "solver of problems of various sorts" after Ginny dies during the final battle.

Peeking into SB, there's a new "Anti-Quest" that advertises itself as being about putting obstacles in the protagonist's path, On the Path to Greatness, but I've not read it yet.
