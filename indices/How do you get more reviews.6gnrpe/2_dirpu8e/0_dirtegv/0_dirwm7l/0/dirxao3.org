In the form of a quest it works, indeed. You can't really write it otherwise anyway (I mean, except if you're willing to plan out every possibility, which seems a colossal work, and you don't give the readers the opportunity to propose their own options).

The thing is, something you plan out well will always be better, you can notice and correct mistakes that otherwise would become apparent only chapters later, for instance. In the case of a quest, you sacrifice that for interactivity. It's not necessarily bad, it's just a different beast.

  Unfortunately, I don't know anything else like that.

You can find quests on spacebattles.com or sufficientvelocity.com if you care to register. I couldn't recommend any though, I'm not reading that stuff at the moment, and it's time sensitive if you want to participate.
