You could imply it but not really do it. Ask people questions like that: "Do you think Harry should abandon Ron and Hermione and go off on his own?" but you can either say later in the A/N: "A lot of people wanted Harry to stay with Ron and Hermione but apparently he had other ideas..." or "Just as you wished, Harry makes a little change on the company he keeps..."
