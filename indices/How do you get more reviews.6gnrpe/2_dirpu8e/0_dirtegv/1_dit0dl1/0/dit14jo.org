You should make it clear from the start, though. Maybe something like: "I don't know if I will follow the results of the poll, but I will take it into account" or such. Or explain that it's more of a discussion than actual participation in the story.

Actually, it is a good idea, people like to talk about the stories they like.

But if you want to make you story interactive, you should write a quest from the start. Hybrids don't work so well in my experience as a reader.
