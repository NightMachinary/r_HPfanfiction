Insofar as I've noted, these things have the greatest effects upon reviews:

1. Fandom. Fandoms that have more stories tend to get more reviews, as a general rule of thumb. I've found stories worthy of professional publication in obscure fandoms, but with only a handful of reviews. Conversely, many of the very popular fics (especially in anime fandoms) are trash.

2. Shipping/Pairing. Stories that have romance (and sex) in them tend to get a greater number of views/reviews. In particular, pairings that are rarely written but disproportionately popular (pairings such as Harry/Fleur, Harry/Daphne, Harry/Bellatrix) tend to get more reviews than a fic that is otherwise identical. People like to whine about or praise them in the comments.

3. Length. Longer fics tend to garner more reviews. Many people filter fics by length beginning at 40k+ words.

4. AGE. I CANNOT emphasize this one enough. Some of the fics you are comparing yours to may well be as much as ten years old, or older. In that time, they will have garnered an obscene number of reviews, if they are worth reading at all. It should also be noted that I've found people tend to be more stingy with reviews nowadays, probably because of the mobile app.

5. Start your fic out as a T fic, and then shift it up to M a good ways in, in order to maximize readerbase.

6. Over-powered Main Character. For reasons incomprehensible to me, this attracts more people than actually writing a fic well. Lord Potter ones are especially popular, though they are sneered at by any self-respecting reader.

Those are the main things that reliably influence reviews. Some stories have lots of reviews but low follows/favs because they have serial followers who review every single chapter.

IMHO, blurbs do not work well as a method of getting reviews. Authors who do so come across (to me, at least) as desperate, or as holding the fic ransom for reviews. There's nothing more likely to make me close the window and never look at the fic or author again.

Some authors do 'review polls', asking people what pairing or fights or characters they would like to see. That seems to work fairly well, but I am of the opinion that it infringes on Fanfiction.net's terms of publication for stories.
