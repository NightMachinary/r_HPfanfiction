I would say get more readers. I know it pains your soul, like every other writer, but people actually do search for Dark!Harry Evil!Harry format when looking for fics. Use whatever tags are remotely relevant, and slap em on. It also helps to get added to communities, but that is more a factor of having a good fic that is easy to find.
