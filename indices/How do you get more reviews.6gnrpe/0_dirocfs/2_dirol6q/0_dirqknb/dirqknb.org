There aren't enough characters available in the summary box (assuming this is on ffn) to waste any of them in saying, 'First story I've written so constructive criticism, please. Rated M for language and violence. Ideally HP/DG' Your summary is there to give the reader an indication of what they will find in the story and I'm afraid this doesn't.
