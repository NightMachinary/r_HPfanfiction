It rather shouldn't be necessary to include the information about ratings in the summary. If you must, to the author's notes it goes, but it's not really necessary unless it's specifically to assure your readers that none of the other possible things that could cause it to have that rating are there. Also, if you are writing a story with dark Harry it's not too difficult to do other things that the M rating is for, so that particular piece of information may stop being true as you continue writing unless you really know what you are doing.

On a random note, I congratulate you for the proper usage of an ellipsis; a great many people include a space after it but not before it, whereas the standards are either no spaces at all (what you have) or a space both before and after. And no, I am not being sarcastic here, it's quite refreshing to see the thing used properly actually.

And on another random note, when I scrolled up and read that the previous attempt at the summary had “HP/DG” in it, my first thought was “hmm, Harry Potter and ... Draco ... Granger?”, which shows that I need sleep but which you may also find funny
