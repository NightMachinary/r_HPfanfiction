With a dark Harry story, it is very easy to forget that you aimed for a lower rating and, getting lost in the heat of the moment, make a scene a bit too graphic. Any scenes of violence that are ... well, really, any kind of graphic at all, are already a reason to put the story into the M rating cupboard. While that isn't bad in itself, because there are a lot of delightful stories with the rating and as such only people new to it and those who just don't want to see graphic bits will avoid it so there isn't much of a reason to avoid it, when you want to aim for a lower rating---or, as it is in your case, for a situation where it is supposed to only be given that rating for a single other reason---it can potentially be a nightmare.
