Step one is to realise that people only really review for two reasons:

1. If there's something they're itching to say.

2. To ask you to update.

A long list of "update please!" is boring so let's say you're asking about how to increase substantive reviews.

The main reason for someone to have something to say is if they want to share their opinion. So, what kinds of opinions do people want to share in reviews?

- Advocacy for a pairing.

- Disagreement with your interpretation of canon.

- Disagreement over something a character has done or said.

- Disagreement with something you wrote in an author's note.

So, if you want to maximise reviews:

- Make the pairing of your story ambiguous and tease multiple possible pairings.

- Use your story to elaborate upon canon in specific ways e.g. by including some magical theory.

- Include interesting and controversial themes in your story for the characters to discuss/act upon e.g. moral dilemmas, political disagreements, issues of discrimination and justice, etc.

- Write controversial author's notes.

All of this is subject to a relatively obvious caveat: people can only review these things if they have read your fic to begin with. So either write well or write popular tropes.
