Yeah I know what happens in CoS, what I am trying to determine is what would have happened had it succeeded (particularly in regards to the Main Sould Fragment), as well as whether it was fulfilling it's purpose or was going rogue. Would Original Voldemort potentially had to deal with one of his Horcruxes going around declaring itself to be Voldemort?

Now you say the Horcruxes seem to work in the interests of the original. But do they really? I mean Nagini is a living thing with a will of it's own, and it seems that being a Horcrux gives Voldemort additional control over her, so with her yes, she works in Voldemort's interests. But I don't think we have enough evidence to declare that the object Horcruxes work for the original (other than the obvious, keeping the original sould bound to earth). I mean, unless the Diary soul meant to join up with the Original Soul, it seems to me it was going rogue, and acting on its own.
