It wouldn't have any effect on the main soul, that existed as a wraith because Lily's protection destroyed it's body. The Horcruxes don't restore Voldemort's body or anything, they prevent his soul from moving to the afterlife.

The Diary would simply have a physical body of its own to work with. Just red CoS, Diary Riddle could pick up wands and such like any other wizard. Horcruxes do seem to work in the interests for the original (same person, not surprising). I'm writing a story where I'll explore that dynamic between the Horcrux with a physical body and its progenitor as they work in tandem to bring about Voldemort's goals.
