Ok so it would have simply reverted to being the Diary once it restores the original soul to a body, or re-merge with the original soul? Cause otherwise, yes there would be multiple Voldemort's running around. I mean you can say "There can only be one" all you want, and technically the main soul fragment is the true/original Voldemort, but the Diary soul would still be like a clone that has all the memories and abilities that Voldemort had when he made the Diary Horcrux, with all the same capabilities to become just like the original.
