Nothing. The main soul fragment is still the true Voldemort. Most likely, it would have made every effort once reanimating to locate the original soul (in Albania) and work to restore his body. It may even be plausible that Voldemort can reabsorb a soul fragment that has left its container, though that is simply speculation.

But it wouldn't become a "Second Voldemort." There can be only one after all (heh heh).
