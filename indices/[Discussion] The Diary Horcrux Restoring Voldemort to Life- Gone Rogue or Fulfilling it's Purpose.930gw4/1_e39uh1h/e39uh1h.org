No, it wouldn't have summoned Voldemort! it doesn't work like that. They're separate entities! They're not quicksaves, they're not reloads, they don't get used up!

The Diary Tom Riddle was its own consciousness, its own soul, what little piece it had to call that for itself. Maybe it would have had some kind of mental connection to Voldemort, like Harry and Nagini have with him because of hosting soul pieces, but that's it. They wouldn't merge, they wouldn't do anything like that.

Who knows what his actual goals and motives would have been after getting a body, though. Maybe he would have allied with Voldemort, or struck off on his own.
