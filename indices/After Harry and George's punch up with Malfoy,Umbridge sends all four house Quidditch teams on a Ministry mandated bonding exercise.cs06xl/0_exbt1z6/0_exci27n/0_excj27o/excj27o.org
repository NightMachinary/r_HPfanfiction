Aurors start questioning the students:

"Do you know what happened?"

"I don't know, she just up and died"

"Any suspicions on who it could be?"

"Nope"

"How did she die?"

"She definetly didn't drink an intraceable poison that disappears once she's dead in her evening tea."

The Auror looks at the student very intensely.

"Okay", all smiley faces
