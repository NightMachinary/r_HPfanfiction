Harry and co. entered the room. It looked like a war meeting. Each corner was for each house. To their right we're the Hufflepuffs. To their left the Slytherins. To the left of the Slytherins were the Ravenclaws. And in the middle was a tiny desk with four chairs at each side. There sat Malfoy, Cedric and a Ravenclaw named Kate representing their respective houses. Ron pushed him to the middle table while the rest of the Gryffindors took over the last corner between the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. Once he sat down, Cedric folded his arms in front of his face and said: „Let's plot the murder of Umbridge.“
