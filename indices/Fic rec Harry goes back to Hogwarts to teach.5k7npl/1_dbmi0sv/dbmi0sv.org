“he will have the power the dark lord knows not” (linkfo3(5579962)) features this, though it is not exactly explored.

“The Untitled Cheekquel Project” (linkffn(2477165)) and “You Did What!” (linkffn(2630300)), respectively the sequel and the sequel's sequel to “Where in the World is Harry Potter?” (linkffn(2354771)) have that as a somewhat noteworthy feature.

Also “Seventh Horcrux” (linkffn(10677106)), though it's not the main focus either.
