[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/786310][Slytherin's Warning]] is a great fic about a post 6th year Draco choosing not become a death eater and subsequently getting trapped in a house with Remus Lupin. No slash. Very in character for both Draco and Lupin. It's a slow burn fic and the ending isn't a cakes and rainbows, but I think you would like it.

EDIT: Also, the fic is finished, but for some reason the author didn't post all of it on Ao3. The full fic is on fanfic.net.
