I'd charm a coffee cup like that. Every time I go down and forget what I had planned to do, I end up making myself a coffee. Once I grabbed the cup, I remember.

Its a great idea. I hope you find a nice way to implement it somewhere.

edit: As that just happened again, my theory is now that my coffee cup /is/ in fact, charmed to remind me of my tasks on the first floor. Fascinating...
