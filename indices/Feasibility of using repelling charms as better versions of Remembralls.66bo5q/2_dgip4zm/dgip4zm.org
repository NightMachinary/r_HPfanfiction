Hmmm, could you trap someone in a corridor or stairwell, by placing one-way-triggered such charms at either end, causing the victim to endlessly go from one end to other until they collapse out of exhaustion, starvation, or thirst, eventually perishing, unable to remember long enough to save themselves?

Why is this not a common assassination method? Once the charms are lifted, it looks like a 'normal' death...
