I can't remember the name. What I remember though, is that Draco had become the potions teacher and Harry had disappeared from Magical Britain. Draco meets him 10 years later and invites him to Hogwarts. Harry is then very powerful as he had been traveling, amassing knowledge and power. Draco invites him primarily because of a terrorist organization - this time made up of muggleborns disenchanted of the government that want to finish off purebloods, as they are the "root of all evil in magical society." And Harry is something akin an icon to them.
