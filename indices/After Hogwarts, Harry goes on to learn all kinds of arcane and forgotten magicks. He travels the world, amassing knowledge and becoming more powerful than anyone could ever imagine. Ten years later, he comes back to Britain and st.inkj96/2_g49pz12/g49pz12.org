linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12373699/1/TSSD-Prequel-A-new-world-A-new-chance]]) matches the first part of (fem) Harry traveling around the world learning all kinds of magic. She doesn't come back to Britain, though, but transports herself to the Elemental Nations (Naruto).

Treads the fine line between playing tropes straight and subverting them, like Harry has all the Lordships - but doesn't touch politics, simply reads books from their libraries.
