I did read one where, Harry, does just that, although I don't know whether it was for ten years or not.

The knowledge isn't so much ancient though as it is just culturally different and focused on the different mediums practiced by different countries.

The story also quickly crosses over into Game Of Thrones/A Song Of Ice And Fire. So fair warning it doesn't stick to the wizarding world for long.

I don't know if you can find it on other sites but I found this on FF.net.
