Sure, that's fair. Here is what I have posted in the past:

------------ Hello! I'm writing a fic based on a premise I shared on this forum almost a year ago: [[/r/HPfanfiction/comments/60p0ar/comment/df89glb]]

I've had a plot bunny for nearly a year. The plot is based on what would have happened if Harry never entered the wizarding world. Dumbledore prevented it because he believed that Voldemort wouldn't have returned if Harry didn't go to Hogwarts. Instead, Harry becomes an apprentice of sort to Dumbledore. Harry grows up primarily living as a muggle with some magical training but he is never aware that an entire magical world exists. Dumbledore dies and Death Eater attacks begin to resurge. The Order of the Phoenix reassembles and Harry is found when he's about 20. There is also a romance side-plot.

Harry of course feels betrayed by Dumbledore, who kept him from his heritage. He has difficulty coping with the betrayal of the grandfather-like figure of his difficult childhood with the Dursley family. -------------------

Hopefully this is enough information, my apologies for not including it earlier.
