  turning birds into goblets may not seem massively useful
#+end_quote

The turning birds into goblets thing is incremental. Taure has done a writeup and I can't recall it very well, but essentially, everything they learn in school leads them to learn more advanced forms of magic later on. Simple charms in third year lead into more advanced stuff in fourth and fifth year. Simpler transfiguration in the first five years lead into advanced transfiguration in the latter two years.

As for few people /needing/ to know to calculate the volume of a cone, you're being rather short-sighted. The purpose of learning that isn't to memorise random formulae (as is the case with most things in basic mathematics), but just to test your arithmetic and multiplicative abilities. The formula is just there as something to improve your memory.
