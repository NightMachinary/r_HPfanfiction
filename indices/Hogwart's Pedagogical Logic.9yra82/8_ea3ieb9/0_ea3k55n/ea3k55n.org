I am aware of that, however, I felt that it might be a point someone might pick up on so I wanted to address it early on.

I am not really being short-sighted as I don't agree with that particular pedagogical theory, it's illogical and presumes that people will have their tasks set for them before they reach an age at which they can decide for themselves. It's one which is spouted quite frequently though, so in this case I'm asking whether it is possible that the wizards and witches have gone down that road, illogical as it may be.
