Neither. I was referring to my original point which is that wizards may have chosen a mode of education founded on only teaching the skills perceived as necessary. I disagree with the principal as I regard it as too restrictive and logically inconsistent as it assumes that a child's desires and interests will not change or grow if you introduce them to a wider range of possibilities. The road I am refering to is the pedagogical school of thought which limits what you do to only those skills which are deemed to have an immediate use.

Though that isn't to say our current form of education couldn't do with a radical overhaul which moves away from the rote memorisation of the nineteenth century.
