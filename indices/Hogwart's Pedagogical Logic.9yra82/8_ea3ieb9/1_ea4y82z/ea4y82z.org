Honestly, I would have been more than happy to stop at algebra and move on with my life. It's extremely useful to know how to figure out x when given the rest of the info, but frankly struggling for the C in calculus was a goddamned waste of my time and energy that I could have been wasting on increasingly more specific forms of microbiology.
