It wasn't till high school that PE felt like a good use of time. Until that point, the teacher would basically have everyone run a few laps, then throw out some balls of various types. If you didn't want to play the sports, you could walk or run on the track. So basically, I'd be walking circles slowly, and chatting to my friends. The second that bell rang, I'd be the hell out of there as fast as I could. I fucking haaaaated it.

Then came the high school PE. 1st 2 semesters were theory. You learned about how the muscles worked, why they get sore, the sorts of foods to be seeking out, and general knowledge on keeping healthy. Second half was the practise. The teacher would introduce one new thing every week, and asked that everyone try it out. First week was swimming. Those who didn't know how were welcome to learn, or walk the shallow end.

Also, the first 10 minutes was warm ups with stretches and junk so that the muscles are nice and ready for action. Last 10 minutes were cool down stretches.

He took us into the weight room and had us all try various weights, and showed us proper technique for building muscle. It wasn't my bag, but it was still highly interesting to learn about. What I liked is that he never tried to shame someone for being out of shape, or not knowing how to do something. Even though I don't necessarily use all the things I learned (I'm not a fan of weights, and I don't think I'll ever be), I still know how if ever I want to.

He was a very good teacher and I still think of him fondly.
