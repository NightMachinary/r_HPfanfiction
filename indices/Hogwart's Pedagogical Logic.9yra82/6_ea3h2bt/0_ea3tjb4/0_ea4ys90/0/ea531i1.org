Which is wonderful for all of you. I'm physically disabled and the things they require me to do are things that are either impossible or extremely physically dangerous to me. I support a healthy lifestyle, remember the want to be a doctor part, I know exercise is important, but penalizing a student for disability is not acceptable, and t that's what's going on in my case. And yes I've filled grievances and lawyers around here all refuse to sue their alma mater.
