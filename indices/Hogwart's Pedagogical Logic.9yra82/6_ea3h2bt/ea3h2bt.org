As someone who has never had to know how to calculate the area of a cone but has wished a million times I could scorgify the pet cages clean or take them with me on trips by transfiguring them into something like a pillow that could easily go in my luggage, I think this is very valid.

I think that all the basic year one and two classes have everyday use or are good to know about (history of music sounds useless until you get ready to argue with a goblin, and given how many witches and wizards prefer to fly places, knowing astronomy can be really useful in not getting lost). Third year electives are to help students find things that interest them so that they can get jobs later that they enjoy, and they can drop the subjects that aren't relevant at all to their chosen careers in their final two years.

I wish the USA had similar education as je been engaged in an argument for several years over how my physical inability to do things like push ups and play ultimate frisbee are highly unlikely to come up in fields of being a doctor, doing medical research, or writing (unless I'm writing a very detailed scene on ultimate frisbee or doing push ups)
