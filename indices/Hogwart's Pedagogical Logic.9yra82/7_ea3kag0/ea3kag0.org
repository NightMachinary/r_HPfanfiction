Indeed, wizards and witches are fine with learning and even inventing specific spells and potions, but they don't seem all that interested in delving into the underlying principles, do they? They don't, for example, devise a standardised unit of magical power, or probe the underlying mechanism that enables wizards (and not muggles) to access magic, or mathematically describe the precise nature of each spell. Not in canon, anyway; there are some interesting explorations, eg linkffn(The Arithmancer).

This idea fits rather neatly with linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality), which has a protagonist who does want to discover the fundamental laws. Though he finds it vastly more difficult, not to mention dangerous, than he initially expected.
