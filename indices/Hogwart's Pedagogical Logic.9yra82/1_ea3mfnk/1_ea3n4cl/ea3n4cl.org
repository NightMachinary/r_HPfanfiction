I do agree with you, please don't misunderstand this post. I'm not saying that the idea is right, I'm merely suggesting an alternative reading for the problems we naturally see in the education provided at Hogwart's. Particularly addressing the lack of certain classes we tend to argue are essential.

You're right that the limits of the narrative drive us towards seeing the classes through a lens of foreshadowing which naturally creates the impression that the classes are practically orientated for a wizard or witch's survival. You're probably right that the lack of those classes does indicate that they are working within a curriculum based on principals of providing people the fundamental tools. Though certain things, such as the Household Charms are covered in other areas.

Perhaps I should revise my original suggestion and instead propose that they educate to a rather antique model of what is needed which privileges survival (they have a major class practically dedicated to self-defence after all).
