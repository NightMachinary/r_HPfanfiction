I could make a very long winded argument about why education must go beyond everday skills, but that would neither fit the subreddit nor my time schedule. I'll just say that this notion that education is purely there to make you as efficient and productive as possible has led to a deterioration of many values we as (western) nations claim to be built on.

I don't think that the wizarding world chose to do that. But I will say that the probability of a spell being useful to you in some way is higher than the probability that a mathematical formula is.

The problem with this argument as a whole is that we barely read about any lessons. Most of what we see in lessons is used later in the series and/or has some impact on the story. I would think that Hogwarts teaches a similarly broad set of knowledge and skills as our schools do, but we only ever see what is useful to Harry (and Harry specifically). Plus, the absence of Household Charms, Wizarding Studies (Ministry Bureaucracy, Gringotts banking,... for example) and other useful classes lead me further to believe that Hogwarts is educating on a broader and academical spectrum.
