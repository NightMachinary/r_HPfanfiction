What we saw in the books is probably just the tip of the iceberg - if someone were to read my thoughts, they would not pick up on my vague understanding of how electric current works or how my water usage is billed. Similarly, we only get what is directly relevant to whatever shenanigans Harry and co. are involved in, not any of the background that makes the magical world come to life. There is a reason why the Hobbit and LOTR are only four books with 11 (?) others acting as filler and background information for Middle Earth - it takes a lot of writing to even begin to explain how a society works.
