Yeah, the problem with the education system (at least in the UK) is that its origins lie in the industrial revolution. They didn't want to educate the masses to help them, they educated them to be better workers in the factories. This philosophy of education for the sake of employment, as opposed to being better individuals is still ingrained in the modern system.

Ever been discouraged from becoming an artist, dancer, writer (as in my case) by a teacher telling you "You won't make any money." ? That's because of the aforementioned.

I read this in an article a few years ago, which I can't find anymore. It was a psychologist talking about their experiences with a child who wanted to become a dancer. Their parent had brought the child in because they couldn't sit still, the psychologist asked the parent to leave, flipped on the radio and watched the girl jump up and start dancing. They told them to get her enrolled in dance lessons as she was a born dancer. They then went on to talk about what I've discussed here and how hard it can be for those kids that don't conform to the future of a 9 to 5 desk job.

Of course when I read to my husband about this thread, he brought up how young children are when they go to Hogwarts, leaving them with only a middle school level of reading and math.
