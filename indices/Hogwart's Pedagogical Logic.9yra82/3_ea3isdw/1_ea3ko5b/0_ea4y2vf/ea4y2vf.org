They are getting higher levels of reading. They have to read fairly complex books in theory of the magic before actually doing it. They write essays all the time. They get math for sure. Potions is all calculating ratios. Astronomy would also include theory about light, the various planets, the stars, etc. Even in the Middle Ages, we had a pretty good understanding of space. It wasn't perfect, but there was plenty of good information. That's physics right there. Which more or less depends on calculus.

They have classes in runes. So not only are they regularly doing readings in English, but also a different language and writing system. Divination, especially when using star charts and the like, is fairly heavily reliant on pretty good math skills. I'm under the assumption that those sections are not “look up online what your horroscope is” but rather, “here's how all the houses are set up. Derive from your own info what the rest is.”

I kind of take issue with the idea that education needs to be math class, science class, reading class. By the time you're in middle school, I feel like it would make more sense to have a more integrated curriculum, which borrows heavily across the aisle to get the job done.

The best school I've attended have been like that. Yes, they had the discrete subjects, but they borrowed from other subjects regularly, and encouraged us to draw our own connections. English class had at least two major projects (one for poetry, one for prose) where we had to get together in groups of 2 - 4, and perform. The poetry one, we had to record a video. The prose one we had to reinterpret a play and move it to a different setting.

In Drama class, the teacher emphasised dramaturge work. Basically it's all the research that you do before a play, so that you know what you're on about. It involved multiple trips to the school library to check the reference books, websites, and whatever else we could find about the plays we studied.

In English class, we had to write a persuasive argument using any scientific concept we wanted, as long as we had primary sources to back it up. In marine biology, the teacher encouraged us to use whatever methods we could to process the information. My friends and I did an interpretive dance about the water cycle, so that the different states of water could make sense on a molecular level.

That's why I get a bit miffed when people say that the wizarding world is turning out people with a 5th grade education. They may not be calling it by our names, but they're certainly doing plenty of learning. In my head cannon, it's all integrated.
