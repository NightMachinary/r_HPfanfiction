Very, very true, the program of rote learning has never been removed from the UK education system, to its detriment. At the same time people end up in that weird hinterland where they can't see the practical uses of their skills.

Absolutely, primary level education for reading and maths, but then again one might ask whether the wizards would see a great number of advantages in those fields anyway. Reading and its ilk might well (given their history) still be connected to the clergy and the grammar, rhetoric, and logic of the medieval universities, emphasising those skills and their pursuit beyond a basic level would put them into the awkward position of interacting with the social memory of muggles who they remember as persecutors. Not to mention, amongst those real people who argue against the modern school system's lack of applicability for jobs maths is often brought up (somewhat incorrectly) as a particularly significant problem.
