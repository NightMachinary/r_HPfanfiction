My school became a sports college. We had PE everyday and near the end of school when I was in 'Fuck it' mode, I purposelessly lost my PE kit and just read or drew whilst all the hyperactive kids ran around screaming.

My husband had it even worse at his school with peer pressure revolving around PE. At his school you HAD to like a football team. And I mean you HAD to. If anyone asked and you said you didn't like football, everyone would turn against you. He like me, preferred to sit and read in the corner and had to constantly try and not get his book stolen. He even had a former student turned teacher run up behind him and try to kick him in the back of the ankles to get him to run faster. Yeah. Also worth noting my husband is Asthmatic.

Size isn't a good thing for me because of Autism and social agoraphobia. My school was was very overcrowded and to this day walking in crowds send me into a rage.

I'm into the arts and we only got one lesson of art a week. Just one. And the art course wasn't very integrating either, I like Anime and Manga and so didn't take it for fear I'd be bullied into realism. I'm self taught and while I get A LOT of flack for being a self taught Anime artist who doesn't like studying nudes (they give me anxiety), I feel much more of a sense of accomplishment.

What would have been a good thing for me to learn would have been animal husbandry. I currently have 5 rescue Pigeons and a Seagull and am in training as a dog groomer.
