As someone who does want a desk job, the education system didn't really help me much either. I think it's more accurate to say that the education system is suffering from being too general, with even good sized schools (mine had near 1000 students) not being able to provide a good selection of optional courses or much in the way of hands-on experience. I mean, I had to take an art class where I learned color theory (why?) and a physical education class where I stayed in the background while the more athletic kids threw dodgeballs at each other - I realize physical activity is important, but a yoga class option would have been a lot more beneficial to a non-athlete. On the other hand, there was nothing about managing personal finance or the need to network.
