Here's my take on American magical schooling, based more on my own musings than anything else.

Firstly, there's more than one school in the US. If you figure that 1/4 of 1% of the population in the UK is in someway capable of magic, that'd still be the rather high figure of 152500 souls. If you use that same figure for the US, it's 797500, almost a million people. Even if you eliminate a chunk as non-school age, that's a LOT of wizarding going on.

So, my theory is, there's probably a solid dozen or so schools, but my take is that it's differentiated between lower and higher learning. Hogwarts is a boarding school that covers pretty much the entirety of a person's education, middle school through college, focused like a vocational degree. I'm guessing there's hundreds of what amount to High Schools across the US, where an American Magician can get the basics of their education, and choose to attend one of the bigger schools as post-secondary, where the schools focus on specific programs.

Second, It appears as though Hogwarts sort of encouraged the students towards a 'Hyper focus' of sorts. (I want to be an Auror, I NEED these classes. In turn, these classes pretty much teach the same thing over and over for rote mastery) and in counter, I feel like American schools teach a greater breadth of things at the cost of depth.

In simple, a British student's Expelliarmus is probably better than an American's, but that American probably has a dozen more spells in their bag that the British student has never seen, or experienced.

Third, I believe that American schools probably have a considerably larger curriculum devoted to muggle studies (Science, Math, etc) as a way to further their studies in an all-encompassing way. Wizard world jobs can't be hiring that aggressively after all.

Fourth, the amount of Half blood and Muggle blood students is probably considerably higher, based on immigration and the like. The 1920's probably saw a massive influx of magically blooded people.

Fifth, instead of a Ministry of Magic, we most likely have a Department of (something magical, I think Thaumaturgy has a ring to it) headed by a Secretary thereof.

Sixth, If I were going to place the college level schools, I'd put them in these places...

Salem Massachusetts

Georgetown Maryland

Stone Mountain Georgia

Baton Rouge Louisiana

Houston Texas

Chandler Arizona

Santa Catalina Island California

Eureka California

Eugene Oregon

Burlington Washington

Aurora Illinois

Lebanon Kansas (Center of the US)

Placing them near, but not in, large population centers would make the most sense, and hugging the coast seems a very Manifest Destiny thing to do. (I'm American, I can say that, LOL)

So, that's my take. Opinions?
