From the point of view of someone who spends more time DMing than reading Pottermore... Assuming you're looking or willing to create it from whole cloth, there are a lot of other important questions bundled up with that.

How was Magical America settled? Muggleborns may have made the trip with their parents not knowing they were magical. Squibs may have fled to the colonies to start over as far from the families that found them to be embarrassing as possible. Did those settlers carry a grudge against the old British purebloods that shaped their society?

Or, given that the colonization of America only just barely predates the statute of secrecy, but the Declaration of Independence /doesn't/ it's possible that Magical and Muggle society look nothing alike and American wizards and witches are all still British citizens and send their kids to Hogwarts. Or did they instead get folded into the already thriving Native American magical cultures? Is Magical America even a cohesive country? or does it's political map still look like the colonies did at the signing of the statute? with France and Spain and the Natives each holding onto pieces of it?

Sorry for the rather rambling response, but that's what my mind immediately spewed forth upon reading your question. Also... Salem, Ma. But only /AFTER/ the witch trials, because it amused the founders of the school to thumb their noses at the silly muggles. Or maybe the trials were sparked by a prank gone wrong by a group like the twins back in the day. Or perhaps a prank gone right?
