I always thought that would make a good plot bunny.

But otherwise, I'd like to think that there's a franchise system - almost like Macdonalds - so you've got a privately-funded organisation of tutors spread across the continent.

Maybe an 'old' boarding school or two for the prodigies and trust fund babies, and apprenticeships run predominantly by Native wizards and witches.
