It's My Life by Fyreheart has a school located in the Midwest, Stillwater, Minnesota to be exact, which is a real town founded in 1837 as a logging town by settlers. Minnesota had a fair number of indian tribes at that time and was largely settled by Norwegian, Finnish, Swedish and German immigrants. The Midwest in general is a good choice for placement for two reasons:

First the large amount of European settlers who were mainly lower, working class (maybe including disenfranchised muggleborns, 2nd or 3rd sons with no chance of an inheritance, squibs, etc as you suggested).

Second the East Coast was rapidly populated, but the Midwest was very sparsely inhabited, with small clusters of settlers of one ethnicity. Today there are many huge areas of wilderness and forest across the Midwest where it would be easy for a wizard school/society to reside, similar to Hogwarts' placement in Scotland.
