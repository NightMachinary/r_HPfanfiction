There are two segments of magical society in America: the United States, which has its capital in Philadelphia and its school in Salem; and Lecv Ekvnlike, which is centered in Oklahoma. (Sort of.) In domestic affairs, Lecv Ekvnlike is by far the superior. However, Lecv Ekvnlike is fiercely isolationist, so the US has appreciably more renown.

Lecv Ekvnlike is the result of a federation between the Choctaw, Cherokee, Muscogee, and Chickasaw, formed in reaction to European invaders. The Muscogee spearheaded the federation. It proved ineffectual at first; they could barely check the oncoming plagues, and the alliance was too sparse and had too much territory to cover, so in terms of defense, it was a failure. But there was one way it could, and did, succeed. Evacuation.

Take a plot of land thirty miles in radius. Copy it in another dimension. Hide the doorway. This is how Lecv Ekvnlike started. It's an enclosed ecosystem -- no sun, no water cycle, nothing. At least the edge is solid rather than, say, nothingness that you can fall off into, or a field that destroys anything that passes into it, or...

They had to create a world from nothing. And they made it happen. Over the next few years, they stuffed a couple thousand people into it. And then they kept going. They set up permanent air-freshening enchantments. They created a river with conjured water and created a sink that vanished it where it would have left the enclosure. They planted crops, built houses, moved fish into their river, created a false sun, set up a whole town. Eventually they expanded the area.

This was quite magic-intensive, so they constantly searched for people with the talent. At first they had an informal apprenticeship program. They drew children from leagues away. Eventually, as Europeans fought their way west, they expanded their search, rescuing people but prioritizing those who would be useful. At first this included a wide variety of professions and skills, but as time went on, they restricted their search to what could easily be identified: magical ability.

During this period, European American magic was dominated by hedge wizardry. Homeschooling, spotty education, and very limited knowledge of local magical flora and fauna. But the settlers did maintain contact with each other, and they joined in the Manifest Destiny ideals. They moved west -- and by sheer luck, they stumbled on Lecv Ekvnlike. The resulting skirmish was a decisive victory for Lecv Ekvnlike, and they drove the settlers back over the Appalachians.

Lecv Ekvnlike only grew from there. They established themselves as the sole owners of magic in most of the Americas, inducting everyone with the ability into their society or binding their magic. They've grown to nearly a hundred thousand people (the majority of which are at least passive mages, what the British call "squibs") and their world encompasses hundreds of square miles. They are preeminent enchanters and are adept at conjuration and space alteration.

--------------

Lecv Ekvnlike is pronounced "lichuh ikunleki" (/lɪtʃə ɪkənlɛkɪ/ in the International Phonetic Alphabet) and is Mvskoke (Creek) for "under the mound". Mvskoke is the primary language, the language of instruction, and the language of government, though most people are bilingual speakers of English.

Schooling in Lecv Ekvnlike started as an extension of the apprenticeship system. If you have a skill, you are expected to spend some of your time teaching. If you wish to learn a skill, you are expected to find someone who is close enough to your skill level that you're not wasting their time. The greatest enchanter of the land won't teach a ten-year-old, but she does teach people some of the time. However, in recent years, some people have devoted more of their time to teaching than to production. They are still viewed as valuable members of society.

There is a dedicated school area along with student housing. Advanced instruction typically happens in the teacher's workshop, but for basic instruction, teachers go to the students in classrooms warded to absorb stray spells. The school is near the hospital zone, a fact that has proved useful all too often. The classrooms are typically one to a building with plenty of grass and greenery between.

The topics of instruction include anything anyone thinks is useful, but a normal education, on the magical side, will have a student learn basic charms, transfiguration, and transportation. History and civic studies are mandatory. If you do not complete a course on contemporary non-magical society, you are not allowed to leave Lecv Ekvnlike unattended, so most people take that course. A typical student will spend a few months at each of a variety of jobs and eventually pursue one or two of them. Often they will engage in an extended apprenticeship with one of their teachers.

A graduate is expected to be able to expand a plot of land from a postage stamp to what they need to live on, design and build their house, butcher a hog, raise a kneazle, mend a broken bone, solve equations, till and fertilize a field, prepare a meal, debate law, and write a book. Specialization is for Europeans.
