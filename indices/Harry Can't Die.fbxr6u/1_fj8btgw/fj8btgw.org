Harry is also frustrated and tired of his undying in linkffn(8149841)^{Again and Again}, though there every time he dies, he wakes up on his very first birthday. He's very old and tired of life. Somewhat similar is linkao3(1113651)^{Sisyphus}, but there he wakes up on his 11th birthday and the universe really doesn't like it when he tries to alter things.

There are fics where it's stated that he won't die unless he wishes so. In linkao3(The Darkening of Your Soul) it's even done - during Quidditch Harry's skull is cracked (even his brain could be seen) but he doesn't die and wakes up a week later completely fine.

I heard that in linkao3(The Master of Death by Quine) Death is personified and revives Harry if he dies.
