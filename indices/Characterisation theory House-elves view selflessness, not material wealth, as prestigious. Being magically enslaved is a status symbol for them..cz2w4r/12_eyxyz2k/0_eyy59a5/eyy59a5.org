True enough, the notion I'm going with here though is that house-elves following this culture willingly embrace magical bondage as a kind of statement.\\
They don't have to be enslaved in order to work, so trading in their personal freedom for essentially zero gain is a way of saying 'look at how committed I am to making the lives of others better'.
