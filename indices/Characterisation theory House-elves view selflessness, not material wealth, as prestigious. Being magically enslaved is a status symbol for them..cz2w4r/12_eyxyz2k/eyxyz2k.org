Prestige based on "how much can you give away" rather than "how much do you have" is a thing. Consider how a host can show off to the guests by the lavishness of their meal and service.

However, I don't think it can be properly applied to the compulsory nature of house elf bonds. Surely, the most selfless act of all, and therefore most prestigious in this system, would be to provide a family with all the same services while /not/ being magically compelled to do so.
