People can turn *weird* shit into status symbols. Even things that are unequivocally not pleasant for them, or even actively harming them.

There's also the part where house elves are not human. They may not always think or behave in the same way humans do, and humans aren't always going to understand why that is or how they got to that point.

If a *wizard* interprets the relationship as “my house elf is happy to be a slave”, and the *house elf* interprets it as “I'm responsible for a whole tribe of weird hairless monkey pets, I have to look after them now”...who's right?

Your cat would think you were his slave, and happy to be so. You feed him, you clean up after him, you make a fuss of him when he complains. He scratches you or bites you occasionally, and yet you keep coming back. You'll even show off the worst injuries he gives you, or the biggest bills he racks up, as though they're impressive.

There's a lot your cat doesn't understand about how you work or why you do what you do. He'd also never think to ask about it, but just accept it as his due. Wizards are ignorant and self-centred enough that they miss (or see but don't bother to question) a lot about house elves...so what did they miss?
