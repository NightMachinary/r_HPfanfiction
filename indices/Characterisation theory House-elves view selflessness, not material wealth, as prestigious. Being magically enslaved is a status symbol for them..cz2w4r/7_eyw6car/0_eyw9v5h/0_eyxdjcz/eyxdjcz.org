  There's also the part where house elves are not human. They may not always think or behave in the same way humans do, and humans aren't always going to understand why that is or how they got to that point.

That's something to think about. Different species have different standards and probably an entire history to go with it, too bad people are bad at researching in the HP world.( and irl too) Also I might have something to do with the species instincts within its self. Think of Aragog for example, he's seems sentient and he probably is. But at the end of the day he's still a giant fucking spider. He told Harry and Ron first hand(leg?) that he would not let his young eat Hagrid(he raised him and probably but imprinted at some level) but when children (read: food) walk right up to them he will not deny them.
