  The issue with House Elves is that any kind of slavery cannot be consented to because a slave gains no benefits out of it but loses the right to opt-out. If House Elves were servants protected by labour rights, it would be no issue, but *canonically they are nothing but brainwashed slaves*.

I'm sorry, but I don't seem to remember hearing that house elves are brainwashed anywhere in the seven canon books. I know the Hogwarts elves, Winky and literally every house elf not named Dobby appear to be Uncle Toms, but we are looking at a separate species of sapient living beings, not humans. I like Rowling, but we seriously do not know enough about house elves, their internal thoughts and their culture to make any kind of assumption about their species without sloppily using our own species to form preconceived notions.
