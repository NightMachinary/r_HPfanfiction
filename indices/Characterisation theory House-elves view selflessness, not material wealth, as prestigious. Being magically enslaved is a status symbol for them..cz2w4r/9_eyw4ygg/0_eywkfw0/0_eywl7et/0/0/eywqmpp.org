So far I haven't seen a fic that properly makes house elves employees rather than slaves. To have a relationship that's not slavery or indentured servitude, it's not enough that house elves receive some form of pay (sustenance). They also need to be able to leave their master and find a new one. Ideally, they should be protected from abuse, and have equal rights to the extent possible.

Clearly, the house elf bond in HP doesn't allow the elf to break it end enforces absolute servitude. So there needs to be some legal mechanism to give them freedoms - i.e. their master is obliged to give them clothes if they request, and a somewhat effective enforcement mechanism. Ideally, active effort in society to develop a less restrictive version of the bond that still allows them to feed.

Finally, I'd argue house elves should receive more than just sustenance for the service they provide (unless their sustenance is actually burdensome for wizards, but that's never the case in fics). To compare, if a live-in maid is only paid with room and board, that'd be heavy exploitation if not outright slavery.

All in all, in a world where you need to be magically bound to servitude to survive, a society that doesn't approve of slavery should take steps to mitigate that. In none of the fics I've read such steps are shown.
