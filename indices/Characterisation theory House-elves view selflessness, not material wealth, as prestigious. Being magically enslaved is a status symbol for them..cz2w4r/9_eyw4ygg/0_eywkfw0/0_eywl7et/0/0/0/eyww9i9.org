  Clearly, the house elf bond in HP doesn't allow the elf to break it end enforces absolute servitude. So there needs to be some legal mechanism to give them freedoms - i.e. their master is obliged to give them clothes if they request, and a somewhat effective enforcement mechanism. Ideally, active effort in society to develop a less restrictive version of the bond that still allows them to feed.

This point really cuts to the heart of the issue. What trouble would there be if a house elf wanted to leave terrible wizards like the Malloy's? Legally and magically requiring the option to separate and find new options like other wizards or places like Hogwarts is ideal in this situation, as it provides a sapient species at least some degree of free will. Further points about working around the need for house elves to be tied down to wizards and some governing body to protect them provide the nuance that fics realistically dealing with the conundrum of house elves require to not be merely explaining away the iffy slave-like nature present in canon and fanon.

Really wish there were fics that discussed these matters, because house elves are really sketchy in canon. It's weird how Hermione and SPEW are treated as a joke by everyone despite fighting what in the seven books is visibly straight-up slavery. Would kill for Rowling to have either painted Hermione starkly in the right or have written in the nuance you have in your post.
