There's also the minor point that we don't know how a house elf would GET to those terrible wizards. They may be bought and sold, as human slaves were, but there's nothing in the books to suggest the existence of such an organised framework - no slave market, no ads in the Prophet saying “house elf for sale, enquire within”.

In the original folklore, the brownies that house elves are based on would often just *appear* in a household and start work, staying there until they were offended somehow/banished with clothes.

If this is what house elves do, then in a sense they do get to choose their people; they choose when and where to show up and the dodgy side of it where they're then stuck serving the terrible descendents of their original chosen humans indefinitely happens a bit later.

If this is NOT what house elves do...what's happening instead?
