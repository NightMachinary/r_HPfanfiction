How do you feel about the mutualistic relationship bandied about in some fics? Ie, house elves live on the magic of wizards, and their servitude is more of a service to match their sustenance proved by wizards. Are these valid explanations for wizard-house elf relations, or are they just lazy attempts to whitewash what is really slavery?
