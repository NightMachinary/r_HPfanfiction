Well, yeah. /Taking/ someone's freedom away from them and making them work /by force/ is wrong.\\
And even if someone gives away their personal freedom for whatever reason, it's wrong to abuse or exploit them just because the opportunity exists.

Or, in more specific terms, even if house-elves in general seek to be magically bound because it raises their status in the eyes of other elves, it's still wrong to forcibly enslave one.\\
And if you do have a house-elf, it's definitely not okay to mistreat him/her like the Malfoys did to Dobby.
