I genuinely agree with this, which makes more sense as to why Winky and Kreacher were how they were. Winky was always trying to drown herself in butterbeer, perhaps similar to someone to who's lost everything. And to her, and it might just be that. Kreacher, who loved Regulus even though he was never a heir or head.
