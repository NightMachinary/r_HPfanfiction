Okay, that's a new one. I don't think I've seen that particular idea before.

Imagine a house-elf in a dementor-esque cloak: "Mua-ha-ha, I shall devour your happy memories. Have a cookie! Savour it, your gratification at eating it shall be all the sweeter when I take it from you..."

...Omigosh! What if the Dementors of Azkaban are house-elves! Kept on the island by Ekrizdis and barely surviving off his cruel satisfaction and joy at tormenting muggle sailors (and the small amounts of relief from said sailors when the elves did what they could to help them), after Ekrizdis's death, they were trapped by the island's wards, and twisted by the lack of any positive emotions to drink.\\
Once Azkaban was rediscovered, the house-elves of it were twisted into horrible shells of their former selves that had turned to forcibly devouring happy memories to sate their hunger! They wear the black cloaks and float, and never show their faces, in order to conceal how far they've fallen from other house-elves!
