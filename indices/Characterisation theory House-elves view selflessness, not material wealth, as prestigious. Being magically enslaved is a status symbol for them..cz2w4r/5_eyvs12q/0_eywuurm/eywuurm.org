I kinda thought they were another sort of "emovore" that feed on satisfaction like dementors do happiness, just a smart sort that doesn't eat until there's nothing left. They do all the chores a wizard can think of, the wizard feels satisfaction at not having to do it themselves, and then the house-elf eats all their satisfaction until they're just dwelling on tomorrow's chores instead of enjoying their free-time perpetuating the feeding cycle.
