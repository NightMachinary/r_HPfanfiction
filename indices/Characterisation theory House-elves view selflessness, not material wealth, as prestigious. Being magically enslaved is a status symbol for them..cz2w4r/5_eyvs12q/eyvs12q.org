I've always liked the idea that house elves feed/draw on their 'masters' power and that it's a symbiotic relationship that the elves allow wizards to believe is one of master-servant.

This neatly explains why they fear being released - essentially its like a dealer cutting off an addict. Given that we never come across another elf such as Dobby, he may just have been a one-off - or perhaps he was confident that Harry would take him in and he could become a Potter elf if he left the Malfoys.
