Well, many elves do enslave themselves to Hogwarts. And assumedly, there's many at St. Mungo's too, probably acting as nurses, janitors, other menial tasks, etc. Choosing an old family household isn't a bad choice, though, it's just doing a variety of housework for a smaller group of people rather than a narrower task for a public building.

Who knows, though we don't see it in canon, maybe when the world was less civilised, house-elves went out to fight dangerous magical creatures to protect innocents (assuming they had the ascetic-selflessness culture back then, they might not have).\\
Or maybe, the house-elves in Hogwarts are there for the same reason as the students; to learn magic and skilled jobs so that they can go out and do things more world-changing than housekeeping. Like, they might become ninja doctors!
