It makes more sense as a rationalization than as a reason:

If you're happy being a slave, maybe you're just THAT selfless. Makes sense. But that's trying to explain it post-factum.

But if you're THAT selfless, there are better way to sacrifice yourself and help others than enslaving yourself to bigots. Maybe you would go enslave yourself to Hogwarts or St Mungo's, or some other cause. But why to old families? I'd bet the old families had some hand in that decision.
