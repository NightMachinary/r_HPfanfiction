Puritanical in the view of the elves who believe selflessness to be the thing of value, like he is giving up not having stuff and the lack of things is the thing of value right? That chant is so good, imagine it in their squeaky voices XD and the other elves would start reacting to people saying 'ice cream', 't shirt', or 'sickle' like wizards do with 'Voldemort', poor little guys.
