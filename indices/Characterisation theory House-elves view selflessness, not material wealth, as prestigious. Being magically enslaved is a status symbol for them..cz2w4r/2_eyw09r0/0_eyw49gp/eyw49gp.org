This is basically my head cannon except i was thinking of them more as monks who take vows to not own anything and to serve others (something religious or spiritual) rather than a status thing (or atleast it being a hidden status thing like virtue signaling).

I always figured they had a culture that valued service and at somepoint some Wizard took advantage of that and now they are slaves instead of beings who can move around helping whatever family or house they choose (which would fit the mythology they are based on more).
