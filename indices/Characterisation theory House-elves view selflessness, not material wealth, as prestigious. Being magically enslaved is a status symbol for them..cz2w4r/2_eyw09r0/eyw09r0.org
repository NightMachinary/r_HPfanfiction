I like this. It also adds a layer to why Dobby refuses Dumbledore's offer for a bigger salary and more vacation time. He wants to be his own man (elf), likely because of the abuse he endured, he never wants to be wholly dependent on anyone else again, but the base instinct to serve others is still there.
