Perhaps Regulus could have, if he asked Kreacher to teach him...but even Regulus didn't think to ask. The wizarding blind spot strikes again.

Can house-elves write? Can they use something like a Quick-Quotes Quill (without the Skeeter flourishes, obviously) to take dictation as they speak? The only way for house elf cultural mores to be discussed respectfully might be for it to come from an elf directly - an unusually outspoken one, or one with a REALLY trusting relationship with the humans of the household, so they could trust that they wouldn't be punished or otherwise suffer if the text was released.

I think I'd kind of love for Luna to ask? She's...basically completely unconcerned by what other humans think of her anyway, so she might actually make the attempt!
