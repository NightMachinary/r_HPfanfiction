Could she (especially at 14, all fired up at the injustice) have asked in a tactful enough way to get the answer?

Remember, when she tried to have a conversation with Winky about the Crouch family and how they'd treated her, Winky effectively told her to shut up and not stick her nose in things she didn't understand.

It would have to be a very, very tactful approach to avoid giving offence.
