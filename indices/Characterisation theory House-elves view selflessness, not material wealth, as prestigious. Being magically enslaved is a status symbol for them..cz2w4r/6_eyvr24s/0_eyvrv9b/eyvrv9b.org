Well, she IS ignorant to a lot of things about the magical world. She knows more than Harry, because she reads every relevant text she can get her hands on, but she's still coming from a society with profoundly different ideas about indentured servitude. When she's 14 and starting to get really enthusiastic about SPEW, this is quite possibly the first time she's ever had to think about a (very) non-human life form that's nevertheless both as sentient and as sapient as humans are. *Of course* she's going to bring a lot of her own existing preconceptions to how she thinks about that, both the good/useful ones AND the flawed ones.

Plus...even if she DID read up, what are the chances that a text written by a wizard author could tell her what she needed to know about house elf status symbols or the things that elves valued? Wizards are *incredibly bad* at considering the point of view of any of the other intelligent species. They infuriate the goblins with their ignorance twice before breakfast. The centaurs as well. And the merfolk. A wizarding author, comfortably convinced of his own superiority, would bring a set of assumptions that were just as flawed.

It would take a very thoughtful, very thorough and extremely open minded wizard to start to write such a book. Who else would approach house elves, *ask* (not demand) to be taught by them about their culture and values and then discuss what he found out without being too biased or condescending to be useful?
