Any attempt to rationalize slavery as some type of good thing is gonna be a no-go for me. Everything you brought up is also easily explained by the canon explanation of centuries of abuse and gaslighting.

Let's free the House elves and give them the opportunity to go to school and own businesses before assuming it's something they don't want. There's going to be a difference between elves that were born into slavery and so all they know is cleaning, and a child elf who has no preconceived notions about the world.
