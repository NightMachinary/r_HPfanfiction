Yeah, I know, but that also isn't very logical. Despite being Arcturus only son, Orion is sort of a loser. I imagine he didn't just marry his first cousin because of her pureblood. Would Arcturus and Pollux really give Orion the Black Ancestral Home and then not fight to get it back from Walburga once she loses both sons if that's THE Black Ancestral Home? I think that if GP was significant, Walburga's father and uncle would have tried to wrestle the place out of her hands once Regulus dies and Sirius is imprisoned.
