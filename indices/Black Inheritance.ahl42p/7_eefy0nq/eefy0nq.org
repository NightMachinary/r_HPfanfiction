Aright so Arcturus is not that closely related to Cygnus Black. They are rather distant cousins with the same surname. Secondly when Arcturus dies, yes Sirius is in Azkaban and cannot use any of the Black fortune or estates but Arcturus doesn't know what will happen! Maybe Sirius will be released on compassionate grounds or is freed after a coup. He did escape and his inherited wealth sheltered him quite well!

The big thing is that Arcturus is a non entity we know nothing about his motivation. Maybe he dislike Cygnus to the point that he wanted to spite him by placing the fortune outside of his reach for another decade. Maybe he just didn't care, all his family are dead or in prison. He is a pure blood without a bloodline.

Now you might be thInking about an estate entail which can occur in some estates where certain property and privileges are attached to a title of a certain process of inheritance. This is now widely illegal as it is seen as controlling beyond the grave.
