  Now you might be thInking about an estate entail which can occur in some estates where certain property and privileges are attached to a title of a certain process of inheritance. This is now widely illegal as it is seen as controlling beyond the grave.

No title required. Fee tail was just another form of property ownership, like fee simple (aka freehold). Before it was abolished, anyone could pass property on to their heirs as a fee tail, no title or even grand estate required. You could have done it with a 1 bedroom studio apartment if you wanted.
