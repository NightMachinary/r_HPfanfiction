Well, yes, I know they are not that closely related, but the books stating that Sirius got the property because he was the last male heir makes me think that being male and carrying the Black name especially was very important to the whole family. With Sirius in prison and unable to have an heir and pass the name along, Cygnus would really be only male Black carrying the name living by the time Arcturus dies, and Narcissa is conceivably the only person who could have a male grandchild who could take on the Black name.

Arcturus thinking Sirius would ever leave Azkaban would be crazy. The reason why it was shocking when Sirius did it was because it had never been (publicly) done. And there's no real explanation in the books about how Sirius is able to access his wealth while on the run (not even a 'Goblins don't care that I'm a fugitive'). If Arcturus disliked Cygnus very much, I could imagine him refusing to change the rules making everything of his go to Sirius, but Cygnus would have a decade to try to get the inheritance through legal or very underhanded ways.
