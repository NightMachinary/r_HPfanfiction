And yet Sirius did get out and the property served him well. Sirius was the first to “publicly” break out, maybe Arcturus knew of other cases beforehand. He might have been released if there was a regime change. Think about all the people who came out of the gulags and camps in other countries. You don't know what could happen!

If Arcturus does not Cygnus then he is not going to give him everything just because one of his grandchildren might take his name. They would do it for Cygnus's money. Besides of his three daughter at the time of Arcturus's death 1 is also in Azkaban another is a blood traitor with a teenage daughter and the last one has only 1 son and no sign of others. Hardly as promising as you make them out to be.

Yes Cygnus would have all the time in the world to scheme the money but if Arcturus doesn't like him then forcing him to spend time and money on something he could have gotten for free would be very satisfying.
