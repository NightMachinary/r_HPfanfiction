I wonder if the fact that Sirius didn't get a trial had anything to do with it all, he was never convicted of a crime, just thrown in jail. Now, of course, everyone thought he was guilty, but I don't know.. though I also wonder why Arcturus Black would sit and do nothing for 10 years if the person he had named heir didn't get a trial.
