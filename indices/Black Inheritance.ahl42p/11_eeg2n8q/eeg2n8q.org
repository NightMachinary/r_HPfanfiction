I think A Marauder's Plan explained the inheritance well. His grandfather recognized that Sirius's parents are batshit insane and made Sirius his heir instead of his parents. He did support the pureblood mantra but he recognized Voldie for what he is, a psycho who's only out for himself.

Further he realized that Sirius was innocent, but refrained from forcing a trial because of a prophecy. Don't want to spoil more at this point.
