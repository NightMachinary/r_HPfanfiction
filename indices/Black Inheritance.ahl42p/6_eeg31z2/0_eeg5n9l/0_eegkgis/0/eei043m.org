I think the most famous fic where she's a significant character is The Reclamation of Black Magic, but they fudge a few things in that few (they make Dorea Black Harry's grandmother). I don't know if I would say the magical world is necessarily patriarchal, but families like the Malfoys and Blacks obviously are, which is why I think that Sirius being unable to provide a male heir to continue the line would be more important to Arcturus than anything.
