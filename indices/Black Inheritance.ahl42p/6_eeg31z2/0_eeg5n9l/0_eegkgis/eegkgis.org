I have actually never heard about Lucretia in any fic I've read and didn't know she was a thing (maybe I missed it?). The magical world was always patriarchal for me because of how backwards it is in many aspects so a female inheriting never came into question for me.

There simply was never a better option for Arcturus in my mind. If Sirius would have died in Azkaban the inheritance would have fallen to Draco.
