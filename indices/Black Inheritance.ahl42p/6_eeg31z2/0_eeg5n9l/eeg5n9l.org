No, there isn't. Counter question: if it's not a matter of Sirius simply being the default heir but a matter of Arcturus wanting to leave his money to someone he respects, and he doesn't respect anyone involved that believes in purity, why the hell wouldn't he leave it to his daughter, who married a pureblood and was still alive at the time?

It's fine if you think Arcturus hated Cygnus or Lucius for some reason. But I don't see Sirius being the only person he would like or respect, unless you mean the only man in the family he respected. But that's implying Arcturus agreed with Sirius's politics but didn't respect Ignatius Prewett, and we don't know what kind of person Prewett was, but Sirius was openly friends with muggleborns and werewolves. I mean if you want an heir who you respect who will not further the Black name, at least Lucretia and her husband weren't in prison.

Sirius is the heir not because Arcturus likes him personally, but because the family cares about their legacy and the continuation of the Black name (via male heirs). Sirius couldn't continue the Black name from Azkaban, so whether Arcturus liked him was irrelevant.
