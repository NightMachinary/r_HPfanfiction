Counter question to you:

Is there anywhere said that Arcturus actually supports Voldemort? Yes, he obviously supported the pureblood belief, but did he recognize Voldie as his master?\\
Because I don't think so. That being said, he wouldn't be happy with Malfoy submitting himself to Voldie. I like to believe that while he didn't share the same believes as Sirius, he was the only Black he still respected at the end, because he didn't submit himself to another master and was still an independent Black.
