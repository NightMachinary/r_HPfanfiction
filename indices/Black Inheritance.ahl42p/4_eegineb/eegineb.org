This really depends on if you believe Magical Houses and Lordships are a thing. If they are, there is a Noble and Ancient House of Black, with a title, money, and properties. The properties of this family could be entailed to only pass down to male heirs of the family, which would mean Sirius would slowly inherit everything after the death of his older family members. There may have been inheritance law preventing Cygnus from passing anything down to non-Black grandchildren. This is all conjecture of course.

I don't think Noble Houses and Lordships actually exist in canon. I think Sirius was mocking his family when he referred to it as the "noble and ancient house." It may have made more sense for his parents to own the bulk of the Black properties compared to any of his aunts and uncles since his parents were both Blacks. Whatever Sirius inherited was first owned to some extent by his parents. I don't think GP is the only property in the Estate either, it was just the most viable for him to offer to the Order due to its location. It's possible that the other properties were not owned by his parents and passed down to him, or that they were unsuitable to be Headquarters (ex: too publicly known, charms preventing non pureblood from entering, in disrepair, etc.).

It is also unclear what being disowned/blasted off the tapestry means in the Black family. Some fics have it where Sirius wasn't really disowned because he was the male heir, but that he assumed he was. Sirius could have just been removed from inheriting anything in the family estate, but was able to inherit his parents' property. Walburga may have been insane when she died and had not changed her will that gave anything to surviving children
