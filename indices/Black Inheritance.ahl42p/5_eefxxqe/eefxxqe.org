In some more Germanic law, you cannot disinherit your child. It could be that the wizarding society's law is based on that. In English law, you can disinherit your child, but it requires a lot of formalities, and if the child is a minor or is an adult who cannot support themselves, they can still lay claim against your inheritance. As Sirius cannot support himself in prison, he would stand to inherit a bit. In both these cases, the best way to make sure that the person you wish to inherit, is given your estate before you die. In Sirius' case, this could for example mean already telling the goblins to transfer his entire estate to Harry in name, and continue using it in his position of being Harry's guardian.
