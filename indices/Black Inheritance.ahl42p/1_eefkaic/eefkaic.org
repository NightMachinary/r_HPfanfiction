I think Rowling had in mind the way the traditional aristocratic system in Britain works (see the Royal Family) and the way titles (and along with those, the ancestral seats) were inherited. By tradition, Arcturus's position would have gone to his eldest son first (Orion) then his eldest son's eldest son (Sirius). It is irrelevant that Orion predeceased Arcturus. It would only have moved to another branch of the family if Orion had had no children (or no sons if primogeniture was practised which seems to be the case).

It is inconsistent though, as it seems Sirius had the autonomy to leave Grimmauld Place to Harry rather than it reverting to another branch of the family. So maybe tradition and blood purity was held to be more important by the Black family. There is no title involved. Fics which include 'Lord Black' really set my teeth on edge.
