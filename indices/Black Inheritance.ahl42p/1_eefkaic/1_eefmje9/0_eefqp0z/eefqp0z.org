I think the issue is that you are automatically assuming he loses inherritance rights just because he is in prison.

This may not be the case. If say, his account was just frozen, then his inhertitance after he dies would follow his will. Also, what would they sue him for? Being in jail? That is not a legal reason to take someone elses property/money away from them
