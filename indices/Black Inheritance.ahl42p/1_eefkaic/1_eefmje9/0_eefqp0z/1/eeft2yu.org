No, you're completely right that it's not. And I agree with you that anything that was in his name would have been inaccessible to him in life, but would go to Harry in death. But yes, I do assume he could have lost the right to inherit when he went to prison, but not automatically. When I talk about legal recourse, I mean his grandfather, who was still living in 1990 and would conceivably own GP, trying to change the first male heir rule that would have had everything automatically go to Sirius, since it's assumed Sirius will die without a blood heir.

It wouldn't be about taking property that is already Sirius's away from him, but from making sure, if the rule really is that first male son gets everything, that Arcturus can leave his inheritance to Cygnus (who he couldn't have known would die a year later). I agree that Arcturus probably wouldn't have been able to sue it out of Sirius if he got it from Orion, I made that sound really stupid, and I'm sorry. My curiosity, I guess, stems from the fact that had Orion possessed the deed of the house and had the ability to leave it to Sirius, he wouldn't have. He disinherits Sirius before he dies in 79. If the house always passed to the last male heir, like Dumbledore tells Harry in HPB, I do wonder if Sirius's legal status wouldn't haven't made him ineligible to inherit anything when his grandfather dies.

And this is really long-winded and perhaps still confusing, and I'm sorry (I guess I love Hermione because we both love logical puzzles).
