Also, consider the fact that Sirius was never convicted IN A TRIAL. As far as I understand, since it is illegal to imprison someone without a trial, that person technically isn't a criminal--there never being a trial to confirm such. Also (as I understand law), isn't a court order or a search warrant (often to provide the court with evidence) needed to freeze accounts.

No, I think that--yes, Lord Black, etc., is stupid. But because Sirius never had a trial, legally, he never was "oust" from being a contestant for the title (if it ever existed--which it doesn't); which would have gone from Arcturus => Orion => Sirius.
