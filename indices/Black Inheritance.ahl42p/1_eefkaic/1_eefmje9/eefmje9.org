I agree with you on the aristocracy point, but the problem is exactly that inconsistency, because titles can't be left to the person of your choice in a will, and even if there isn't a title (and I don't think there is; I also hate Lordship fics), if their inheritance system followed traditional aristocratic systems, anything that ended up belonging to Sirius would be reverted to Draco, despite of Sirius's will. Mostly, I don't think Orion's death is the most important factor, but Sirius's imprisonment is, because it would have removed him from any traditional line of succession. If Charles died, William would still be the next in line. But if Harry died without children, William was sentenced to life in prison and he didn't have children, and then Charles died, the line of succession would be reconfigured. Sirius is a fugitive when he dies, so I can't imagine he regained any legal power. But he takes possession of his home, a house that I would imagine would have been passed down the line once he was sentenced to life in prison. I really don't see why Arcturus or Cygnus couldn't have sought legal recourse to have anything of value removed from Sirius once it's clear the line will end with him and he's in Azkaban. Put it simply, Sirius could be easily removed from any inheritance line because of his sentence, and if it's an issue of last male in line gets to override any claims via will, last male in line would have been Cygnus due to Sirius's legal status.
