Yeah, I think you're right that JK just wanted Harry to get the house so he could get the locket. Plus having the only place where he really spent time with Sirius and Buckbeak got to Draco might have been a blow too many at that point. I'm not too hard on JK for creating plot-holes like this, to be honest. But I think I've read way too many fics where this is a plot point and it's always done poorly, and I wanted to see if anyone has an explanation why it would be logical.
