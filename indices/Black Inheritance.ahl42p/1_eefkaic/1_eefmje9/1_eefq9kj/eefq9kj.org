I agree it's inconsistent. Frankly, I think that it's another thing Rowling didn't really think through but I still think that was the fuzzy reasoning she had in mind. It wouldn't have been very difficult for her to work out something more plausible. But that said, those details have never worried me too much. Sirius and Grimmauld Place are all I ever wanted from canon really, so this is one thing I don't complain about.
