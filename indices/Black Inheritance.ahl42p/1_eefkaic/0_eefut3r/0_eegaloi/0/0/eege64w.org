There is one I know and can't remember the title of, but it's with indy super!Harry and Dumbledore bashing.... Harry was emancipated, Dumbledore passed a law that made it illegal to get back his guardianship but they get around it by getting tonks to be his guardian. Was sadly not plot relevant but I like the idea.
