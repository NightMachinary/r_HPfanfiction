I always assumed that after Sirius's arrest, the Black family was overjoyed that he'd finally chosen the right side, and wrote him back into their wills. Sirius was never actually sentenced to life in prison, he was just thrown in prison, so his family may have assumed he'd be getting out later, especially if some new pureblood supremacist administration took over the Ministry and freed the heroic, wrongfully imprisoned Death Eaters.
