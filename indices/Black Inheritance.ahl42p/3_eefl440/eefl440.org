I personally haven't seen anywhere it is tried to be explained effectively, most of the time the author has Sirius simply say "Arcturus died after my parents and he liked me and never disinherited me, my mother just burnt my face off the tree".

Some ways that I have seen the inheritance fics done, not only the estate fics but also the lordship fics, is that the Black Family as well as other old families (Longbottom's, Potter's etc.), has its own magic that tries to keep to the direct line and chooses those based on how the magic manifested itself.

For example, the Black Family's motto is the manifestation of its magic, the magic would test Sirius as a successor before then looking at the next possible candidate, and based on what you think Cygnus would do, he wouldn't pass, because Toujours Pur really means always pure of heart and actions, not pureblood. For the record, I don't believe that's what the motto means, it's just how I see it done.

But as others have said in the past, it's basically just a way of making Harry overpowered in all possible facets, magically, financially, politically etc. allowing him to take 10 Lordships and beat Voldemort.
