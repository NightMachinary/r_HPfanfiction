Most fics going Arcturus liked him route seems to have Arcturus aiming to get him out of Azkaban., the ones I have seen at least.

Yeah, you're right, there are too many plotholes, that's why a lot of fics that include it don't explain it well. There is not really a logical situation because magic seems to me to be the only answer, which is inherently difficult to understand in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Perhaps the Ministry of Magic could have laws saying that family estates are determined by the head of the family or family as a whole, the legal status not in question. In your original post, you have literally covered every possible reason why it would make no sense as to why Sirius would be heir.

I think GP became a garbage place no one cared about because they all thought Walburga was crazy. Cygnus for all we know could have been like Alphard, and liked Sirius and wanted him to be the head of the family. Narcissa isn't likely to care as she always appeared to me more Malfoy than Black and also she is the youngest of 3, but I certainly agree that Lucius would like to get his greedy little mitts on the estate, not just GP.

The best way to explain Harry getting it was the fact that the fandom had reason to believe that Harry was the Grandson of Charlus & Dorea Potter nee Black, but Pottermore changed that to Fleamont & Euphemia. Some writers still use the former.
