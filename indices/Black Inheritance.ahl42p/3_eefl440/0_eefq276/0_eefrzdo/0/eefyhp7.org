Oh, I don't think I've read any of those. I've read a couple where Arcturus is still alive when is cleared, but never Arcturus being the one to do it. That's actually interesting, though it would still be weird for him to pass without a viable heir, at least that makes more sense.

Well, Cygnus disinherited Andromeda and while Sirius still got some money, Andromeda got nothing. I guess that always gave me the impression that he was pretty strict about purity as well. It could be that with Bella in prison, Andie gone, and Narcissa married well, he didn't care much what happened to the Black property or Black legacy, but that would mean he was very different than most people in the family. I think Lucius and Narcissa might not care for any of the Black properties, but if they felt Draco was entitled to it, they would certainly fight for it. Entitlement was a huge part of their personalities. At the very least, I imagine Lucius would want any dark artifacts or rare books that were in the family, but I think they would also deem that anything else was rightfully theirs.

I believed that for a while as well, but I don't think that would make much sense. Dorea was supposed to be Pollux's sister, so she was on Narcissa's side of the line. That would make Draco's claim stronger than Harry's.

I really think that most logical explanation would be for GP not to be all that important in the first place, and Sirius not having inherited anything of importance at all. But that does run counter what Dumbledore tells Harry about Sirius being the last male heir, so ...
