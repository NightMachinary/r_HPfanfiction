Yeah, I've seen it explained that way as well, but Arcturus liking him would be a bit irrelevant if Arcturus thought Sirius would be pissing himself for the rest of his life in prison.

I think the magic thing is interesting, but there are potentially too many plot holes. So Cygnus isn't pure of heart, but Sirius, who nearly killed a kid through a prank, is pure? It's the pure of heart thing basically not being a bigot? Because we know that Sirius isn't always kind. I think an unique, magical system that isn't tied to Sirius legal status would be an interesting explanation, but I can't think of a good, logical system, to be honest.

I agree that Black inheritance is really overused in OP Harry fics, but I see it come up in other fics as well. I read a lot of fic about the Black sisters and I've rarely seen Narcissa inherit anything from Cygnus (unless she divorces Lucius; then miraculously, she is in charge of the Black Estate). I've never seen a fic where Lucius and Narcissa try to bribe the Ministry to declare Sirius legally incapable of inheriting so Draco gets anything of value from the Black Estate, for example, and though Lucius is filthy rich, you'd think he'd want anything of value that he felt his kid was entitled to, no? I just find it really weird that in a family that so obsessed with their tradition and status, no one, not even the greedy ones like Lucius, would put up a fight to get a house that has been in the family for centuries. Either GP was a garbage place no one cared about, or both canon and fanon haven't explained very well how Harry ends up with it.
