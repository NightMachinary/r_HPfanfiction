What I like to think is that Arcturus hates Cygnus and the Malfoys with a passion, and he'd rather have his heir in prison than giving money to the Malfoys. If you want to go to the more dramatic path, then you can say that he tried to get Sirius out of jail but Lucius killed him (poison, assassin....) before he could do it.
