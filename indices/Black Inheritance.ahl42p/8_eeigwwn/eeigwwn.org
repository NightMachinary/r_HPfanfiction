The idea that pureblood families function as an aristocracy is a purely fanon idea. They may be rich, but that's about all they have going for them. Other magical families (the Weasleys, the Potters, the Diggorys, the Lovegoods) are shown as just normal families in terms of structure and political influence. There is really no mention of anyone having an “heir” in the sense that fanon tends to think of. (Heir of Slytherin is its own thing, and has nothing to do with aristocracy). Fics that talk about 11 years olds being manor lords or whatever are really grating, since the only mention of a “lord” is with Voldemort, and it's just a title he made himself. Lucius is never referred to as “Lord Malfoy,” it's always Mister. With the Black family, I don't think that “the most ancient and noble house” is supposed to be taken as literally as fanon has taken it (“house potter” for example). These aren't houses, they're just families. Considering that Sirius was blasted off the family tree I think it's definitely likely that the wealth of the Black family was passed on to Draco. However, I also think that people overestimate how much money pureblood families have. They're rich, sure, but they don't have trillions of galleons or whatever like in fanfiction. I imagine that the amount Draco hypothetically inherited was comparable to the amount of money a trust fund kid would have in the muggle world.
