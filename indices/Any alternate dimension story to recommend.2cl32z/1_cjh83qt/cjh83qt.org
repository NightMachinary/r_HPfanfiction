[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] is the obvious one as far as I'm concerned. Includes dimension travel and extremely well written. A lot of humor (had me cackling like Bellatrix at times - it was very melodramatic), adventure, and a healthy sprinkle of angst and drama.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8444317/1/How-Crap-TV-Saved-the-World][How Crap TV Saved the World]] is hilarious and should also be counted as such. Some very, /very/ twisted humor.
