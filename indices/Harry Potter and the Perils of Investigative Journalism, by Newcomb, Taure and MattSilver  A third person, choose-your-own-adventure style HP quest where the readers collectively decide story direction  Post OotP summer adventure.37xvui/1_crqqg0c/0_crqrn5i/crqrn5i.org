This hasn't been my experience with that forum, but I'm a very new to the site. From what I can tell they aren't monolithic. Yes, there /are/ trolls and scads of useless advice given in a haughty, superior tone. But there are also plenty of users who genuinely want to give constructive feedback and help each other out.

Like anywhere else on the internet, it's a mixed bag.
