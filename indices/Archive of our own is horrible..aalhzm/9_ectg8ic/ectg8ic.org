I do think that AO3 is essentially just the dumping grounds for the dregs of fanfiction that don't have a place anywhere else. BUT, FFN is hardly the bastion of quality fanfiction that we like to think it is. Every site has heaps upon heaps of bad fanfiction, so it's really hard to draw a line somewhere without seeming hypocritical.
