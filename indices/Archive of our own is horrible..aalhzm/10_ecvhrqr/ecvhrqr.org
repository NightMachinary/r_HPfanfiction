I have accounts on both FFN and Ao3 and, as a writer, I find Ao3 to be the best available site there is Why? Because tags are extensive to the point where, if you ae not very good at summaries, people can still find and read your story IF you use tags properly.

​

and therein lies the problem.

​

As far as I can see, wrongly tagging a fic has become a problem. You have people who actually don´t tag too much not to spoil a progressing story with major twists- which, IMo is FINE; you have people who apparently does not think tagging is important and yes, you have people purposedly tagging their story wrongly to attract more readers.

​

Now, regarding your rant: there is nothing Ao3, JKR or most of fanfiction writers can do to "solve" this problem. It is up to you, as a reader , NOT to read thos fictions. Believe me, untill I realized how the tagsworked and the kind of people that would abuse it, I read TERRIBlE fics and even then I KNEW that, despite of my opinion, the author had the right to purge all his/hers terrible ideas on paper and that some crazy people out there actually like to read trash.

​

PS: there is also a problem f unmet expectations I myself faced... some readers would try to discuss with me how to tag my fics and had strong opinions about it. So, yes, even if you , as an author, think you are tagging correctly, there will e people thinking you are not.
