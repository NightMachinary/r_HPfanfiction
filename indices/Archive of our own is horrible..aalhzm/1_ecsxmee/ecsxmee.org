Um... no.

I'm pretty sure JK Rowling is aware of the smut, and as far as I know she is pretty tolerant of the fanfiction in general.

Just because you personally don't like smut (which nobody is forcing you to read), it doesn't mean that there aren't people out there who enjoy such content. Most of it /is/ properly labeled and easy to filter, so I don't see how its existence affects you.

I don't see the point of this post. No one is holding a gun to your head, making you browse through Ao3. While I agree that the tagging system is somewhat flawed, it's definitely a lot better than on many other fanfiction sites.
