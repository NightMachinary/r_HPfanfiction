"[...] but fanfiction is legal even when the author doesn't like it - look at all the fics based on Anne Rice books you can still find on AO3, for example. "

​

have you bothered to actually get hold of some proper legal studies on the case? Fanfiction is not blanket legal, not even in Canada which has the most permissive attitude based in the law towards it with Section 29.21 of the Canadian Copyrigth Act. US law is a lot less permissive, and European Union law is especially unpermissive regarding fanfiction, and always has been. If you have studied this piece of law it would be nice to see some sources as to why it is legal and in what jurisdiction.

" Conclusion

Fanfiction is a phenomenon which is here to stay, that much can be seen in the sheer amount of it which can be found. If it is non-infringing however, is less clear, and must be decided upon on a case by case basis [...]. Each and every fanfiction follows its own style and even though one work of fanfiction may resemble another, it are the creative choices made in each individual work which makes it infringing or not. Some works of fanfiction will as such qualify for protection based on for example the parody exception, whereas others -- unfortunately perhaps -- fall short of the protection of such an exception.

The basis for this problem lies in copyright itself. Copyright is the right allocated to the author and subsequent rightsholders after having made an original work [...]. [...]

The moment a work qualifies for copyright protection the rightsholder -- which generally is the author, but in many a jurisdiction such rights can be transferred -- gets guaranteed certain rights. These rights are summarised in many a different ways, but in the EU are the reproduction and adaptation right; the right to communicate to the public; and the distribution right. The USA however assigns six rights to rightsholders, as found in 17 USC § 106. [...]

These various rights are however not unlimited, and are subject to copyright exceptions. These exceptions are nationally based -- just like copyright itself -- and will differ from nation to nation. Canada has introduced a very special exception in 2012, being the UGC-exception, granting farther limits than most countries currently. The way these exceptions are enacted happen in two types of ways. The US has chosen to use a general exception, fair use of 17 USC § 107, whereas the EU has chosen to create a catalogue of specific exceptions -- in article 5 InfoSoc -- which individual EU member states may choose to implement in their own legal system or not. Should however an exception from the catalogue be implemented in a member state's law, those exceptions will generally still be seen as being harmonised.

For a second work, such as a work of fanfiction, to not infringe upon an older work's rightsholder's rights, the work has to either not be a reproduction in any kind of way, or to qualify for protection by an exception available in the country in question, exceptions such as fair use or parody. Under Canadian law this is considered to be a balancing of rights, with for example parody being a user right, which has to be balanced against the rights of the rightsholder of the older work. Under US and EU law it is too much to say the same, but exceptions are certainly a limitation on the reach and scope of the rights granted to rightsholders. Though this is not to say that (human) rights play no part in such a balancing of rights in the EU and the USA.

Any fanfiction must, for it to not be infringing, therefore not copy enough of the original work(s), or be able to qualify for an exception. As shown in the two case studies, two works -- both of which are Star Trek and Babylon 5 crossover [fanfictions] -- can have surprisingly different end results. Star Wreck can qualify for various exceptions and as such is non-infringing, provided it remains non-commercial. Taskforce 43 however, cannot qualify for fair use in the USA, nor for parody in the EU and Canada. The only exception it may qualify for is the UGC-exception of § 29.21 CCA. "
