There's a lot of explicit, weird stuff on AO3 because it was specifically founded to be an archive that would never restrict or purge content, unlike ffn.net or LJ or now Tumblr. But it also has an extremely extensive tagging system - you have to rate your fic (or mark it as not rated), you have to give the major warnings (graphic violence, character death, non-con, and underage; or again mark it as unwarned), and the additional tags section and author's notes make it easy to include additional warnings. And now with the "exclude" function, it's never been easier to filter out things you don't want. Obviously, as with any system, not everyone perfectly follows the rules, but I genuinely can't remember the last time I came across "weird unnatural sex" on AO3 that wasn't tagged.

Furthermore, JKR didn't "allow" people to write fic. Her generally permissive attitude towards it definitely made things easier for fic writers and helped fic go (more) mainstream, but fanfiction is legal even when the author doesn't like it - look at all the fics based on Anne Rice books you can still find on AO3, for example.
