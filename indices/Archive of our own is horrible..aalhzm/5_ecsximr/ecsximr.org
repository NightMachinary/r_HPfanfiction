I have had the opposite experience. Most of the fanfic I read on AO3 (admittedly not a lot in the Harry Potter fandom) tends to be over-tagged, to the point of ridiculousness.

Although I really appreciate it when authors think "Harry and Ginny are 16 and 15 respectively in Book six. If I have them get a little tipsy and make out at Slughorn's Christmas party, I have to put underage and dubious consent (or nonconsent) warnings".

I don't appreciate it when they have 30 tags that essentially give away the entire plot of what you're about to read.
