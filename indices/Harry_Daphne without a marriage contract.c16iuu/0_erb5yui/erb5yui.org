If you read a lot you've probably already read linkffn(A Champion's New Hope) but it doesn't hurt to put it here.

linkffn(Honour Thy Blood) if you don't mind super Harry.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unexpected Friend) is good. The sequel is being written.

linkffn(Partners by muggledad) is ok, just a bit too clich√©.
