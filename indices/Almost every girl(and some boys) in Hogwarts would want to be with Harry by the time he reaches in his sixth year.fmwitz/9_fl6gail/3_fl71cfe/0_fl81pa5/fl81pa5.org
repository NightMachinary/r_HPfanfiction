Maybe, but you also have to take into account that Harry himself was a bit of a dick to girls. It's a scientific fact that boys mature slower than girls, and so even if the girls were crushing on him, nothing could have really happened. We can say that like 1 in 4 people are gay and so 25% are gone. Lets just say that, for the sake of the argument, JUST, 10% of the remaining 75 aren't interested in him. That leaves 65% originally. For a couple of years, till he's, lets say 14, nothing can happen. During this time, he saves the school a bunch of times, but it's never really public. Assuming maybe 5% of people have found relationships by this point, that leaves him with 60%. In fourth year, he goes out with Parvati Patil and that's a FLOP. Word gets around and because he was a DICK to her he loses like 50% of the 60, leaving him with 30%. At the end of that year, it goes down significantly, since no one fucking believes him and he basically only has Ginny for two years. After the chosen one shit, it increases, but he begins to date Ginny, so it doesn't really matter. Just for the heck of it: if we take out people with relationships, maybe 65% MIGHT want to date him.
