From what I remember about being attracted to guys when I was 12-16, none of that matters really. Just knowing of a guy and him having anything interesting about him at all was enough for me to get a crush, and if he was even a little bit attractive, I was a goner. Personality didn't matter yet. Friends didnt matter. It was “I'm sitting next to Matt Kitchen and he's huffing a sharpie and his friends are mean to me, but he has nice hair and pouty lips and I really just want to kiss him despite everything else”.
