I feel like, at least to me, Harry isn't really THAT attractive. Sure, he's famous, and lots of people want that, and he did do all of those things BUT by the time Hary is dating age, all the hype has pretty much died down. He and Ron and Hermione have a pretty tight nit group, and even the "Silver Trio" doesn't really get in. After the end of GoF, people pretty much hate him, and then only believe him in Year 6 which is when the Romild thing happens, so it's safe to assume that's when it started. From Philosophers Stone to PoA, he's only like 11-13, and still looks little and scrawny. He has his friends and though he's part of the quidditch team, he tries his HARDEST to stay out of the spotlight. He's also pretty tiny in GoF and then the Voldemort returns fiasco happens as soon as he grows up... I can see post DH Harry getting hit on A LOT. Though to me, Ron was definitely the more attractive one- book Ron, to clarify.
