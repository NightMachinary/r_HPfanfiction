Depends on what you term 'dating age'. 15-16? At 15 Harry gets the hot, older girl he's interested - it ends after they both get to know each other better. But the attraction is there.

At 16, the story is out. He's literally the Chosen One and it's common knowledge he's faced Voldemort multiple times. The hype died down? The hype is in overdrive.
