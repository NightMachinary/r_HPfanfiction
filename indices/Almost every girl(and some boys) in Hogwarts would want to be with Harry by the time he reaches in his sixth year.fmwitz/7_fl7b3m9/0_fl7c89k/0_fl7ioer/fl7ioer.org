I swear I recall James being described as handsome and tall. I know Sirius, like you said, is describe as handsome but at one point Madam Rosmerta says they could have been brothers which implied they not only spent all their time together but looked alike (and I mean they're related, distantly or closely idk). James was also very confident which implies good-looking. Sure, you can be ugly and confident but I don't think that's the vibe JKR was going for with James.
