But you also have to take into account that the actors were cast as children. We had no idea how tall or stocky they would be, or even how handsome. I completely agree on hermione tho, Emma is beautiful and Hermione's looks were very well stated as plain bordering ugly. I see where some of your points are coming from but I guess I'll still have to disagree. I just take it as Sirius and James both being deadly handsome therefore Harry is. 🤷🏻‍♀️
