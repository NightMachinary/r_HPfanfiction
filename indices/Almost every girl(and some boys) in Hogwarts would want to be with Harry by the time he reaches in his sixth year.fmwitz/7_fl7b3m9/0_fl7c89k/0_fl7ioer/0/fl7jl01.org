i thought the implication that they could be brothers is because they literally spent all their time together. I'd have to reread that passage. it's from book 3 where harry is overhearing about the fidelius charm.

tbh i know lots of dudes who really aren't all that good looking but are just really outgoing. looks definitely help you become more confident and outgoing but if you're just that type of personality as long as you aren't hideous you can be very popular. most people would be attractive if they just put more effort into self care, clothing and working out but then that would probably raise the bar on attractiveness.

I believe in a quote at one point, jk rowling imagined the trio as more "nerdy" looking than the actors that played them. I think ron is mostly spot on except i imagined book ron as having a thinner build so maybe more like the twins actors. obviously emma watson is gorgeous and hermione was not supposed to be that pretty. if you look at like the art that was on the original books it seems like daniel radcliffe's build is completely off of harry potter
