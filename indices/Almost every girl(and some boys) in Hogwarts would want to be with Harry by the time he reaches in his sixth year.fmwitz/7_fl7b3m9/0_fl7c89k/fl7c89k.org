I agree with you there that Daniel Radcliffe isnt really that hot. He definitely takes care of himself so in that respect hes probably above average but if he wasnt a famous child actor he wouldnt really be that successful at tinder IMO.

James potter was never described as handsome. Sirius was the one described as handsome. But at least book Harry has some height going for him. Hes probably maybe 5'10 or 5'11 by book 6?
