In my opinion, Daniel Radcliffe is not above average, he is strictly average in looks sometimes even below average (that doesn't mean I don't respect him or love him as Harry). But, in the books Harry is described as looking exactly like James who was canonically dashingly handsome, intelligent, tall, and a chick-magnet. Harry, also, has bright bright green eyes and black hair. Even without any other redeeming qualities many students would be falling head over heels for the tall dark and handsome with "jewel" colored eyes look.
