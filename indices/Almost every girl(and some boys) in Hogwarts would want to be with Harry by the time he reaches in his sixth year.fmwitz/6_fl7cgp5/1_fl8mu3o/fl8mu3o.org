  Just his broom is one that professionals use. So I guess it would be like if he had the most expensive sneakers? Or like some kind of professional level gear?

Now, I don't necessarily think that he flies at a professional level - the one time he sees actual professionals play, he's incredibly impressed, it's unlike anything that he's seen.

However, to compare brooms to something like sneakers for running is definitely an off comparison because even the most advanced running shoe doesn't require skill to use. I think that a better comparison would be something like a stock car for Nascar; it requires skill and practice to use well; if a regular driver were to try and use a stock car, they wouldn't drive it effectively and would end up crashing. I think that brooms are the same way. I think that there's likely a reason that most school age Quidditch players don't have Firebolts goes beyond money, I think it's likely that the pure ability to control the broom is a skill. It can be something natural - a category that Harry clearly falls into - or it can be a learned skill, otherwise they wouldn't have flying lessons for first years.
