I think at the very least ron was always at his hip except for that couple week in book 4 when they were fighting.

I honestly dont think harry was alone very often from the parts that are written. We dont see a lot of slice of life. They would do all their classes together, eat together and study together. The only other time I can think of when harry is alone are during detentions and when harry wasnt allowed to go to hogsmeade.
