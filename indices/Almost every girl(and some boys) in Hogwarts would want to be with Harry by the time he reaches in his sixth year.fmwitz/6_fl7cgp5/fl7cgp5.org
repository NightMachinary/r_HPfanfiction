He's specifically the only quidditch player to be a first year in 100 years at hogwarts. Also I dont think it says anywhere that his skills were professional level. Just his broom is one that professionals use. So I guess it would be like if he had the most expensive sneakers? Or like some kind of professional level gear?

People might find it hard to approach him if he is always hanging out with hermione and ron though. Plus everyone probably assumes that he is dating hermione.

Although tbh people might think he murdered Cedric himself. Just to beat the competition or something. You have a dude go into a maze and then come out with his opponent's dead body. Not a good look.

I dont think many are aware of the corporeal patronus.
