Harry wouldn't he very relatable if he had fake friends and girls throwing themselves at him on every occasion. There's a lore explanation for everything, but the biggest reason is just that it doesn't make for as compelling a character. There have been much worse assholes in fiction and in real life who did better with women than Harry did.
