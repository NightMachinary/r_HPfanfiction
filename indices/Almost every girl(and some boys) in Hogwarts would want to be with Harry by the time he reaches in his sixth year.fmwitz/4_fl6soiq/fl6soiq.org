Well, without "everyone" wanting a piece of him, Canon Harry is already pretty popular. I remember Rowling saying that he "inherithed the good look of both his parents" (but it was probably on Pottermore and it's not in the book so not really canon. But even without this, in the book (ignoring the first 3 years because he was too young) :

- 4th Year : before the Yull Ball, girls where often looking at him in group, having giggle. If not for his focus on Cho, and his general lack of knowledge, a lot of girls would have agreed to go with him to the ball, probably dumping a previously chosen date to do so (almost a shame that of all Hogwarts, he had to ask the only girl who was asked by a older, handsome, almost perfect fellow champion).
- 5th Year : despite the Daily Prophet and the Ministry doing his best to destroy his reputation, he still managed to go out with Cho who is described as a above average girl (who was probably not in the best state of mind after Cedric death but it's a detail)
- 6th Year : As the Chosen One, he could have asked around 80% of the school female population and received a positive response (so pretty much any girl outside of the worst blood supremacist and the one already in a pretty serious relation). Romilda Vane was the only one trying a love potion, but not the only one thinking about it. But Harry was too busy dealing with "the monster in his chest" and each time he saw Ginny and his daily Draco stalking to notice other girls.
- 7th Year, on the run most of the year. Could have bedded 70% of the wizarding population after it but already in a relation with Ginny.

So yeah, without being swarmed by girls, he seemed already very popular, especially when you see all the shitstorm that always follow him.
