1.  Which always comes with scorn and envy but sure. Take this one.
2.  2. They're not necessarily on par. In fact, we don't know. Krum says 'you fly well', that's pretty much it. He might've simply been polite, seeing as he was glad Harry wasn't with Hermione, but even if he meant it, it doesn't really mean much.
3.  Yes, with lots of help, stupid amounts of luck, and circumstances. He was very brave though. If I were mean, I might argue that he was beyond reckless.
4.  All the tasks have been made easier for him. In point of fairness, the same could be said for all the other champions, too. Still, Harry didn't really do much except 'fly' -- which he is very proficient with, granted.
5.  Above average, yeah. But since we don't really know the grades of people like Malfoy (who seemed to have tested in his OWLs (which weren't influenced by Snape) an O in Potions and at least an E in Defense) that doesn't really mean much.
6.  He's got better nerves than Hermione. In actual spellwork she's almost always better, and she's better with the theory. Harry just doesn't lose his head as often (see Y3 final test or her nerves before the OWLs).
7.  He can -- with lots of one on one teaching sessions nobody but him was allowed to attend. Still, he can do it -- fair's fair.
8.  He is ridiculously +selfless+ reckless, emotionally somewhat underdeveloped, and somewhat prone to act without thinking. But yes -- kind and brave, too.
9.  Not necessarily. But he's doing okay.
10. I'm not a specialist on sources that aren't the books, but I happen to know that Rowling once admitted that Harry, Hermione, and Ron kind of look too good in the movies. Harry and Hermione really were more average kind of people, physically.
