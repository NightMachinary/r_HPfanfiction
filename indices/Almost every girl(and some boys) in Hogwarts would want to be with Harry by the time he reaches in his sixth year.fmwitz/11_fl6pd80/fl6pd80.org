There's is or was a slash fic (Drarry) along these lines . . Harry shows up for 7th year looking extremely hunky but is totally oblivious (in a befuddled way) to all of the attempts being made flirt with him by almost everyone in the castle.

It was a very cute fic - yes, it H/D but it was very PG. Also written before any of the horcrux stuff happened in the books and before anyone realized DR wasn't going to be 6' tall. Don't remember the name of the fic and I've been looking for it for several years.
