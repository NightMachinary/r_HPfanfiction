I'm glad someone else pointed this out. He isn't malicious, but he's definitely a thoughtless jackass when it comes to romance and most non-explicit feelings in general. You can give him a pass as a reader because he's just stunted from his years being raised by the Dursleys and he genuinely means well, but if I were a girl in Hogwarts who knew him casually, I wouldn't touch that mess with a ten foot pole. Even as a teenager, I had neither the time nor the patience to hold a boy's hand and explain why it's dickish to ask me out as a last resort and then ignore me for the whole dance while he eyes another boy's date. And if I went though that, I'd warn all my female friends not to bother with him, tragic backstory or no tragic backstory.
