Except canon Harry is a bit of a prick to girls.

He asks Parvati to the ball, and ignores her after the first obligatory dance, making eyes at another girl. He sets up her sister with Ron, who is an even worse date to Parvati's sister.

He goes on a date with Cho, and tells her that he has to meet Hermione - someone who nearly any girl will feel threatened over, especially seeing as people believe they were together at some point, thanks to Rita Skeeter's gossip.

Then, when Luna, one of his friends, finds herself under the mistletoe with him, he jumps out of there like he was a eunuch. He goes with Luna to Slughorn's Christmas party, and leaves without so much as a goodbye to Luna.
