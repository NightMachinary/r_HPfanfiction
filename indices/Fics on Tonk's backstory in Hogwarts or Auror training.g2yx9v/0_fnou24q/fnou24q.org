There is quite a lot in linkffn(Innocent, MarauderLover7) I think, but it's not really canon compliant as it mainly tells the story of how Sirius saved Harry from the Dursleys before Hogwarts and their life during the Hogwarts years. But there are definitively a few chunks that focus on Tonks and her auror training with Moody and these are some of my favourite bits of the story.
