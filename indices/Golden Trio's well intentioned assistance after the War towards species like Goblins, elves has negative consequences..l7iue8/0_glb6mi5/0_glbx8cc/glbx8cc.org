Oh the bigots definitely aren't right. The elves revert to their bloody selves mainly because of the way wizards have treated them all these years. Also my prompt doesn't only consider elves. There are countless other species in the Wizarding world. Goblins, Centaurs, Dwarves, and what not. The premise of my prompt lies in the possibility that any of these species decides to revolt when the Wizarding world is most distracted; the second Wizarding War. Of course there would be factions within their ranks advocating for peace (think Dobby and Firenze). Actually you know what? I'll add this to my post.
