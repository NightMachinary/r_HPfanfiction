An interesting idea but pretty hard to put in place.

First of all, you need Ron and Harry to save this person, Hermione had to be saved because she was crying alone (because of something Ron said), and they went to save here because of remorse and chivalry.

​

As for what it would change, well they would struggle a lot. Hermione does have a big role in the serie, mainly to explain the plot.Like I really like Neville and would love to see him having a bigger role, but while a Neville can help to identify and pass the Devil Snare in the 1st book, or even identify the philosophal Stone (maybe by asking his grandma), I don't see him (or Harry), passing Snape test.I also like the potential implications in the book 2. Like was Hermione attacked just because she was a Muggleborn, or was a part of the attack due the the fact she found the monster was a basilisk. If it's the case, a Pureblood friend (or at least a non Muggleborn one) attacked would make the situation even scarier, the pureblood understanding even them are not safe.

​

PS: Really improbable without making both very OOC. But I would love to see a friend! Draco attacked because he found the monster and Lucius losing his shit after learning about it.
