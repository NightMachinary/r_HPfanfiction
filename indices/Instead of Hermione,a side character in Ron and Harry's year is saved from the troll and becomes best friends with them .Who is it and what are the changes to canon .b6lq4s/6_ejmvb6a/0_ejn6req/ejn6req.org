[[/u/target03][u/target03]] has it absulutely nailed. Work out what your PP is like (canon doesn't say that much so you got leeway). Then see how her strengths contriute to the trio and how her weakness cause problems as the three navigate your plot.

Though because she's in a different house, the interaction between the three is much more lmited. A twist would be that she wants to keep in with Malfoy, so her friendship with H & R is kept secret. Trouble is, that limits their interaction even more so it turns into a duo-plus-one, rather than a trio.
