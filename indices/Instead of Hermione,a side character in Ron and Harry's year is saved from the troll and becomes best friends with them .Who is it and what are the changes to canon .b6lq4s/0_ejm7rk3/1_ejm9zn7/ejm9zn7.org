  It's pretty interesting, and would also change the Gryffindor house as a whole.

  For example, canon Lavender is best friend with Parvati, what happens if she is with Ron and Harry? Parvati becomes closer to Hermione? And maybe her sister for the whole studious thing?

  For the relation sub plot, could be interesting but the begining may need to change. Canon Ron kissed Lavender in a moment of glory, but also because of what Ginny said about never kissing a girl. I can see him do it to a "random" girl, but not to his best friend/ member of the trio. If it was the case, the break up (if it happens) would be way harder, putting the whole friendship in danger.
