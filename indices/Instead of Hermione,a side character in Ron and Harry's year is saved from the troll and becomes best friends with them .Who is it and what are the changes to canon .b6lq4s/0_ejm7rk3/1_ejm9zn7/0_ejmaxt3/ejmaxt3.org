Yeah, maybe the fight with Parvati that got Lavender crying in the bathroom during the troll attack was because Lavender was bullying/excluding Hermione and Parvati wasn't having it? I think Parvati and Hermione as friends could be really interesting! They have some things in common. I kind of saw Lavender as being still friends with Parvati and others but only casually, but I can see them being hostile/distant towards each other, too.

For the romance, maybe it's Lavender who kisses Ron? I see one of her flaws being recklessness-- she's a Gryffindor, after all, and she's not really afraid of social risks. Since Lavender's partially a blank slate, I think she could be characterized to believably do something like that, especially if there's a buildup of them awkwardly flirting with each other and having romantic tension.

Alternatively, the "random" girl Ron kisses and temporarily dates could be Hermione (he doesn't know her so well in this AU). I don't know if she'd be up for it, though, and she might already be with Viktor Krum at that point!
