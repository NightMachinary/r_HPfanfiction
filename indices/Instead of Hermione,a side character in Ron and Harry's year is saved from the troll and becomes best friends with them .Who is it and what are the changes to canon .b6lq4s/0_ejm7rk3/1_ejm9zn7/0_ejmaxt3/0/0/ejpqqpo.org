That might work! They never had chemistry in canon, but you could write it so that they do. I mean, there's such a small cast of characters to choose from (there are only three mentioned Gryffindor girls in Ron's year, right?). There's not a lot of freedom to stray from canon. But this is fanfic! You could really pick anyone as his date, older, younger, or from another house, as long as it's not too unfeasible. Heh, maybe Romilda Vane! He could have the fling with Dean, Seamus, or a guy from another house/year, too, if you feel like making him bi. And OCs are always an option.
