In that case, maybe Parvati? She doesn't have the "history" Ron would have with Hermione or a rival like Krum. Also, in this scenario Harry would probably not have gone with Parvati to the Christmas Ball, Ron taking Padma so probably a plus (and even if he did, probably a better date without the jalousy brooding he did in Canon).
