It's Lavender! Lavender doesn't get enough love. She's crying in the bathroom because she got into a fight with Parvati (that's the gryffindor twin, right?) or something. She's alright at magic and at school in general, and has lived a decent upper-middle class lifestyle as a pureblood, though not a pureblood from any famous family. Let's say her family's not blood traitors like Ron's, but are socially liberal about muggleborns in a rich person way. She fills Hermione's place pretty well because whereas in the first book Hermione was a voice of caution/reason because she followed rules and had book smarts, Lavender is a voice of caution/reason because she's rightly afraid of three-headed dogs and has a pureblood education and social smarts.

About social smarts-- Lavender, the way I picture her in this AU, isn't like a fanon Slytherin character where she was raised for politicking and "makes alliances" and "networks" with intention. I figure she's more like a real-life sociable teenager/tween. She talks to a lot of people and has a lot of friends but not very many close ones except for Ron and Harry. Maybe she finds out about Nicholas Flamel because an older student is doing a research project on him for their Potions or History of Magic class or something. I can't imagine he's a very obscure historical figure. Hermione and Harry didn't know about him because they were raised Muggle, and Ron didn't know because he's not very academic, and is also eleven.

I think having Lavender as a member of the Trio would be really interesting for interpersonal conflicts and to help us get to know the rest of the student body a little better. I can imagine her being in conflict with Harry and Ron for similar reasons to Hermione-- they're improper/slobs/boyish/unsociable in her eyes-- but also can see her getting into conflict with Harry because she loves fame and attention and he doesn't. She might be confused as to why he's rejecting the spotlight (much like Lockhart in book two), and might bond with Ron over envy towards Harry. She might grow to realize that not everyone loves attention and could later help Harry by drawing the attention to herself whenever he's uncomfortable with so many eyes on him. She might also give him some of the physical affection he never got with the Dursleys, just hugs and stuff that girls are more casual with than guys. This would be part of her reason for being in Gryffindor: she's unafraid of the spotlight. She might have a character arc about learning not to put so much stock in societal expectations, but she would still keep her femininity, her love of makeup, clothes, and gossip, and so on. That's just who she is!

I think it would be a good idea to keep the subplot where she dates Ron. It would be a lot bigger of a thing since they would be close friends already, and it would hurt them both a lot more when it broke up, but I like the idea in canon of it being an immature relationship that eventually fails. It could make their friendships with Harry and each other pretty awkward, but learning to get past that and still be friends would be an interesting development in their relationships. It might happen earlier, in fourth or fifth year, as they both discover their sexuality and so on. I don't know, I just like Lavender and the more I think about it the more I feel like she would be really good friends with Harry and Ron!
