Yeah, I like the idea of divination working somewhat reliably, at least on a small scale, but it seems like it could get overpowered really quickly. Maybe a small talent in divination from Lavender would help her fill Hermione's role of 'the knowledgeable one' better, though! Divination really does fit with her personality, so I'd hate to see it go from the story entirely. And though I can't really imagine exactly how it would go, I do think her effect on Harry's and Ron's personalities (and theirs on hers) would be cool to see.
