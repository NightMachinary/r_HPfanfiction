Lavender would be a good option for an author who is comfortable using divination more, someone who is superstitious but with folklore to back them up.

Lavender might also help bolster Harry, getting him to open up more and brood less, we could see a friendlier and more sociable Harry. Lavander seems like someone who is optimistic, and that can work well with Harry and Ron's dark humor, to help brighten the mood instead of just letting them be snitty and sarcastic.

I think Ron and Lavender could have either still dated, or having known Ron for longer, and more intimately maybe Lavender would realize that he's not really the kind of guy who would like her over exuberance in the end, but can tolerate it from a friend.
