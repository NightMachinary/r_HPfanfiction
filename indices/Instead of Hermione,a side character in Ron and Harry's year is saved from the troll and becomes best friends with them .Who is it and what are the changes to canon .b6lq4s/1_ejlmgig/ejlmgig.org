Not an easy question. People tend to overestimate Hermione, as is already happening in this thread. A lot of the fanon view on her character is shaped by the last two books, which took away a lot of Harry's initiative leaving him only to act of other's(often Hermione's) direction.

This question really requires not just discussing the characters but also their place within the narrative. Hermione is the one who knows things and reads things. This is who she is as a character but also how she's used by the author. Which means without her other things would have to happen. Harry and Ron would have to do some of the leg work, which isn't interesting story telling. "Ron and Harry spent the afternoon reading quietly." doesn't make for a good book. Much better to have someone to drop the knowledge bomb so Harry can get to work.

So if I were replacing Hermione I'd definitely pick someone older, 2-3 years. None of the characters we know fit the bill so it'd be an OC. I wouldn't make them the 'trio' like in canon, rather just good friends but that don't spend all their time as a group.

Having someone older and more learned, but still in their confidence would fulfill the Hermione shaped plot device, but still give the stage to Harry and Ron to get shit done. The change to canon would be that Harry is never diminished from the plucky hero role.
