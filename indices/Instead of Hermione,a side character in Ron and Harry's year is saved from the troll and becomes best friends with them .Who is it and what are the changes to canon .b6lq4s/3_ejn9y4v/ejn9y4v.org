I don't like this idea (I am usually roughly pro-canon), but I would really like to see something better for Lavender. As much as everybody raves how pro-feminist Hermione is, most Rowling's girls are the most stereotypical ones possible, sometimes really hard to swallow. Ginny is one glorious example (whose only purpose of being is to be a future wife for Harry), but Lavender and Paravati are other. Given they girls, of course they are stupid, of course they fall for Divination, and of course, they don't talk about anything else than boys and clothes. Yes, she was in DA (even in the second DA under Carrows), and yes she was the only girl aside from Hermione who fought Blast-Ended Skrewts in the December of their fourth year, but nothing serious.

Gossip is almost the same as espionage, if you think about it. (And yes Northumbrian's Ginny is also a way better than in canon).
