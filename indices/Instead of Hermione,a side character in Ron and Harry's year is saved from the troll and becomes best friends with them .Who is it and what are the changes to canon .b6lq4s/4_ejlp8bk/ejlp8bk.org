I like this idea as a good clean way to diverge from canon, if that's your desire.

For me, to do thia right, you'd have to go one step back and give a reason for why someone other than Hermione was caught out alone that night. Like, instead of levitating his feather did Ron shoot it across the room and jab someone in the eye, thus a needed trip to the hospital wing. Or did Harry set someone's robes alight, necessitating a last minute change of clothes?

Then you could literally sub anyone in. A Ravenclaw NPC if you want to keep a pseudo-genius thing going for the third member. But maybe twist it to a cold emotionless logic so the group are more calculating. Maybe leads to them seeing through the Sirius at the Ministry ploy and keeping him alive...

Or use it as an easy transition to promote your favourite Harry love interest and give our boy some sugar.

I think whatever is done, it needs to chamge the way the group thinks and responds to all the challenges put in front of them for the remainder of the series though. A strong personality to guide the pair in a completely new direction could be great fun.
