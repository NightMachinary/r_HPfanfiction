There's an amazingly written fanfiction with the pairing of Lily Luna/Sirius called Time Spiral.

She goes back in time, meets everyone in hogwarts, lives there for almost a year and comes back to her time where sirius is dead.

So it's not exactly what you're looking for but it's similar and the writing as well as story itself are amazing. I'm not into this pairing at all, and I don't read marauder gen stories but this one is so good I couldn't help but recommend.
