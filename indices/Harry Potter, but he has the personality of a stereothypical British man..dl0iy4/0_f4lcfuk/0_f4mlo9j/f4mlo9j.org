Ahhh.. .yes... How we call them: "The Manchester Carpenters".

Basically the working class brits who travel to my city to get insanely drunk on cheap beer.

They are some of the most reviled creatures that have ever dared to stain the streets of my city.

Unfortunately, I'm not competent enough in their vernacular to properly imitate their speech. And it is very peculiar.
