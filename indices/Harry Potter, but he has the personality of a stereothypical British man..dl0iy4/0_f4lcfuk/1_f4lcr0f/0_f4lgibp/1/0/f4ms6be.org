Potter, I do /not/ for one moment believe that this is tincture of wormwood you have prepared because after five years of complete indifference to the art you are currently so /stunningly/ devoted to doing well in your Potions N.E.W.T.! Potter! You are hallucinating, /put your wand down/! And the absinthe bottle. If you can work out where the door actually is we are going to the Headmaster and perhaps /this/ time we can finally see the back of you. Try to sing and it will be the last thing you ever do.
