[[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16280423][The difference is usually within 200 calories any higher than that and you will start to see health issues outside of weight]]

I myself thought that my metabolism was failing as I got older but when I started counting my calories I lost 35lbs (169-134) and have kept it off for over a couple years. I was drinking an extra 70k a year by drinking regular soda instead of diet and it showed. Check out [[/r/loseit]] calculate your Total daily energy expenditure (or TDEE) eat less than that and you will lose weight I promise! I would be happy to help you with any questions, encouragement and tips if you need any! The cool part about a Calorie In Calorie Out (CICO) diet is you can eat anything you want as long as you budget it against your TDEE. Weigh every bit of food and always guess higher for consumption and lower (like way way way lower) for exercise. Log it and watch the weight fall off! Zero exercise is needed! I worked my ass off for abs in the gym in high school (6 days a week 1 hour a day) and could never get them, started dieting and I have them without working out. The expression Abs are made in the kitchen is 100 percent true

You've got this! Just be honest and understand that a bad/cheat day doesn't undo work you have already put in!
