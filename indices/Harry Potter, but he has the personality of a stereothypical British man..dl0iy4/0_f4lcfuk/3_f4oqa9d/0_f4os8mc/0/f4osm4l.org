Yeah but a lot of us fellows have slow, I mean REALLY slow metabolism. Which, quite frankly, pisses me off as I'm a ninth grader, 5'6", about 175. Most of that is muscle or bone, however probably about a third is my 'fat'. This is irritating because it means I could work out and burn it off, however I'd probably have to spend 2 hours each day working towards that. Which isn't something I can manage currently.

Edit: 175 pounds, which is equivalent to 79.3 kilos
