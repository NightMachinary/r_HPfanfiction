The set up would be super simple. Vernon gets a promotion to Head of Sales for Scotland for Grunnings. They move to Glasgow. Harry gets involved in the street culture there, as a way to avoid going back to the house.

He turns up to Hogwarts able to weigh heroin by the eye (could lead to a funny scene in potions) and carrying a knife.

First time Malfoy tries to hassle him, Harry walks away. Corners Malfoy alone later that night and knocks his teeth in.

Anytime anyone insults Slytherins he always says "at least they don't support celtic".
