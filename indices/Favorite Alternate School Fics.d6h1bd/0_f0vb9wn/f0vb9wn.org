While your flair is listed as discussion, the body of your post seems to indicate that you are looking for requests. So I'll give you a couple.

Well, a commonly recommended one is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by the Santi) Harry starts off in Hogwarts but after a few months he decides to transfer to Durmstrang and save for the first couple chapters the work is set in Durmstrang. I really liked how the author established the culture of Durmstrang. Fantastic world building.

While it takes place in Hogwarts, linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) makes Hogwarts (and its students) barely recognizable as both the curriculum and the student body are much more competitive and combative. It's basically Ender's Game adapted for Harry Potter. I enjoyed it immensely.
