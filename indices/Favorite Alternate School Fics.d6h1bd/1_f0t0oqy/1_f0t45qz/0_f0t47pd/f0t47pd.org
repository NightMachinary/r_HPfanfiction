  With the end of fourth year Voldamort has returned, but Harry isn't waiting for him to make the first move. He has found a way to maybe put the bastard in his grave for good. Snow point Academy, hidden in the frozen reaches of the Antarctic Ocean is nothing like Hogwarts, but that seems to be just what harrys going to need to survive.
