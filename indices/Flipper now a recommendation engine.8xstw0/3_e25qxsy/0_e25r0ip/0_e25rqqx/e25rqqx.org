I expand the possible tag list, click the tag to add. Ends up looking like that - [[https://i.imgur.com/6BbJ4rz.png]]

Another thing - the Discord Invite is dead.

And one more thing the application jumps to the other part of recommendation list instead of opening fic when I try to open to open [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5971274/1/Conlaodh-s-Song]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/1/0800-Rent-A-Hero]] I suspected the special signs being at work, but the Prisoner's Cipher opened for example. The upvoting/downvoting fics also ends up in jump through the list.
