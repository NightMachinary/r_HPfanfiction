Well, depends on a few things, if you want dark and evil, look no further than linkffn(Harry Potter and the Homecoming). Its a superb series with Harry's descent to evil, with fantastic plot and absurdly gory stuff. There are a couple of scenes that I had to skim over to be sick-level of gory. Extremely well written, though it starts a little slow. I love the author and his works, so I'm might be biased, but if you do enjoy it, check his other fics, they have really interesting premises.

For just a dark Slytherin, but not evil, there are 2 series that come to mind, though they are famous and very similar to one another. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) and linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes) from Sarcasm and Slytherin series.

All of these three series(though POS is a single fic, it should cover all years, or at least the end of fourth book, though we are only halfway year 3) are over 200k words, and POS is a bit massive.

If just want a dark Harry, and would accept a non slytherin one, check linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky). Its canon through year 5, with massive divergence after. Its my favourite fic besides Grow Young with Me.
