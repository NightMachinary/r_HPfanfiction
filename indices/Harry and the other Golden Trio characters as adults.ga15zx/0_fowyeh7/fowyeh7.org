[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13524866/1/Flowers-for-Hermione][Flowers-for-Hermione]] I have never been this excited over a fic. It is a slice of life Harmony WIP and is full of fluff. I initially hesitated to read it due to the angst tag but once I decided to give it a try I could not stop. I was up till 4 am reading it.
