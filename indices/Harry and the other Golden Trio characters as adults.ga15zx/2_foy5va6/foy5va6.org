Most Starfox5 fics are about competent Trio slightly more powerful than canon, often as adults. For example Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died) is entirely AU with the main characters all young adults. My favorite, Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) has the first chapter in second year with the main canon divergence, then covers the Hogwarts years relatively quickly just mentioning what's different and then most of it is with the Trio as adults, Harry and Ron's adventures as aurors, Hermione's heists, and politics.
