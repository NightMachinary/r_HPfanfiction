[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8106168/1/Weres-Harry][Weres Harry?]] is pretty good. WIP that updates pretty infrequently, unfortunately. Pairings are mentioned but not major plot points.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
