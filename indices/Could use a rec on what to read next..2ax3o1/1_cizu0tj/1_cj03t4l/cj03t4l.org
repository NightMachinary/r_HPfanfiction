Just a general warning to people on "Innocent", it's super slow. Suuuuper fucking slow. Like I was reading the fic, 200k words in, and I was wondering when the fuck Harry would get to Hogwarts. Not really Harry centric, it goes deep into other characters, changing viewpoints often.

If you don't mind slow fics that center on raising a young Harry, I would definitely recommend it. I personally couldn't get past 250k words unfortunately.
