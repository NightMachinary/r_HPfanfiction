The Denarian series does a fantastic job of introducing the few elements of the Dresden Files that it utilizes (even though Shezza noticeably improves as an author throughout Denarian Renegade).

My favorite part about the story is that while it starts somewhat predictably with abuse and neglect that normally turns me off, Harry goes on not to be the typical Dark!Harry, but a character who struggles to define and deny his own humanity. Definitely on my list of "must reads".
