Thanks for the suggestions, I've read A Study in Magic before and really enjoyed it. I feel like I've seen a Well Groomed Mind, but I haven't read too much on Ao3, so I will give it a read for sure. I've passed up reading a Prince of the Dark Kingdom a few times, but I guess I should give it a try as I think it has been rec'ed several times on here.
