A Well Groomed Mind is also on ffnet, under the same name I think. Prince is a bit of a heavy read so I don't think it's too bad that you passed it up a few times.

Someone else in this thread mentioned Death of Today and yes it does say slash in the summary but it's not really....sexual, if you know what I mean. Harry is mostly Asexual in it, to be honest. That's why I dropped it since that wasn't what I was into at the time but I am going to pick it up again eventually.
