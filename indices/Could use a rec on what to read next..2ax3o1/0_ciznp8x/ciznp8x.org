Well....I am actually following two out of your list. So....

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] by Mizuni-Sama is one that has little to no romance and is Harry-centric..in a way. It's an AU where Voldemort has control over wizarding britain and Harry was going to keep out of it until his parents were killed and he was sent to his relative's. Now Voldemort considers him an Apprentice and he keeps losing himself. The gap between updates are long but she puts out massive chapters so it's fine.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/21003][The Well Groomed Mind]] series is Harry centric with no romance I can see. Harry finds out Dumbledore has been manipulating his personality and does something about it. It's Harry's POV for the most part.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/441560][Name Confused]], though not exactly in your criteria, is a Sherlock/HP crossover with Harry [now in his thirties, post Battle of Hogwarts], works for Mycroft Holmes as his anonymous assistant/bodyguard/magic liasion. On that same note, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7578572/1/A-Study-in-Magic][A Study in Magic]] is a very excellent HP/Sherlock crossover where Harry is raised by John and Sherlock. Super long and the sequel is still being updated. Very gen.

Everything else I like is slash/abandoned/really short. /shrug. [[http://fffn.darklordpotter.net/][This tool]] is super useful for filtering out ficts you like and don't like. Consider hunting through AO3 with their filters enabled and also look up archives outside of ffnet. There is a good list linked in the sidebar along with fict recs from tv tropes.
