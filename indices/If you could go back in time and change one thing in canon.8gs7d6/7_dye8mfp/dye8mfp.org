I would add in some positively overt LGBT characters sprinkled through the story. Maybe Harry notes random same-sex couples at the Yule Ball, maybe he gets to know a trans character in his House. Maybe one of the mentioned Order members is mentioned as being a man with a husband, or a woman with a wife!

These are ways to do this positively and naturally, and without having to change the main casts sexualities away from seeming straightness (like some people here comment about they don't like seeing happen in fanfictions).
