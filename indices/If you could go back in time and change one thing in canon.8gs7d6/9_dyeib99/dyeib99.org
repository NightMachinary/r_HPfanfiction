I'd make it so Hermione died against the troll in first year. (Just kidding lmao.)

In truth, something like, if Harry wasn't abused by the Dursley's and they were a loving family, I wonder what Harry would have been like. (Probably more emotionally stable, less anger, perhaps even a different house sorting, more confident perhaps) This doesn't mean he necessarily knows he's a wizard however, Petunia would love him in this scenario and wouldn't want him to be a "freak" or expose him to the dangers of the wizarding world (She knows her sister died from it)
