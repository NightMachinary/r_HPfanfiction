I would not let Ariana get assaulted, which would lead to Dumbledore being a happy confident bloke, Grindelwald would fall in love with said happy confident bloke, which would lead to them feeling that gay rights activism being a more pressing matter than becoming the Masters of Death or world domination, Grindelwald would use his talents to form a political career and Dumbledore would do research, after quite a while they would win acceptance and would decide to start a family, they would put a spell on all orphanages to alert them in case a magical child is left without someone to care for it, and beep beep, there would be one, Tom Marvolo Riddle would be his name and they would raise and love him as their own, which would lead to him becoming a super cool nice bloke, who would become a teacher and mentor for young Severus who would therefore develop some nice self esteem and not be miserable and everyone would love and live happily ever after.

....

If everyone would be like me, there would be no stories, everyone would just be happy and loved.
