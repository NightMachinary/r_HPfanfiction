I just read through the first chapter, and I really liked it so far. I've been avoiding this for reasons I cannot fathom, and it's probably the best opening to a fic I've read in a long while.

It was a bit heavy on the exposition, but I enjoyed your changes so I didn't particularly mind. I still feel it would have been better if the exposition was revealed a bit more subtly.

I had one question though:

#+begin_quote
  ...so there were five boys and five girls accepted every year with no deviation.
#+end_quote

This was confusing me for a while. Don't you mean twenty each?
