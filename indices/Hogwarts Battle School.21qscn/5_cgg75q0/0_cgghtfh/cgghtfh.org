Glad you finally got to start it!

To be honest, I understand the hesitation. Looking back, I made several mistakes in OBWL. Lots of plotting errors that led to an increasingly convoluted plot line. I'm proud of sections of that story, but there are many things I would have changed.

In contrast, I feel that I have HBS more in control and have a very specific idea of where to go with it. But I'm glad you overlooked some of the crazier aspects of HBS to give it a chance.
