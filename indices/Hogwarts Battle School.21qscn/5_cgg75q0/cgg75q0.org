To be honest, I've been avoiding the story. I've seen it on DLP and on various lists, but nothing really caught my eye, despite loving both HP and EG. Probably had something to do with "The Other Boy Who Lived", which I never finished (nothing particularly wrong with it, it's just I found the whole tower/james debacle to contrived as fuck).

Going through it now though, I'm surprised to say that I'm enjoying it. The idea is pretty convoluted, but maybe that's what I'm looking for after 10 years of reading fanfiction. Something new, original, and different from everything else. I'll definitely be finishing this one.
