Do it do it do it do it do it DO IT.

Seriously, the movie does a ton of things right. In fact, I would say that it's probably /the best/ movie you could make out of the Ender's Game book.

That said, the book is so much better. It's more detailed, battle school is actually really interesting. The plot makes more sense, the characters feel more real. All those little side characters in the movie that don't really seem important? Bean, Petra, Ali? They're much more fleshed out in the book, and you come to understand why they're highlighted in the movie.
