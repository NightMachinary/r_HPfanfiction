I've my doubts about reading this fanfic, and I would apreciate if you could answer my questions. I read somewhere, probably in a comment here on [[/r/HPfanfiction]], that you story it is similar to the Ender's Game story. Thats good cause I really enjoy that film (I want to read the books now).

Actually I only have one question, but for 4 characters. What can you tell me about the four principal characters in your story Harry, Hermione, Ron and Snape? (well, I think they are the principals, but I am not sure because so far I only read the summary of your fanfic)
