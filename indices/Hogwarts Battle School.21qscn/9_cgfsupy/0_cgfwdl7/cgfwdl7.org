It is inspired (and at times borrows heavily) from Ender's Game. I would urge you to read the books as I feel they're far more entertaining than the movie.

- Harry - a gifted Slytherin with a penchant for dueling. As each battle becomes more challenging, Harry must find it within himself to find the will to go forward and the ingenuity to keep winning

- Hermione - Intelligent but stubborn, Hermione drives the Gryffindors forward with her own unique brand of magic. She is one of the few that rival Harry's skill in the battle room

- Snape - the headmaster of Hogwarts, Snape is merciless in his approach to cultivate the students into fighting machines. To what end is not yet known...

- Ron - Ron is a very minor character in this story
