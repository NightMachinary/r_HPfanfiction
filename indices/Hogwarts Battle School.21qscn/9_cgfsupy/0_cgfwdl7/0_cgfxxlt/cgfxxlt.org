Wow, that sounds awesome.

I don't like Ron, so being a very minor character is okay with me :3 Hermione is Harry rival? Not usually what I read, but this looks interesting. I can either like or hate Snape, it all depends on how the author writes him.

Thanks for answer the questions, I will give your fanfic a try, and I think I will enjoy it :)

The books are on my list "What I Have To Read This Year", but right now I don't have time to read anything :/
