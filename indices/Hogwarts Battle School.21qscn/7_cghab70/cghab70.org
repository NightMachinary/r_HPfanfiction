One of the best HP stories still updating; between this story and OBWL, I've probably recommended it twenty times in the sub.

My only quibble is that the story has seemed a bit adrift the past few chapters. Perhaps it's the nature of the serial publication format, and I suspect this will change in a chapter or so as the TWT gets underway, but there hasn't been a very strong sense of direction of late.
