Thank you! And it does have a different pacing than Book 1. It's a bit of a different landscape. By Chapter 5 of Book 1, you already have the villains and the main conflict for that year, but since we're walking over somewhat familiar territory, there's a sense of familiarity that takes away some of the urgency and surprise.

But I expect it will pick up ;)
