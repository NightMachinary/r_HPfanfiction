As much as I love the idea, something like this would be difficult to do seeing as there isn't much infirmarion available on Dumbledore's time at Hogwarts. All we know is that he was friends with Elphias Doge, and that he excelled in his studies.

Plus, there's literally nothing for Harry to do during his time there. He's already learnt everything, and there isn't a man who's constantly trying to murder him, so he needs something to do during his time there.

Time travel fics usually have Harry try to prevent the Wizarding Wars from happening. Either by steering Tom in the right direction (if it's during Tom's time at Hogwarts), or straight up telling Dumbledore everything.

You can't really do that, though if Dumbledore's a literal child attending his first year of Magic School. Which, now that I think about it, could make for a crack fic where Harry tries desperately to warn Dumbledore, but fails horribly because no person in their right mind would believe his perposturous story.

This idea popped into my head once, and I tried to write it, but there just wasn't enough information. The plot wasn't interesting because there wasn't really one to begin with. Couldn't get past the Sorting Ceremony.

Also, this completely unrelated, but I'm still annoyed Harry was born 99 years after Dumbledore, and not just a century.
