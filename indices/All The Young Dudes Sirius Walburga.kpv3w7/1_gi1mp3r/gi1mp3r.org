I adored the writing in All the Young Dudes but couldn't finish it. When the bad stuff starts happening to the characters, I had to stop. This is one of the reasons why I don't gravitate toward Marauders fics (unless they're super AU); it's because you know bad shit is gonna go down sooner or later to them.
