This fic does a really great job at giving us a sense of why Sirius hated his family so much. They're downright terrifying, and Sirius loses almost everything before coming back to his horrific childhood home.

Enjoy reading the rest of the story!! I was in a depressive funk for a week afterward because I was so sad it ended, and I still get teary listening to Bowie because I'm a sap lmao. Also, there is a very short fic "Out of the Blue" that is a sort of epilogue that you MUST read after you are done!
