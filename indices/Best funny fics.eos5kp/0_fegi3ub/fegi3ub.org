Is that because you dislike them, or just because you're familiar with them?

I'll mention linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629]]) since no-one else has yet.

  /Dear Professor Snape,/

  /I know you do not like to be bothered during the summer holidays, but I thought I would/

  Harry crumpled up the note and started over.

  /Dear Professor Snape,/

  /I achieved an Outstanding on my Potions OWL, as instructed. I hope your summer is/

  Harry tore that one in half. Hedwig, sitting on her perch, hooted at him.

  “I'm working on a letter for Professor Snape, Hedwig. I'll have it for you in a minute.”

  /Dear Professor Snape,/

  /How are you? I am fine. I hope you are recovered. I was pleased to receive my OWL results and look forward to seeing you at Hogwarts/

  Harry studied that one, then crumpled it up too. Hedwig, bored, soared out the window.

  /Dear Evil Nose,/

  /I got an Outstanding on my potions OWL, so you're stuck with me. Everyone has been asking me how I am, and I look forward to returning to school so you can tell me I'm being an idiot. I've been trying to figure out what to put in a letter to you for an hour and this is sadly my best attempt, which I am now going to ritually burn./

  /My last myrtle potion demonstrated that if you're overenthusiastic about the tapping it explodes amusingly on the unwitting student./

  /Harry/

  Harry crumpled it into a ball and threw it out the window, where Hedwig caught it and flew away.

  Harry made a noise approximately like ‘gnk.'
