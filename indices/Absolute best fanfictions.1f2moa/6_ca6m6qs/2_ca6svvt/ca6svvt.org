Glad to see someone else who doesn't like HPMOR. What are your reasons?

Those fics sound great. I'm partial to back-to-age-eleven fics if done well, so I'm looking forward to reading that.

I've read The Best Revenge, somehow I didn't love it. Harry felt off. But it's decent, I'll give you that.

If you have more, please let me know, I'd love to check them out.
