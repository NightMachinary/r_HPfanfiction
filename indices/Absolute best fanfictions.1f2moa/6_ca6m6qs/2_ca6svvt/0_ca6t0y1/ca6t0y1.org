I'm on my phone so still can't follow through on further recs, sorry.

I found it too far ooc for me. OOC Harry I can deal with. OOC Hermione I can deal with. OOC Quirrell?? gtfo. Also the time turning was stupid. And the war competition thing. And just about all of it. Just really rubbed me the wrong way I guess.

Such a waste of an excellent premise in scientific!Harry. So disappointing.

I'm a fan of back to eleven fics too so if you have any recs yourself... :)
