I had mixed feelings about HPMoR, I enjoyed it a lot, but it definitely had major issues (long experience reading fanfic has left me capable of enjoying bad fics with redeeming features), mostly how god damned annoying and self righteous Harry could be, and the snapping fingers thing really came across as a combination of "LOL im so random" and the kind of cult of personality thing that often builds up around characters that the author loves too much. However, I really don't get how you could say Quirrell was out of character. We just don't know anything about Quirrell, since in canon he's possessed, and putting on an extensive act. Here he's also presumably possessed, and is putting on a different act, which may well be more true to Tom Riddle's personality than it is to Quirrell's.
