I know this is an old thread, but I stumbled across it by looking through the top posts of this sub, so I feel like I need to contribute just in case someone else finds this in 2 months...

Anyway, I really enjoy the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8670912/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Gift-of-Memories][Harry Potter and the Gift of Memories]] series. It's a book-by-book retelling of Harry Potter's life, but with the "twist" being that he has an eidetic memory and thus is more grown up, knew he was a wizard from an early age, etc. Each book is it's own story on fanfiction.net, and so far it's just the first year that's complete. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9196576/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Heir-of-Slytherin][Heir of Slytherin]], which is this universe's version of CoS, is still being updated pretty regularly.

Be warned, it has a couple of OC's, is intentionally a long-running Harem!Harry story, and occasionally the way it's written has a few harry-sue moments, but all in all it's well-written and quite engaging
