I really wanted to like HPMoR, but I didn't.

There are some amazing ones in the DLP C2 which I think some people already linked for you - /Memorium/, /Intoxication/ and /Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time/ come to mind.

Anyway, mine - probably not necessarily the best of the best as such, but more like fics that had a real emotional effect on me - are:

Summaries: BtDL:

  Book 1. Follow Harry and Dumbledore as they descend into the depths of Old Magic seeking power and redemption in equal measure. En route they encounter ancient enchantments, a heliopath and an evil that could burn the world.

  Book 2. As the Second War begins, Voldemort becomes obsessed with harnessing the realm of Old Magic to his own ends. Meanwhile, Harry has to contend with the Ministry, ancient foes and the machinations of a world he barely understands.

Intriguing characterisations of characters we should all be sick of by now, amazing contextualisation of pagan folklore into the Wizarding world, and several revelations that made my jaw drop IRL.

I can't find a summary for this. Sorry. It follows the Marauders and, to a lesser extent, Lily, from their fifth year through to Peter's joining the Death Eaters. I know there are far, far too many fics that do that, but this one's decent, honest.

Anyway. I wasn't a slash fan before I read this because I'd read some godawful Drarry at some point. However - this is a Remus/Sirius, by the way - the authors take real care in building up the relationships between R/S and L/J while also making the war feel real, as well as making Peter's betrayal a believable action while portraying him fairly sympathetically. Both the comic and serious parts of this fic - one of the few well-written dramedies of fic - are endlessly quotable and they really do resonate - with me at least.

  /I whirled through classes. Fluctuated. I breathed brightness. I spoke laughter. I wouldn't change a thing./ Lavender Brown is /alive/.

There was a thread on this recently IIRC. It's a Lavendercentric (as you can probably tell) one-shot, and teh tarik does really like her description, so it might not appeal to everyone. However, I loved it - this, right here, in my opinion is the redemption of Lavender Brown in fanfiction. I've read it several times, and it always hits me right in the feels every single time.
