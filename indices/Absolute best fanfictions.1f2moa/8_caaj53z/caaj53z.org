[[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunset over Britain]] and it's sequel Sunrise over Britain were both excellent, it's a long read (over 1mil words) but i thoroughly enjoyed it. The author (Bobmin) also has some other great stories on that site that I would highly reccomend, Mutant Storm was a fun read and over on FanFiction.net his HP/Dragon Riders of Pern X-Over stories were great.
