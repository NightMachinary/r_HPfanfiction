Joe6991. If you are looking for the absolute best HP Fanfiction, you cannot simply say anything but one of Joe's masterpieces. For the love of god, his Hero Trilogy is HP/GW and DarkLordPotter loves it! That must count for something.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3994212/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-the-Hero][Sword of the Hero]]
- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4042356/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Defiance-of-the-Hero][Defiance of the Hero]]
- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4413991/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Soul-of-the-Hero][Soul of the Hero]] This trilogy clocks in over 1,000,000 words, but it's worth every second of the read. It reads like King's Dark Tower series, something that is a huge plus.

Joe's other good fic is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][The Wastelands of Time]] and it's followup [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6325846/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Heartlands-of-Time][Heartlands of Time]]. These are both amazing, but Heartlands isn't complete and it's been some time since last update. These are Harry/Fleur, and reads just as good as the Trilogy. Fiction at it's finest!
