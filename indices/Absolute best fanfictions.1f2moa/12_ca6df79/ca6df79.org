I love [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=19708][/The Apple Tree/ by Philo]] and have recommended it often. It was written after The Goblet of Fire, and departs from canon there, but it takes place in Harry's seventh year. That has been a bit hard for some people to catch onto, but now you've been warned you'll have no trouble.

It is slash, HP/SS, though Snape is unaware of Harry's identity. Harry has grown, secretly developing his special powers and his sense of self in the unchronicled years. Entering his seventh year, he is master of his fate and has a plan. And that is my favorite version of Harry, wised-up and proactive.

Under Harry's influence, other characters develop differently from canon. I absolutely swoon over this Neville, and Draco is well done, too.

And also, this story line acknowledges the strengths of the muggle world, which I personally enjoy, though I know not everyone likes their magical fanfic laced with the mundane.
