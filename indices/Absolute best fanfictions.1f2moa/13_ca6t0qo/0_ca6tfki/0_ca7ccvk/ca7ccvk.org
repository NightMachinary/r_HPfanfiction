Well to start off with it's epic. Not just in length where it clocks in at 88 chapters and over a million words and growing, but the story is as well. It has everything one could possibly want. It's action packed, and lots of intrigue and romance. The characterizations are great with plenty of drama and smart writing. The story is H/HR (my absolute favorite!) and Hermione is brilliant as always but as with everything in the story believably so without using her knowledge as a deus ex machina. Harry is wonderful and very powerful but with all of his new found power come smarter tougher and more interesting enemies. It hits all of the favorite tropes with unique and interesting spins and adds mind boggling amounts of new plot hooks and twists of his own. The scenes are described beautifully and the dialogue is great as well. The fic is pretty much an entire remake of book 6 and if I have anything at all bad to say of the story it's that once you finally catch up to the latest chapter you have to wait painfully and expectantly for the next to come out. However you can still rest assured that the next chapter will come out as he updates regularly if not as frequently as his addicts might hope. I even love his introductions which set the mouth watering for what is to come and his end of chapter author notes are amazing as well because you can see the intelligence and the attention to detail that goes into writing his fic... EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED! I know this post is very rambly and disjointed but I really love this fic and know everyone else who reads it will too so instead of taking my word for it judge it for yourself, just go to fanfiction.net or portkey.org (he updates chapters ahead of time on portkey) and look up Harry Potter and the Fifth Element. You'll be glad you did!
