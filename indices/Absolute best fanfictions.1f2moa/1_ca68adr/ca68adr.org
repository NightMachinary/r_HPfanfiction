My favorite fanfic is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/A-Stranger-in-an-Unholy-Land][A Stranger in an Unholy Land]]. Basically, Harry gets transported into an alternate universe where he is a Death Eater. It's nicely written, although I will admit there are some of the usual cliches (I still enjoyed it despite them though). There isn't much involving pairings. There is some manipulative!Dumbledore, but it's not anti-Dumbledore in the same way that HPMOR is. Although that fanfic is finished, it is part of a trilogy where the 2nd part stopped after 7 chapters (FF.net only has 4, but there are 7 total). The first one has a solid ending though and I'd highly recommend it! To warn you now, the first chapter starts off rather slow and Harry is with the Dursleys (this was written after OotP as a possible "6th book"), but I really recommend trying to read through the 3rd chapter before giving it up because the action really gets exciting after that.

Another fanfic I love is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1248431/1/Promises-Unbroken][Promises Unbroken]], it's part of a trilogy that is complete. I haven't read all of the last part yet (since I've been too busy with school the last few years to read fanfiction), but I've reread the other parts several times because I really liked it. Sirius is the main character though, with more focus on him and the Marauders as adults than Harry and co (although they actually have some focus too).

Finally, my 3rd favorite would probably be [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Nightmares of Future's Past]]. It's still in-progress and the author is currently writing a very long Naruto fanfic too (I believe he'll write a chapter for one, then switch to the other), so updates come very slowly- maybe once a year. The chapters are /very/ long though. I like both of the fics by that author, very nicely written. He's more focused on pairings though to warn you (HarryxGinny is there pretty early on, plus some of the other main ones).

I also really enjoyed [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/Realizations][Realizations]], it doesn't have a real plot but it's nicely written and more introspective in a way. Unfortunately it was abandoned some years ago though. If it hadn't been discontinued it might be one of my favorites, but since it leaves you hanging it's kind of frustrating.

If you haven't read these, hopefully you'll enjoy them if you get a chance! We may have somewhat similar tastes- I tried both HPMOR and In Blood Only and I didn't really like them. I'll have to check out the others that you loved though since I haven't read those myself :)
