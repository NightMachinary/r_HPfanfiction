I haven't read any of those but Nightmares, so thanks! As to Nightmares, I'm making my way through it, but it doesn't feel /compelling/ like some of the others, and the portrayals are a bit off, so I'm kind of forcing myself to read it because a lot of people have recommended it. I like the premise, though.

Will check out the others, they look intriguing.
