Thanks! I've read the Mine series and found that I don't really have a taste for caretaker-of-childversion![character] fics, but that notwithstanding it was quite well written. A Different Fate is lovely, even though I didn't think I'd like it at first.

I'm usually not into crossovers, but I can give the last one a shot anyway. What's Hellraiser, though?
