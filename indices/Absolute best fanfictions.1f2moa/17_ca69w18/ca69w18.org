My favourite H/D fics: [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BW01.html][Beautiful World]] and [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BY01.html][Beneath You]] by Cinnamon; [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4842696/1/Reparations][Reperations]] and it's sequel [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5047623/1/][Foundations]] by Sara's Girl; and [[http://hp-mhealthfest.livejournal.com/9617.html][Remember Me]] by reikokatsura, which will break your heart.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/][Cauterize]] is a beautifully heart-breaking one-shot.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4113087/1/][A Different Fate]] by lordhellebore is a short AU where Voldemort's AK left Harry mentally disabled and the author handles the issue brilliantly and realistically. (I say that as someone who grew up with a disabled younger sister.)

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2301238/1/][Fizz]] by Kiki Cabou. /Summary: Harry has issues. Fortunately, he also has friends./ I think the summary says it all really.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1963825/1/][Mine]] and it's sequels (check the author page; there's several) by Gillian Middleton is a good Snape as Harry's father fic, and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4307359/1/][Harry's First Detention]] and it's sequel [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4437151/1/][Harry's New Home]] by kbinnz is Snape adopts Harry.

Also, not sure of your opinion on crossovers but [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/][Evil Be Thou My Good]] is a great crossover with Hellraiser, but all the Hellraiser elements are explained as it's from Harry's POV, so you needn't have seen the film (films? I haven't watched it/them) to understand this story.
