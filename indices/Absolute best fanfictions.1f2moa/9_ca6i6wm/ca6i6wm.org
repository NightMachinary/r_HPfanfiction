I love [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/1/Death-of-Today][Death of Today]] by Epic Solemnity. For me, what makes that fic so amazing is the world the author creates and the complexity of the characters. It has a LV/HP pairing, and the author did such a good job with it that I actually enjoyed the pairing, which normally I would find grotesque.

I also love the Sacrifices Arc by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave]]. This is another author who does a phenomenal job creating an intricate and beautiful world that both incorporates and adds to canon. Although the characters develop much more slowly than is normal in fanfics, I find the characterization to be all the more believable for it.
