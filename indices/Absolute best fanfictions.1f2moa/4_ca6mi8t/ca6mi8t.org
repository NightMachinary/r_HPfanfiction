My favourite fanfics of all time are the Alexandra Quick series by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%20fanfics%20of%20all%20time%20u/1374917/Inverarity][Inverarity]]. They take place in the American Wizarding World, feature entirely original characters, and are damn near professionally written. There are four completed books with a fifth in progress. His other story, [Hogwarts: Houses Divided] is also very good.

Another great story is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Brown Coat, Green Eyes]] It's a crossover between Harry Potter and Joss Whedon's Firely. Sounds strange, but its excellent. Other people have lots of praise for nonjon's other stories, but I don't prefer them.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backwards With Purpose]] is an great time-travel story in which Snape plays a sizable part. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Nightmares of Futures Past]] is another time-travel classic, though it is unfinished and the author sometimes goes years without updating. The Denarian series by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/524094/Shezza][Shezza]] is another fantastic crossover, this one between Harry Potter and the Dresden books. I've never read the Dresden books, but was still able to easily follow and enjoy this series.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3186836/1/Vox-Corporis][Vox Corporis]] by MissAnnThropic is my favorite Harry/Hermione story.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]] by Arsinoe de Blassenville is by far my favourite Snape-as-Harry's-Mentor story, and many of his other stories are also worth reading.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7413926/1/Chasing-The-Sun][Chasing the Sun]] is a superb Snape/Hermione story, by far the best I've read of that pairing.

This is of course by no means an exhaustive list. Check out the DLP C2 on Fanfiction.net, which several others have linked to. Another great tool for finding good stories is examining the favourite stories and authors lists of authors you already enjoy.
