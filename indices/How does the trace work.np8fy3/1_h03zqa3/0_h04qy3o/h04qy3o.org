Yeah, this about covers it. It's fairly consistent in canon. Some people assume there's holes in it because the likes of Arthur or Tonks cast spells near Harry, but it's likely they just got permission from the Ministry.

Though the Trace doesn't "perhaps" not know who cast the spell, canon states that it absolutely doesn't know.

From Dumbledore twice in HBP:

#+begin_quote
  “You are quite right --- they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator."

  “They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic."
#+end_quote

It should also be noted that the Trace, or some similar spell, can tell when a muggle has seen magic. The Ministry knows Dudley saw the Patronus. This is probably also used to help keep the Statute of Secrecy going.
