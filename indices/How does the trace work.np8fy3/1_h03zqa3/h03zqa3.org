The simplest explanation is that the Trace detects any magic cast within the vicinity of those under the age of seventeen. It's on the underaged person themselves.

I'm not sure if canon elaborates on how, exactly, the Trace is actually applied, but a common fanon-theory is that it's placed on the wand, though I doubt it. Underage magic prior to attending Hogwarts tends to be ignored by the Ministry, which is kind of silly considering the implications for the Statute of Secrecy.

Anyway, the Ministry ignores the activation of the Trace if it's within a known wizarding area. For example, if someone casts a spell near Draco in the Malfoys' manor (or basically in whichever part of Wiltshire they live in), it'll be ignored. On the other hand, any Trace activation in places such as Little Whinging would draw the Ministry's attention (because they know Harry's the only wizard who lives there).

(Yes, before someone points it out, this is very risky and kind of plothole-y, but it's just another one of those quirky things within JKR's world.)

We see in canon that Tom Riddle wasn't blamed for anything despite having a Killing-Curse Trace go off when he killed his Muggle family. However, the problem comes in when people think that it was Riddle's swapping of wands (he used Morfin's) that /defeated/ the activation of the Trace. No, Riddle worked with the Trace. He used it against Morfin at that particular moment. Then, to further pin the blame on Morfin, Riddle modified the former's memories and made sure that the Killing Curse came from Morfin's wand.

It's said in canon that the Ministry had to check Morfin's wand to see where the spell had come from. So it's not like they immediately knew that it was Morfin's wand that did it (they could have checked other wizards in the area as well, such as Riddle himself, perhaps). At that point, Morfin was the last-living Gaunt, and I'm not sure if there were any other wizarding folk living in that area. Also, Riddle probably didn't flee the scene at all, as it could be that the Ministry knew he was visiting his family.

Or perhaps Riddle was one step ahead, and knew that the Ministry would suspect that there had to be someone under the age of seventeen nearby when the Killing Curse went off. What other wizard might show up to the Riddles' manor but Tom himself? So in this case, as I've said, Riddle beat the Trace by simply working with it.

Anyway, all we really know about the Trace is as follows:

- It detects magic done within the vicinity of an underaged wizard.

- It tells the Ministry which spell was done, and where, but not perhaps which wand or who had done it.

- It's removed upon the age of seventeen, and cannot be applied to an adult.

- The Ministry is fairly inconsistent in their monitoring of it. They deliberately overlook Trace activations in very young children, especially before the age of eleven or so, and within known wizarding areas/households.

- Any magic can be detected (not just those of wizards).

- You can get special permission to trigger the Trace, such as Dumbledore somehow getting Hagrid permission to do so when fetching Harry in book one (though how he did so, I don't know. Probably because he was on good terms with Fudge back then).
