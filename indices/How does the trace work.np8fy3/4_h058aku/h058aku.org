Okay so I've just tried two times before and maybe it's because I'm tired, so I'm not going to bother with any more advanced formatting.

There are at least four ways the trace could be implemented that I can think of, the following is in reverse order of canon compliance and likelihood.

Country Wide Wards

Perhaps the most flexible. Wards are useful in that at least in fanon, they can made to be very specific. Like only detecting underage magics. You could even include that the reason why the ministry can't just make it detect magics by anyone or by political rivals or what have you is that they inherited the wards from before the ministry or from Merlin or something and the ability to make country wards is lost.

A Detection Grid

Similar to country wards, there could be a grid of magical sensors of some kind. This allows for some abilities like the ability to turn off parts of the Trace grid to protect people or during clandestine actions. A detection grid and country wards could explain how Obliviators know to deal with cases of accidental magic in public spaces, as well as magical catastrophes caused by over-age magicals.

Trace Cast on the Magical

This is probably the strongest option that properly fits into canon. It's also probably the most restrictive option depending on when it is cast. If at birth then Accidental magic detection becomes possible, but it also means that kids aren't learning wanded or wandless magics before school either. That's unlikely as it's probable most purebloods in power would want to teach their children some magic before they start school. If it happens when a magical starts school though, this makes Accidental magic detection difficult to explain

Trace on the Wand

The weakest option, as it allows the use of over-age wands with relative impunity. There's also the same issues of Accidental magic detection as above. This option though presents the most freedom for your characters. This option is the most likely in my opinion because it represents the least amount of work on the Ministry and it also provides them with a scapegoat (that being the wand maker) if things go wrong.

Of course there's nothing stopping you from using a combination of these things. For example there could be a Trace on the wand and a general magic detection grid for Accidental and Catastrophic magic. Which would plug most of the holes and allow for flexibility if you need it.
