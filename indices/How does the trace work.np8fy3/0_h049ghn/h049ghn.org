The "Trace", (as the spell) is not mentionned in the books until DH, though the concept exist since CoS when Harry received his first warning. Here are most of the mentions of the Trace in Canon:

  “But how come the Ministry didn't realize that Voldemort had done all that to Morfin?” Harry asked angrily. “He was underage at the time, wasn't he? I thought they could detect underage magic!”

  “You are quite right --- they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by ---”

  “Dobby,” growled Harry; this injustice still rankled. “So if you're underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard's house, the Ministry won't know?”

  “They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,” said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on Harry's face. “They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspring's obedience while within their walls.”

  “The Trace, the Trace!” said Mad-Eye impatiently. “The charm that detects magical activity around under-seventeens, the way the Ministry finds out about underage magic! If you, or anyone around you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse is going to know about it, and so will the Death Eaters.

  “He can't have,” said Ron. “The Trace breaks at seventeen, that's Wizarding law, you can't put it on an adult.”

  “As far as you know,” said Hermione. “What if the Death Eaters have found a way to put it on a seventeen-year-old?”

  “But Harry hasn't been near a Death Eater in the last twenty-four hours. Who's supposed to have put a Trace back on him?”

From these quotes, we can determine several thing :

1. The "Trace" is a Charm that is applied over every underage witch and wizards, and is used to determine whenever they used Magic while out of school. Canon doesn't specify when, or where is the Charm applied.\\
   I would personally speculate that the Charm is put as soon as possible (even if they would not be condemned for it, I think it's a bit silly to not monitor the children when they are the most likely to do some damages with accidental magic), with the Charm being put on the body of the child (since, in this scenario, they would not have received their wand yet).
2. While the Trace can detect any Magic cast in the vinicity of an Underage Witch or Wizards, it can't detect the perpretator. This is why Harry was blamed for Dobby's action in CoS, and why Voldemort could was never suspected of killing the Riddle.
3. Because of Tom Riddle, we can also speculate that the Ministry is unable to determine /whose/ Trace was activated. Which means that the Ministry mainly use the location of the facts to determine its suspect (any magic used in Privet Drive would be put on Harry unless proved otherwise). If Harry went to Hermione's home and cast Magic there, she may be the one receiving a Warning (though it is not confirmed in Canon).
