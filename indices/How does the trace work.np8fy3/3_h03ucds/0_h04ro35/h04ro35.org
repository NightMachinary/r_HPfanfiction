  The Trace is on the wand. All wands sold by Ollivander have the Trace on them. The Trace detects all magic cast in a certain area around the wand.

This isn't true. It's heavily implied in canon that it's on the actual person. It's referred to as being placed on people. And when Dumbledore explains how Riddle got away with killing his family, he doesn't say that Riddle used another wand (Riddle used his uncle's wand to kill them), he says that the Ministry would have assumed it was the uncle casting the spell.
