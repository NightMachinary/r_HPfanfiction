The Trace is on the wand. All wands sold by Ollivander have the Trace on them.

The Trace detects all magic cast in a certain area around the wand. HOWEVER it does NOT know who is the person/being that cast it. For example, when Dobby levitated the cake (in the summer before Chamber of Secrets) the Ministry thought that it was Harry who had done it.

With that said, if the underage witch/wizard lives with magical parents or in a magical house, the Trace /will/ detect the fact that magic is being cast but it will not know who was the one who did it. Therefore, the Ministry will think it was the parents or any other magical adult that cast it. They will have no proof that it was the underage kid, so they will ignore it.
