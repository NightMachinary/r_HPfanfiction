Part of it is likely that a good chunk of HP fandom had just managed to grow up and not have the time for writing like they did in high school and college. Let's face it, if you "grew up" with HP, you are now somewhere around 30-ish, and likely settling down into a career, a family, etc. It was one thing for fandom to be your big thing when you're working retail to pay for school, and your free time is entirely yours. It's another when you have small people that want your attention, a significant other that wants your attention, office politics to play where no one wants to be the one to jump first and mention that they're in fandom lest they be labeled "that" nerd (yes fandom is becoming way more mainstream. However a lot of "career" path jobs still have a lot of boomers/genx'ers in them and fandom was something that the "weird" people got into.)

So while HP is still popular enough to keep drawing new fans, there's never going to be the huge numbers there were when midnight release parties were HUGE events, and the line through borders/b&n to pick up your copy would snake through every aisle in the store.

It's just not as in the public eye anymore, and what is in the public eye is all crap and just makes people that might start feeling nostalgic and come back go "yeah, but cursed child was a thing that jkr sanctioned. I'm sure fic is just as bad as that these days".

Plus with no new canon to speculate on things are going to dry up. It's never going to be like the 3 year summer, where so many people got into fic because they were thirsty as hell to know what happened next and get /more/. DH ending on such a sort of anti climatic note didn't help things either.
