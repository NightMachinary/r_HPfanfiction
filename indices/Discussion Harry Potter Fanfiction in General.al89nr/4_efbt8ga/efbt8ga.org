New stories actually worth reading is a good start. Issue is that it's impossible to force people to write good stories. People need to stop worrying so much about the stations of canon or forcing pairings. Instead, we've just devolved into a state of complacency, where almost no one takes risks and it's just more of the same. That sort of thing can only hold new readers attention for so long, and then what, they're pointed to stories from 13 years ago as the pinnacle of what we have to offer?

I personally feel like there's still a lot the fandom has to offer with the base canon. I'm just one person though, and I can't write everything. Or even some things.
