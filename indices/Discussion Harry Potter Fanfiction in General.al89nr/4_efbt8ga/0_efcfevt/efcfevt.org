The thing is that people want to read the old stuff. Throw a little shade at someone and you'll get reviews praising you for bashing X and asking for way more. People expect the completely overpowered and unrealistic approach to politics as soon as the house of Black is mentioned.

I'd also argue that the major stations of canon (eg the TWT tasks for GoF or Umbridge and the visions in OotP) aren't bad to use. What is annoying if you make X changes and yet Harry still gets together with Cho under a mistletoe after the last lesson and has a spat over the interview.
