  How can we change this?

You really can't. Well, not without extremely expensive, both financially and in manpower, social engineering.

Or with new life to the franchise, which is in itself a tough order. I'm personally of the opinion that only a new series of books could achieve this, and /then/ these books would have to have an extreme pull by having some of the major characters be part of it, combined with a huge marketing apparatus. In my mind it also shouldn't be a prequel. We need high stakes, and prequels almost never deliver on that front.

But as I said once before: the HP fandom had an amazing run. It broke records left and right, brought forth some absolute masterpieces and changed the way fanfiction is perceived. There are currently 800.000+ fics on FFN alone.

Eight Hundred Thousand.

Yes it is sad that the franchise reaches the "equilibrium" state. Now it cozies up between Star Wars, Star Trek, Lord of the Rings and other vastly successful and influencial franchises.
