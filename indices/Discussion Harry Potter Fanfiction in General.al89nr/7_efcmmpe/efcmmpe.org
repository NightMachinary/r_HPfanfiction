A netflix series of some sort is most likilly to rignite interest as shows and films that launch tehre are what captures the zeitgeist most. A series of books that get turned into a netflix show about the black sisters is something i would love personally and i think its the sort of thing taht could take off. I'd really like to see Bellatrix Narcissa and Andromeda while they were at Hogwarts and see the inner workings of that complex relationship, how Bella went mad and drifted apart from Andromeda maybe with Narcissa caught in the middle betwen the sister of light and the sister of dark? It could maybe be a bit darker than the core series as we'll be dealing a lot with Bellatrix of course and the rise of Voldemort for the first time? also it would be set in the 60's(if i remember the timeline correctly) and i think that would be a cool era to explore the wizarding world. I think id enjoy it more than the current extened universe stuff with the fantastic beasts films or whatever as it would be UK based again. something about when the FB movies went to america made me lose interest really quickly its such a quintessentially English series, to me anyway, would love to return to that. Think a lot of fans would.
