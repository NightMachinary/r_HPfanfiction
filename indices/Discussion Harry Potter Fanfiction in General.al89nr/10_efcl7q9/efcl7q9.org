I think these things have a natural cycle and this one is reaching---probably not the end, but an equilibrium at least. The original fans are getting older and moving on. Maybe they don't care about it as much, maybe they are too busy with having children and making a living.

I'm not typical (although maybe I am more typical than I think) because I came to it late, had a pretty intense four years of writing it and then made a conscious decision that it was no longer for me. Why? Well, basically the 'greater fandom' (as it were) didn't want to read what I wrote and didn't write what I wanted to read.

This is the only fandom specific forum I use and I'm making an assumption (which may be wrong) that it reflects the wider fandom: but noticeably over the last year or so it feels stagnant. People are asking for the same old, same old, sort of stories. Getting the same old, same old, recommendations. Every week. Every day. Sometimes I think I'm looking at an archived page.

Let it go. You can't stop the tide.
