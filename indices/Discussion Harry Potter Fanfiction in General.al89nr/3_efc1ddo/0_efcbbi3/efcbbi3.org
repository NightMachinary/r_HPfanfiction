Yes as a community we need to become more active again when it comes to leaving reviews and engaging with the authors. I have read some amazing fanfic and when checking the reviews most were very basic "keep up the good work" , "update please" ...

I like to pick out at least one thing I enjoyed (if it still in progres per chapter) and leave a review outlining what I liked, as well as mentioning everything that seems unclear or things that would help my understanding (paragraphs!!!!).

About your last point: I miss the very detailed challenges that used to be popular. I don't need novel length answers but maybe some nice one shots, sometimes author's continued or refined their work based on these answers to challenges
