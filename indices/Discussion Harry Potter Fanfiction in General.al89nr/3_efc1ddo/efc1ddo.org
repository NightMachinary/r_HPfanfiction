I don't like the idea of adding new content to the original foundation of the fandom: the 7 Harry Potter books. Everything new that has been added has been okay (Pottermore as a Buzzfeed-like trivia/encyclopedia page) to disappointing (Fantastic Beasts film series) to downright horrible (Cursed Child).

I'm more of the mind that we shouldn't try to stop a trend that is going to happened regardless of what this small community here does. But we can try to /slow/ it, keep the authors and creators in this fandom, and continuing to create content instead of leaving for the next cool new franchise or series.

We as a community should be more interactive and engaging with creators. Give them a reason to stay and keep producing nice things for us to read.

- Encourage authors, instead of downvoting people who ask for advice on their fics, or self-promote their work here. I see that happen all the time here, and I don't understand why. This is the HPfanfic sub, they are discussing HPfanfic. It's not off-topic, therefore downvoting is going against the Reddit standard of conduct.

- Read fics and engage with the authors. If there's a fic you liked enough to recommend, and you recommended it to another user here, why not copy and paste your rec to the fic's Review submission form on FFN.net or Ao3? Maybe the author would like to hear that people liked their work. When I see people discussing an ongoing fic that is actively being updated, that's the kind of thing that authors would probably like to see, and maybe would have a response to. But of course they never see it because it's a random reddit thread posted at 4AM in their timezone.

- Take steps in writing the content we want to see. Instead of complaining about horrible harem fics and how they never work, why not write a fic where this is explored in a realistic way? Instead of asking for ridiculously specific prompts in a thread, why not take 20 minutes to write a small snippet to post along with the idea?
