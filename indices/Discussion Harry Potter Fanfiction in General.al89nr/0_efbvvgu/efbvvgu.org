That's just the natural rise and fall of fandom, I'm afraid. Even big, popular, prolific fandoms eventually go quiet when the series ends and people find new interests. That the HP fandom still, over 11 years since the last book, has enough people to sustain a fanfic subreddit, is really quite incredible.

I'm with you on mourning the relative dearth of new fics, but being on the tail-end of a fandom's lifespan has its advantages, too - there's a big huge backlog of fics to sift through, and fewer people tends to mean less wank.
