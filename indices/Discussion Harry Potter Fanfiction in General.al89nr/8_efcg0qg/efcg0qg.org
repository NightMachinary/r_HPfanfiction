The thing is that writing something new (eg Harry/Lavender while she is the one entered in the TWT) will get you almost no responses because most of the FFN reader base is not interested in such things. And we are not representative of the overall site populations when it comes to taste and standards.

For example, I've written a HIMYM inspired postwar story and despite tagging the thing properly and posting on both popular sites, it simply got no clicks whatsoever. I had more success with a Hermione/Tonks one-shot, and that is beyond niche pairings. Not even bad reviews but simply nothing. So that idea got shelved and I took it down.
