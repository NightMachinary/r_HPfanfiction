I don't mean to say slice of life is bad, just that I'm not really interested in reading it.

Especially as it relates to Harry Potter where there are a ton of stories that are actually relatively interesting, even if many of them are somewhat unoriginal at this point.

If I wanted slice of life, there are many other fandoms or even romance novels that offer a better setting, especially considering the absolutely *horrendous* selection of innately preferable femslash pairings in the Harry Potter fandom(in my strict opinion, of course-- I'm not saying that no femslash pairings are likable, but there is definitely not very many stories when unique, interesting pairings come along, and a lot of the girls in canon don't exactly have the best chemistry. Fem!harry femslash is probably some of the best stuff out there, and there's not very many fem!harry femslash fics)

Edit: It's also worth noting that I don't watch TV shows like HIMYM or any other long-running episodic comedy TV show, so it really is primarily a personal preference thing.
