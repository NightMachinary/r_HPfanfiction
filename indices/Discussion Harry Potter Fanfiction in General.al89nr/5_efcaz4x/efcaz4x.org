When I got into fanfiction I was in a number of fandoms, besides HP Dark Angel and Alias were the fandoms I was most active in. As those series ended so did their fandoms, which is too bad because with social media being what it is today I think those series would do really well today. I am amazed that great HP fanfiction is still being written, I still get updates and new alerts and I constantly find great unknown fics (thanks in part to this reddit). Without new and decent source material becoming creative and innovative is hard. I remember that a lot of great fanfics were written for challenges (which lead to the formation of tropes) but as the HP only fanfic sites are slowly dying out that can become difficult.
