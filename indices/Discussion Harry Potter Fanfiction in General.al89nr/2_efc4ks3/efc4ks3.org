We are not seeing the decline of the HP fandom. We are seeing its normalisation. Nothing will ever match the hype around the HP books at the time they were being released, but the fandom has far too much critical mass to simply disappear. There are much smaller fandoms out there that tick along with barely any new material being released (see: Star Trek) and Harry Potter will likely continue in that vein for many years to come. But 2005-2009 will not happen again, I'm afraid. Even if JKR were to publish a great new series, it would not revive the massive hype of the original series, which was a unique event in the history of publishing.
