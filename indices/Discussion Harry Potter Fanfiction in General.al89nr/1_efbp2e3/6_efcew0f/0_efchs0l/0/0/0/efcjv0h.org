Yes, but there's a difference between Ginny or Bill, who are characterised according to canon in at least half of the stories where they are part of the main cast, and Malfoy, who gets whitewashed in at least 90% of the stories where he is the protagonist. You have more accurate depictions of Malfoy when he is the antagonists than when he is the protagonist.

At that point, people are writing OCs and call them Draco Malfoy.
