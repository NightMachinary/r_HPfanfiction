I'd argue that a next-Gen story based on the epilogue world would not be very popular. Because that one was a punch in the gut, even if you liked the pairings. Ron brags about assaulting a muggle's mind, Harry does not even call him out, Snape and Dumbledore, the number two and three people who caused suffering in Harry's life (no Dumbledore, no Dursleys), were heroes, the entire battle with its deaths was inconsequential because "all was well" and Malfoy was not in prison.

You'd need to revamp that part of the series if you want to successfully build on it.
