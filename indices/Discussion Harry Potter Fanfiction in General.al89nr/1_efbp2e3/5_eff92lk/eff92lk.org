This is such a pessimistic view! Massive fandoms stick around for many, many years, and I expect HP to do the same. People are still writing Tolkien/LOTR fanfiction decades after its publication---yes, the movies obviously gave a big popularity bump, but there are still quite a few people writing fics about hardcore book material, and overall there's a decent influx of material. Things will slow down, but as long as HP remains a pop culture classic, there will always be people interested in writing HPFF. Keep making content, and most importantly, keep encouraging the next generation to get into HP. You hear lots of stories about how people got introduced to LOTR because their parents read The Hobbit to them for their bedtime stories, or how showing your kids the Star Wars movies for the first time is an anticipated family event---that's how you maintain a fandom (and fanfiction) in the years to come.
