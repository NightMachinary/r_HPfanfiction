This is just the cycle of fandom. Something new and exciting comes out and people want to create stuff for it---stories, art, whatever. New original content stops being produced and interest wanes. I've observed this with a couple of anime fandoms. In the mid-late 90s, Ranma 1/2 was hot---the manga was still being translated, the OAVs, TV series and movies were newish to the US and there was a ton of fanfiction. Now none of those archives are around and you're probably like “What 1/2?”

Same thing with Gundam Wing. Cartoon Network starts showing the show, fanfiction rapidly follows. Show goes off the air, people forget, creation drops off. Harry Potter has definitely slowed down from when I first started writing in 2005. Back then there were a ton of archives, Live Journal and FFN full of people writing, sharing and feverishly speculating how JKR would end things. I don't think HPFF is anywhere close to dying, but one day it will unless new original content is created ad Blandage said.
