  I believe there is NOTHING the HP fandom can do to stop the slow, inevitable decline and death of HPFF. Any marketing attempt, new ideas or tropes, new character approaches, or anything of the like would at best cause a minor uptick in a general downward trend that leads to the ruining of your childhood. Sorry.

Decline? Yes. Death? No.

Why?

Because at the end of the day there will always be a hardcore core of folks, and that core will refresh as new blood is drawn in. Like any book series, there are generational cycles. As one generation ages out, another ages in. While the popularity will never approach the original levels, both in terms of the original content and invented content via fanfiction/art/whatever, the idea that interest would die is silly.
