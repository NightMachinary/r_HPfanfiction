  Decline? Yes. Death? No.

The "slow" modifier is the key word here. It might take many years-- hell it might take a thousand years. Shit there have been fanfics for The Illiad published recently on FFN, but the community will eventually wither and die with the heat death of the universe.

I get your point though. Perhaps I was being a bit over dramatic. The core community will likely endure for decades. It's kinda sad to think that in 50 years we'll still be hoping our favorite stories update, but we'll know in our hearts there's a good chance the author is dead or dying soon.
