We just discussed this on the [[/r/HPFanfiction]] Discord ~2 days ago. There's only one thing that can cause a MAJOR resurgence in HPFF interest.

A new, wildly popular Harry Potter series in the form of:

- A full length book series written by JK Rowling

- A TV series that approaches the popularity (and quality) of shows like Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, or Rick and Morty

- A movie series as popular as Marvel or Star Wars

In order for any of these things to happen, it is my personal opinion that side stories or historical events about side characters will not produce the type of popularity needed to really boost the HP fandom.

The new series MUST be about the Potters. Specifically, it must be about one of the following:

- Harry

- Harry's parents

- Harry's children

I'm almost certain that a series about any other character in any other era would do little better than Fantastic Beasts.

In response to your specific question about what we can do. I believe there is NOTHING the HP fandom can do to stop the slow, inevitable decline and death of HPFF. Any marketing attempt, new ideas or tropes, new character approaches, or anything of the like would at best cause a minor uptick in a general downward trend that leads to the ruining of your childhood. Sorry.
