I've never heard of the story you mentioned, quickly googled it...

So it's a story set long after Hogwarts where Harry no longer sees her like a sister and they develop a relationship.

I can't read the entire thing right now as I'm halfway through another fic (1M+ words), could you mention a few more things that you'd like to see in recommend fics? It's much easier to recommend something when I know what you're looking for without having to read through a long fic that I might not like myself first.

Personally my absolute top favorite completed post Hogwarts Harry/Hermione relationship (after both had other relationships) would be linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief), but since I haven't read Unlike a Sister all I'm basing this recommendation on is that it's H/Hr and post Hogwarts.

Edit: Unlike a Sister has way more chapters posted on FFN than AO3, if you've used AO3 you might've overlooked those
