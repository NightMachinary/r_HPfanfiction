Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

It's almost entirely just the events of the year 1996 after secrecy ended. International geopolitics are thrown into mayhem, religions struggle to accept the existence of wizards, scientist get a whole new field to study and Voldemort gets his hands on nukes. Oh, and Osama Bin Laden cancels that plane idea in favor of bombing the american ministry of magic (not MACUSA because the fic is old). Only like 10% of it is actually about the people at Hogwarts, most is events around the world.

I'm actually like 95% done with it right now, I started it a while ago and now it's getting time for the finale against Rasputin.
