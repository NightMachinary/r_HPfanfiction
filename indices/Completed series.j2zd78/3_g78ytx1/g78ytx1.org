If you are looking for darker stories, then you can't go wrong with the downward spiral series starting with linkffn(Harry Potter and the Homecoming). Starts with a Grey!Harry who is raised in an orphanage and due to the circumstances he faces at Hogwarts, becomes much more dark over time. Awesome series, and will certainly keep you entertained. PS: It spans all 7 books!!!
