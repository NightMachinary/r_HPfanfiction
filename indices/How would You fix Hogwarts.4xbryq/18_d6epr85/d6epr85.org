Why isn't there a class specifically taught for Wandless Magic? Why do they start at 11 years of age? If they started at 4-5 years old instead of 11 they would be much better wizards when the time came, like having people like Neville and Ron who need training to learn spells. The house system..get rid of it. Charms and Defense should be the same class, but a double period. Combat Appration not taught? No Sophisticated Dueling Club? Despite having a Dueling champion as a teacher?! No Clubs in general? No practical transfiguration?(For battle etc..). Care of Magical Creatures should not limit itself, should teach spells for certain creatures, travel to places to see different magical animals, getting a magical familiar(instead of randomly guessing at an emporium that only has 3 different types of pets). Wandlore/Wand crafting classes. That's all I can think of for now.
