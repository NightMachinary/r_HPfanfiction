  Why isn't there a class specifically taught for Wandless Magic?
#+end_quote

What do we know about wandless magic? I know some fanfiction have so either it's somewhat harder than wands, you have to powerful wizard(and main character is one), or there is a certain way of doing it. I don't remember anything about wandless magic except it's really hard to do?
