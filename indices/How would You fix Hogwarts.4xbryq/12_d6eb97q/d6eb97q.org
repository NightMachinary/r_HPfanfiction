Well I'd burn the sorting hat. To remove the house divide. And secondly a competent Umbridge? I highly doubt that. But let's see what you come up with ..

More needs to be done to integrate muggleborns in their society. So mugglestudies for purebloods and half-bloods while wizard studies for muggleborns.

Some teachers need to be replaced. More staff needs to be added.

That should fix a lot of the problems there are. We are talking about Hogwarts and not the general wizarding world so I wont bother going into that.
