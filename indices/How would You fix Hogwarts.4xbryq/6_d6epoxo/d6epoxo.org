My personal list of reforms:

- More electives. It would be nice to bring in a few teachers to offer classes on a specialized topic like wandlore or healing. It would be great if Hogwarts also had an independent study option as well. There really should be foreign language electives too.
- I question the relevance of Astronomy, but I don't think we know enough about the subject to discount it entirely. I also question the wisdom of making kids as young as eleven stay up past 1am in the middle of the week.
- Combine Herbology and Potions into one class. Honestly, most students don't need five or seven years of education on growing plants. They just need to know how to use them. If they want to learn more about Herbology, they can pursue it as an elective.
- Replace Herbology with a muggle studies track. First year students from magical households would spend a year learning about the basics of muggle culture (i.e., clearing up misconceptions and how to blend in when in muggle areas), while muggleborn first years would spend that time getting an introduction to the wizarding world. Students would be allowed to "test out" of either subject, because some students might have a good understanding of both or have grown up in the muggle world despite wizarding parentage. After about first year, all students would spend a few years learning muggle subjects like Applied Maths, writing skills, etc. After fourth year, that class would end. Students could chose to take classes on muggle culture and get an N.E.W.T. in Muggle Studies, or just chose another class.
- Seventh years would also get a one time lesson about how to survive/blend in the muggle world, to prepare them for interacting with muggles, blending in muggle areas, and/or renting an apartment or buying a house from a muggle.
- Sack Binns and totally overhaul History of Magic curriculum. A few years of ancient magical history, a year of muggle history with a lot of geography, then three years of modern history both magical and muggle. After O.W.L.s, the class would focus on Magical law and governments and international relations.
- Higher standards for teachers. Hogwarts is the biggest and most important magical school in the country, so it really should be the first stop for anyone interested in education or anyone particularly knowledgeable in one specific subject. It's completely capable of attracting top talent, with a reasonable salary and perks. If possible, I think they should get a second teacher for each of the core subjects or hire a teacher who can teach, say, 1-2 year Charms and 1-2 year Transfiguration. The teachers at Hogwarts must have an insanely high workload.
- More inter-house activities and clubs. It would be great if there was some sort of common space for students to relax together if they're not in the same house. Maybe a nice big room with couches, tables, games, etc. More electives would also mean more house-mixing. I don't know what the official policy on sitting at other house tables is. It seems like it's allowed, but not done particularly often. In my opinion, the students should be encouraged to mix during lunch and breakfast, and then eat dinner with their own house.
- Expand the Quidditch team to include more students. It doesn't make sense to only take seven people. They should have teams of fourteenish, so that when a starting player leaves school or injures himself mid-year, there's someone trained and ready to take his place. Also, it means more students get the opportunity to be on the team in the first place. You could also have a few more players and have a kind of junior championship. That way, Hogwarts gets twice as many games and more people can play Quidditch.
