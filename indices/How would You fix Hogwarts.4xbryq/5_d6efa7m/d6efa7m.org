How I would fix Hogwarts? I would strive to create an environment that would encourage students to study magic and learn Life Skills beyond just the classroom.

To that end, I would install hundreds of bloodthirsty stone gargoyles in the halls that would come alive at night and hunt students violating the curfew. I would charm the Great Hall to eat people who fall asleep there after festive banquets. I would hire a castle vampire to roam the halls and prey on unobservant students. I think that's a good start.
