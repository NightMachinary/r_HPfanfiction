I'd start by replacing teachers I think aren't any good (either at their subject or they lack the qualities for the job of teaching or for their other responsibilities):

- Snape (putting instructions on the board and then watching students fail - and not even prohibiting sabotage - is not teaching and neither is punishing people for breathing and protecting bullies (Malfoy and the other Slytherins!))

- Trewlaney (FRAUD! She might make the occasional prophecy but otherwise she's USELESS!)

- McGonagal (yes, I dare - why? She doesn't believe her students when they come to her in need (the protection of the stone for example) and she doesn't even stand up for them ("keep your head down") and she doesn't give the students tips about electives (Harry would not have chosen Trewlaney's class if he knew it was total BS!) etc....she can stay on as deputy headmistress (with a stipulation that she does not take over as headmistress if the current headmaster were to die etc.) and take 6th and 7th years in transfiguration, but she wouldn't be head of Gryffindor anymore)

- Filius Flitwick (he'd lose head of Ravenclaw because of Luna and the bullies he either couldn't control or didn't want to control, he can stay on as a teacher because he's good at that!)

- Hagrid (danger to the students - I mean yeah he knows his stuff, but he forgets that not everybody is a half-giant and can wrestle werewolfs with one arm if need be -.-)

- The History Ghost: Binns (exorcism! Be gone you pest!)

- Sprout (again because of bullying - she can't stop her supposed fair house from bullying Harry in GoF! She can keep on teaching, but she'll lose head of Hufflepuff!)

After that I'd hire more staff (at least two teachers per subject and maybe even three in the core subjects to allow the teachers to take on apprentices from the students and do research in their subjects (part of the money of anything discovered goes to the school, but the person who did the research gets the majority of the money and the recognition for his/her work)) and look into establishing more courses (or reviving old ones - if there were any, I mean Hogwarts has a lot of unused classrooms so it's likely that several courses were discontinued! I mean we don't know if enchanting was ever taught, but that might be an interesting class to add, same for warding and ward-breaking (curse-breaking) etc.).

I'd discontinue DADA (yes! Why? - So that the curse won't affect my MAMD (Mundane and Magical Defense) class that teaches everythind DADA does, but also some dark arts (why? Durmstrang isn't evil and they teach them!) and even some weapon handling (for a wizard a muggle is quite dangerous if armed, at the same level as many lesser magical pests, so recognizing muggle weapons is important IMHO) from fencing to some limited practice with guns!)

I'd offer muggle courses (maths, literature, languages etc. even at a level to get a muggle education at the same time as you do your wizard one...wouldn't lock the muggleborn into the magical world, that's kind of unfair!), but also a class on wizard-traditions and politics! (muggleborns would have to attend, same for halfbloods who fail at testing out of it, but in return the purebloods would have to attend muggle-studies (I'd upgrade that constantly, so no teaching about Victorian-England!))

Also: NO MORE QUILLS! (Use a fucking fountain-pen it's not the 1800's anymore!)

No more point-system, no more Hogsmeade-Weekends (I'd let the students visit the village whenever they want, as long as they are back at the castle before a certain time (say 8 o'clock for first to fourth years and 9 o'clock for fifth to sixth years and seventh years can stay longer (till 10 or as long as they want if they are 17!)) with that privilege being taken away if they don't do their homework etc. (I see no reason to isolate the students...hell, I might abolish the boarding school for non-muggleborn students (floo and portkeys work just fine after all)...it would be too taxing on the statute of secrecy to have muggleborns teleport to school every day!)

I'd upgrade the castle (fix stuff like doors leading somewhere else at different days etc. - that serves no purpose at best and is dangerous at worst!), offer muggle sports (stuff like a tennis-court and a soccer-stadium), upgrade the astronomy tower (how about a true observatory or a planetarium?), swimming classes (and an indoor pool), experiment with installing modern lighting (electricity) etc. (if the wizard wireless works by immitating a radio, why not make a TV that works on magic?)

Get rid of most of the portraits (as headmaster I am not a peeping Tom, so I don't need them to keep an eye on the students!)...not by destroying them, but by moving them to rooms especially for portraits

I'd install some sort of announcement system etc. etc. :)
