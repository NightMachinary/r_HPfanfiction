I think people also have a vastly inflated idea of how many people are in the wizarding world, and of how many muggleborns there are. If we take some numbers from Hogwarts (just talking about some rough estimates from canon here) then muggleborns are less than 5% of the wizarding population. We know for sure of about three in Potter's year, Potter's year is also probably smaller than most because of his generation being born during a war. But we do know that Hogwarts has about 500 students at the VERY upper end of the scale, probably more like 300 on average. Let's just assume that, just to be generous, 20% of parents send their kids to Beauxbatons or Durmstrang. That allows for 360-600 students across seven years of schooling from Magical Britain. That's less than a tenth of a percent of the British non-magical school population.

That allows for maybe twenty thousand British Magicals, at the outside, and roughly 600 to 800 of those at any given time would be Muggleborns, less than a fifth of those (roughly 100 - 140) would be effective teachers, less than a tenth of those who would be effective teachers would be interested in teaching. So roughly 15 Muggleborns in any given period of wizarding history would be applicable candidates for the post of ANY teaching position at Hogwarts, never mind the specific field of Muggle Studies. Then consider that (and this is conjecture) a little under half of all Muggleborns probably leave the magical world entirely or live as muggles with little to no interaction with the magical world after leaving Hogwarts. A fair proportion of them probably also leave to go overseas.

Tldr: There's basically a very tiny proportion of the population that could ever be a muggle studies teacher AND a muggleborn
