I think your estimate is too low. If we know for sure about 3 in Harry's year, and there are 40 in his year, then that percentage should already be higher (I think).

Also, its a fair extrapolation that of the student's whose blood status we don't know, a similar percentage are muggleborn or halfbloods, suggesting that the percentage of muggleborns are higher than just the students we know about/the 5%.

I suppose you'd argue that the higher number of muggleborn students would still be as low as 5% because you assume some students from wizarding families will study abroad.
