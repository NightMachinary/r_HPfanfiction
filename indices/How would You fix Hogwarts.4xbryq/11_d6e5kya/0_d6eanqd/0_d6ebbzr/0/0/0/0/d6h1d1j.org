Honestly I agree, my estimate probably is too low. I reiterate that I was making rough estimates, I didn't take the time to make them exact numbers. The point was that, in a world without Voldemort, the number would have been tiny. Add in the second blood war, and we have to consider that a fair number of the Muggleborns were probably slaughtered. or fled the country never to return. Regardless the number of eligible candidates is still terrifyingly low
