I think all first years should be required to take a combined class on Muggle Studies and Wizard Studies. The purebloods (and wizard-raised halfbloods) might learn tolerance for Muggles if they learn about convenient Muggle inventions (like pens vs. quills & ink) and the Muggle-born could learn about wizarding customs which many kids might not learn even having been raised in a wizarding household, like traditional wizard dance, the importance of the wizarding government, etc.
