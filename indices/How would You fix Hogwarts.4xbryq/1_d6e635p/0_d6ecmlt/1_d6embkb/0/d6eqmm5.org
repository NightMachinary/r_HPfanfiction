Thanks for the tip.

  In other words, all instructors are expected to teach writing in addition to their subject. And they haven't received any formal training. Part of the point of a class is standardization -- as is, the proper format of an essay for Snape might be radically different from the proper format of an essay for Flitwick.

True. However, I assumed that writing was considered to be acquired before starting Hogwarts. As well as basic Maths (and in their society almost nobody really needs more than basic Maths).

  In contrast, students can choose about a quarter of their courses when they're thirteen, and they choose all their courses when they're fifteen. Depending on the exact use of runes and arithmancy, you might find your career choices highly affected by which electives you chose and which courses you took to NEWT level. Care of Magical Creatures will certainly have an impact.

I would agree with this, but to my experience (and that of others), I don't think I ever seen one of those advisors having the interrests of the kids at heart. They had their idea of what a kid had to do according to their grades, and sometimes really messed up things for some. I think in a lot of case, just give a book or let the parents sort that out witk their kid would've done less damage (depending on the parents, of course).

Hogwarts seems like Hands on education, you learn skills as well as knowledge (since knowledge is skill). I guess you just pick what you need on the way, for anything that's no magic.
