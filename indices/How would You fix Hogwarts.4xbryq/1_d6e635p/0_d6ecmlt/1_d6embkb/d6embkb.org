  Adding Maths I can see why, but writing? Dude, all homework is essay in HP!

In other words, all instructors are expected to teach writing in addition to their subject. And /they/ haven't received any formal training. Part of the point of a class is standardization -- as is, the proper format of an essay for Snape might be radically different from the proper format of an essay for Flitwick.

    A career fair a few weeks before the end of term in second year, followed by one-on-one guidance, would be awesome.

  That's not my experience of that sort of things in the real world...

This isn't about converting Hogwarts into a Muggle school; it's about what is best for the kids.

How much freedom did you have in selecting classes? In my school, I could choose a foreign language to learn, and that's it. Zero impact on career options.

In contrast, students can choose about a quarter of their courses when they're thirteen, and they choose all their courses when they're fifteen. Depending on the exact use of runes and arithmancy, you might find your career choices highly affected by which electives you chose and which courses you took to NEWT level. Care of Magical Creatures will certainly have an impact.

When you're thirteen, you don't think ahead like that. When you're fifteen, you probably won't think about career options unless you are prompted.
