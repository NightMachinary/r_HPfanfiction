This is specifically about academics, the classroom, and standard school stuff. Addressing safety concerns is a given.

More teaching staff. As is, a core subject instructor at Hogwarts is in class roughly 40% more hours than their students. Not doing the math, but seven core subjects plus electives, doubles or singles classes across four houses. This means either instructors need Time-Turners or students have huge gaps in their schedules. Two instructors for each core subject goes a long way to addressing this problem. Adding in writing and maths for at least the first two years would help, too.

Annual checkups with the school nurse.

With standardized cirricula, the school itself could purchase textbooks, which helps poorer students. This would also somewhat insulate against the high turnover rate for the Defense position.

Standardized punishments.

The point system seems mostly useless. It's group punishment for individual misdeeds. The effects of the punishment aren't seen until the end of the year; in September, probably nobody cares about the House Cup.

You're expected to use a quill. That's a skill that most Muggle-raised don't have. There should be something to address that -- it could be incorporated into a writing class.

There seems to be no guidance about choosing your electives, even though that will have a large impact on career choices. A career fair a few weeks before the end of term in second year, followed by one-on-one guidance, would be awesome.
