All students on the house Quidditch teams should be using the same or equivalent brooms. The fact that Harry is allowed first a Nimbus Two Thousand and then a Firebolt, both of which are /professional level brooms/, is absurd. Sports should be a level playing field, where only skill and hard training give you an edge. Literally none of the houses can even compete with him until Malfoy's dad buys the Slytherin team top of the line brooms. It's no wonder why Harry set all kinds of records for catching the Snitch; the school equipment is all outdated.
