While I agree with what you said, I don't think the other players would be using the ancient school brooms. they probably own their own brooms that are at least of decent quality, though still not on the level of what Harry has.

As a side note, using the absolute fastest broom on the market might be good for a seeker, but other positions might be better suited for brooms that optimize other qualities such as maneuverability (chasers) or stability (beaters).
