To fit with the canon of the wizarding world as established, you couldn't give too much support or prominence to Muggle Studies or introduce a logic/science course. Wizards mainly disdain these things. Muggle Studies could remain an elective as it is.

Literature would presumably fall into History. Music/Art could be extracurricular classes. For Health, I would propose a basic Healing class - it does seem a bit surreal that there isn't one, given that the ability to heal wounds would be a useful skill for all wizards and witches to have, if they all have the latent ability.

Get a new teacher for History of Magic and make it more prominent and important. New teacher for Potions; possibly keep Snape as an advanced instructor who occasionally takes a class of younger students; that allows him to keep his nasty reputation and enmity with Harry, without being a constant presence of nastiness in his life. Snape could then be contrasted with the good teacher, and the promise of more Snape in the future could put students off continuing with Potions.

I would probably bring Arithmancy and Runes down to being compulsory classes, perhaps starting in second year on. To balance that, I'd move Astronomy up to being an elective, since no character in the books ever seems to get any use whatsoever out of it. Divination I would keep as-is. Trelawney is unorthodox, but how she's seen by students isn't helped by people like McGonagall and Dumbledore who have a very particular worldview undermining and ridiculing her at every turn.

I'd also draw more parallels between Herbology, Potions, and the new Healing class. It always struck me as unlikely in canon that somebody with such an understanding of plants and herbs as Neville could be so completely inept at Potions that likely dealt with the same ingredients or composite parts. Some of it would be down to Snape, of course, but you'd think Neville would at least get the theory.

As for Defense - well, I would have someone actually investigate why teachers only last a year, if it's been a pattern for 20 or so years by this point. If that counteracts the 'wizards don't have logic' argument, have Hermione point it out in first year - she's read about it in Hogwarts: A History, after all.

As an additional note, if you are going down the route of an 'Inquisitor' type character, have them question why Filch - a Squib - is hired for the /one/ role in the castle that a wizard would be definitely better suited for. Filch is a cleaner and security guard, both things that he has to do without magic. Tasks that a wizard could accomplish in minutes would take Filch much longer. Is it any wonder he's always so grouchy?
