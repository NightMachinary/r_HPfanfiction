Divination gets shit on a lot in cannon. However, there are types of magic that could be considered divination that don't just have to do with predicting the future. It's my opinion that the class is just taught extremely poorly. What we see in the book is just two-bit fortune-telling minus any of the actual tricks of the trade. Instead, the class ought to be teaching things such as scrying/farsight, detection spells, interpreting prophecy, legillimency/occlumency, vision-questing, extra-sensory perception (how to sense magic, etc), astral projection, how to use and make divination-related magical tools (beyond 'stare harder and open you inner eye!'), and some way to identify and instruct actual seers. All of these things could be considered divination in the sense that divination is about 'attempting to foretell future events or discover hidden knowledge by magical means'.

My take on Filch: Filch's responsibilities are coordinating and overseeing detentions, managing the lost-and-found (unclaimed items go into RoR storage at the end of the year) and confiscated items, and coordinating the house elves' maintenance duties with student detention crews. He's not really serious about the use of torture as a means of discipline; he just likes messing with troublemakers' heads.
