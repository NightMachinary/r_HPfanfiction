Double the amount of teachers. Probably even more than that, but doubling would go a long way towards fixing the majority of issues.

Make the head of house an actual separate job, and not allow teachers to do it. In high school we had councilors that did nothing but be the person you go to for any problem academic or social. Heads of house seemingly fill the same role, except have entirely too much work to ever actually do it.

Some sort of introduction to being a wizard class. The equivalent of muggle studies, except for muggleborns and a required class for first years.

Not sure if this would actually do anything, but I think being resorted every year would go a long ways towards fixing a lot of the house bias. With a proper amount of teachers/adults keeping an eye on things this might not be an issue to begin with though.

Potentially have more clubs. Its hard to say if hogwarts only has like 3-4 clubs or if Harry is just so ignorant of everything going on around him that he never hears about more. More is never a bad thing though, and with more teachers getting supervision shouldn't be a problem.

I'd also move potions out of the dungeons. No ventilation just can't be a safe thing for anyone, much less growing kids who seemingly melt cauldrons on the regular.

Replace Filch. That man has no business being around kids. He legitimately wants to hang them up by chains for punishment. Just no.

I'd also have some sort of detention hall. No reason for each teacher to have to deal with trouble makers individually, just send them all to one place and have someone in charge of punishments.
