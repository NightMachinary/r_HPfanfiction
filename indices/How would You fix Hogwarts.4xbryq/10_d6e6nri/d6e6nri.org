First of all, Hogwarts doesn't need to be fixed... /in the canon universe/. In canon, Hogwarts fulfilled its role in the crazy, fantastical society that JKR created. Just because it doesn't match our perception of how society /should/ work doesn't mean it's wrong.

But for the sake of the question, let's assume Hogwarts exists within /our/ version of common sense. This would pose a /ton/ of problems.

The first problem with Hogwarts is the same as the problems with other schools. The community needs to be fixed first. In our universe, magical society would perish unless it upgraded to the modern era. There's two options:

1. advance magical society past muggle society and become highly segregated, sorta like "caretakers"
2. integrate with muggle society.

In canon, magicals half-heartedly attempt to do both at once and aren't effective at either. Their impact on muggle society is at best a nuisance, and they typically refuse to interact with muggles for any length of time.

So option 1 is typically the route taken in "competent-Ministry" AU fics. In these fics the Ministry is highly effective at hiding magical society and they are very separate from muggles.

Option 2 is a bit more interesting and this is where the answer to OP's question comes in. Here's how I would revamp Hogwarts:

Dissolve magical society. Entirely.

Keeping wizards and witches separate is the cause of pureblood prejudice, which in turn could fuel world-conquering Dark Wizards. The nuclear solution is to delete pureblood society. Hogwarts becomes an *integration* school. Magical children learn to live in muggle society and benefit global society from within. Everyone learns dozens of languages, cultures, and a vast amount of history. Magic stays hidden and is used to accelerate the education of wizards and witches, who become the brightest of humanity. Graduates become world leaders and great minds. Technology and magic are combined to advance science even faster than our current rate.

But all this only works in /our/ world. In canon, these ideas are stupid because magical society, apart from a few Dark Wizards, is successful and prosperous---JKR gives no indication that society needs change as indicated by DH's epilogue. Everything just goes back to normal.

Hogwarts works because JKR says so. Hermione says most wizards don't have an ounce of logic and yet magical Britain is still a functioning society. Saying otherwise is highly AU (and not a bad idea).
