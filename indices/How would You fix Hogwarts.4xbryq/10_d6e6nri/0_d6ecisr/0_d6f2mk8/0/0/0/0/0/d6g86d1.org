Communism does a lot more than placing ownership of the means of production in the hands of the workers.

But What i'm talking about is not specific to communism, it goes for fascism as well, and nazism, and even sociolism.

Those are all ideologies that have a rigid society model and are trying to change their populations by various means to fit in said model.

Things like politised education, working and reeduction camps, purges...

The goal is to remove the elements that doesn't fit from the population.

Those are the extreme, of course, but the root problem is trying to "fix" the community. Because the only effective way to fix the community is tyranny.
