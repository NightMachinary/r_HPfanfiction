Where to begin...

"The community needs to be fixed first. In our universe, magical society would perish unless it upgraded to the modern era."

A community doesn't need to be fixed. That's the communist road and we know where it leads. The rules and government, however, can be fixed or changed. Secondely, I really don't know why you imply that wizarding society is retarded. it's not the case, it simply works differently. Because of magic. Who needs a freezer when you can just cast a preservation charm on your food?

"In canon, magicals half-heartedly attempt to do both at once and aren't effective at either. Their impact on muggle society is at best a nuisance, and they typically refuse to interact with muggles for any length of time."

In canon, wizards try to stay hidden from the general population and not to interract with it and that's it. They don't try to lead it or integrate it anymore than what is necessary to keep the secret. Wich is doable when you got magic.

"Keeping wizards and witches separate is the cause of pureblood prejudice, which in turn could fuel world-conquering Dark Wizards."

Integrating to the muggle world would lead to a wizard dominated world where muggles can't take any position of power. And where wizards would be hated by the most part of the general population.

The pureblood prejudice is most certainly a complex problem with a lot of causes, not all of them being illegitimate. Simply stating that pureblood biggots hate muggles because they don't know them is an oversimplification that wouldn't allow one to assess the real causes of the stuff.

A lot of the pureblood biggots are also power sluts. What do you think would happen if they where to take a leading position in the muggle world? Someone like Lucius Malfoy or Dolores Umbridge or even Cornelius Fudge?

"Dissolve magical society. Entirely."

I think I would go the other way around. Try to find a way to turn muggles into wizards in discreetly distribute it in the muggle society. But aither way, its not the politics you carry that's so important than the way you carry them and the support you need and have to carry them.

"Hogwarts becomes an integration school. Magical children learn to live in muggle society and benefit global society from within. Everyone learns dozens of languages, cultures, and a vast amount of history. Magic stays hidden and is used to accelerate the education of wizards and witches, who become the brightest of humanity."

Those kinds of elitist programs usually dont end so well. Don't you think it would serve the pureblood biggots if nearly all magical are better educated than any muggle by a large margin?

"Technology and magic are combined to advance science even faster than our current rate." Why? I can see the point in integrating science to the magical world, and it's certainly already done, but why would someone that has magic need any technology. Is there anything there that can't be achieved with magic?

"Hermione says most wizards don't have an ounce of logic and yet magical Britain is still a functioning society."

Hermione's not god. Hermione can be wrong. You can't take the word of a teenager, however bright she may be, as the word of god. Especially when talking about society problems. The young always think the old is dumb.

And good logic isn't that common in the muggle world either.
