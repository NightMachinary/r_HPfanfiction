There are a ton of possibilities for classes...but, realistically, this is Wizard high school (or whatever the UK equivalent to high school is). We don't do much past basics really. There should be higher education institutions to prepare people but that seems to be taken on by the department who hires them. So it's weird. Some of those would be great basic intros because all wizards should know them BUT they might not have time for them while at Hogwarts.

I might be wrong but Hermione needed a time turner just to take the, maybe, five extra electives her third year, right? And most were pretty standard as far as future job possibilities - except Muggle Studies and Divination. She dropped those and had a normal year for fourth year. So they can only add maybe three extra classes without needing magical help. That's not a lot of options.
