First thing is split the core subjects between two teachers, one for 1-3 and the other for 4-7. The fact that McGonagall is able to teach at least twelve classes per week, manage Gryffindor House, and be the Deputy Headmistress is nuts. Splitting core subjects in half gives you six classes for each. I assume that the electives are just one class per year.

Competent professors for history, potions, and defense are obviously needed. I don't necessarily know that Burbage is a bad teacher, but her subject is just out of date. She has to take into account what's going to be covered on the OWLs and NEWTs and teach that information. Though she died so I guess it's a moot point. I've also thought that Divination should be offered only to those who have the ability, but Trelawney can stay on as an Oracle-in-Residence because I feel sorry for her. Also she threw was dropping crystal balls on people during the Battle of Hogwarts and that deserves some props. For creatures, Hagrid shouldn't be teaching because he doesn't have an OWL in any subject. Hire a teacher for Care, and make Hagrid the Groundskeeper and instructional assistant.

Add in new/better electives. I'm not concerned about subjects that are taught in your typical muggle school. I'm saying let's add an introduction class for muggleborns that covers etiquette, using quills, different forms of transportation, and other basics to the Wizarding world. Let's have NEWT level classes on broomology, enchanting, healing, dueling, international relations, ghoul studies, magical races, ancient studies, Latin (I bet that helps with spell creation), law, alchemy, and magical arts (dance, music, portraits, etc.), and other electives that cover things like estate management, business and finance, an introduction to the Ministry of Magic. There are tons of possibilities.

I'd also look long and hard at making the Head of House position independent of the teachers. Harry's year is supposedly exceptionally small with only forty students. If Hogwarts really has a thousand students like is suggested, that's 250 kids to keep tabs on. That's a full time job in and of itself. They would have to monitor detentions, give career advice and other counseling, oversee prefects and quidditch captains, monitor the academic status of students in the house, handle intra-House discipline, and any number of other tasks.

I think it would actually be kind of interesting to see somebody go through a whole list of things that are needed to upgrade Hogwarts in a methodical, realistic way, and make a story out of it.
