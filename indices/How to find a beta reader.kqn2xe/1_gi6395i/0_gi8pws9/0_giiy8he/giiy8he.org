You're welcome. Good luck with your writing, and your hunt for a beta. :)

Oh, and come to think of it, there's a lot of writing subs and resources around on how to improve your technical writing, so it might be worth posting in those subs (eg. [[/r/writing][r/writing]]) to ask for advice/resources and/or doing searches for tips and resources in subs and generally online to find advice that you might be able to tailor for your own purposes.
