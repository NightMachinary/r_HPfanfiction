As maryfamilyresearch said, you can post here. There's also the weekly beta swap thread on [[/r/Fanfiction][r/Fanfiction]]. Can't remember when it is, but they have a schedule in the sidebar.

If you have strong skin, there's also the Dark Lord Potter forum, which has 'work by author' threads that let the users there read and review your work. They are quite bluntly honest though, so really don't post unless you're thick-skinned.

FFNet also has a beta function (if you check out the top-bar on the website, it's the last option) where you can navigate through the filters to get HP specific betas.

There's probably a few more options too - I've known writers to work together and review each other on discords and yahoo groups and the like - but those are the main ones I know about.
