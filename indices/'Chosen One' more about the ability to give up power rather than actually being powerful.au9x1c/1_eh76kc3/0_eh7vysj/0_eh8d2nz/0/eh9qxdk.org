Yes. I realize too much of a trait could be negative, but I don't really see the persuit of power for the sake of having it or using it to impose your ideals on society as a positive trait - people are imperfect and the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I'd rather hand power to a Harry over a Tom or Dumbledore in most situations because he doesn't already have plans for it.
