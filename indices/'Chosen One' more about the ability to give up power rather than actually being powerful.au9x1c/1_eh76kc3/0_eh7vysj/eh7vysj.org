A lot of people would have done that. It's no different than Harry's friends following him to the Ministry in book 5 or Neville and company actively protecting the younger students in book 7. Wanting to feel in control, wanting to believe that it is your choice is not rare. I get why you think he's awesome for it, I just don't see it as worthy of a one of a kind title and prophecy.

What is rare is having no interest in power even while you have every chance to have it. Harry didn't 'give up' the power associated with being the Chosen One because for him there was nothing to give up, it was something he just didn't have any real interest in. Dumbledore gave up power, Harry didn't see it as worth having in the first place.

How many people would give up the elder wand? Even if I had no plans to use it, I would keep it with me for 'safe-keeping' just to make sure no one else would get it.
