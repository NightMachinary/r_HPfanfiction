This quote from OOTP sums up to me why Harry is The Chosen One.

“It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew - and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents - that there was all the difference in the world.”

From the moment he stopped hiding behind the gravestone and faced Voldemort in GOF he became The Chosen One to me.
