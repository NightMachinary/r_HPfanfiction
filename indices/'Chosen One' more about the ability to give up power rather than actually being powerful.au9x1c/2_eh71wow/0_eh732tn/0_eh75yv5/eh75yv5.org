It happens to everyone don't worry. I think it's interesting that in the books Harry chooses to put the wand back in dumbledore's tomb, it's like he's acknowledging that there are people that are truly powerful in the world instead of dismissing the idea entirely. Harry rejects power but he believe in it which imo is quite a humble characteristic and just makes me love harry even more
