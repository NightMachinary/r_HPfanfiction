What I was implying was that Harry's position was something that he is naturally suited for - he has natural ability in DADA and leadership that kept his promotions steady - but he is/was not actively looking for power/influence in order to fulfill his masterplan for the wizarding world or whatever. Other than not going back for NEWTS (and he wasn't the only one I think a lot of his year had the same opportunity) he refused to use his 'Chosen One' status to get ahead.
