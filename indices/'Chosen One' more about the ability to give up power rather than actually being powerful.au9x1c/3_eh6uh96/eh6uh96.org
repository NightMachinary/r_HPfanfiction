I disagree. Working his way up the Auror command chain exactly signals a Harry willing to take charge and to lead. This allows him to push his agenda and protect his interests with Magical Britain's official security force.

And if you look at what his other close friends are doing, you can see a very clear pattern:

- Hermione is the mastermind and she sets the policies, the overall direction of the country
- Ron runs a super profitable business, and I can bet that WWW is the top Ministry contractor (they were one even in HBP)
- Ginny controls the country's top news channel. Those who dare to defy them get hexed into St Mungos
- Luna controls the country's next largest news channel
- Neville is in charge at Hogwarts and will eventually replace the aging McGonagall
- Of course, Harry himself is charge of the security force and the top protector. He seems to be the top enforcer of Hermione's policies

They have a lock on all top positions in Magical Britain, and that doesn't look to me as “giving up power and retreating into obscurity”.
