But that doesn't work that well if you have Voldemort and his cronies taking over magical Britain. For Harry to have the initiative, he needs to be in a position of relative strength. Sherlock can afford to investigate because he does not have an entire government hunting him while they are running a genocide eerily similar to the Third Reich prior to the Final Solution.

A proactive Harry either needs to have a significant advantage in combat ability or you need to disregard the takeover and its preparation in the last two books.
