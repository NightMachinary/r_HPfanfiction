To be honest, it's quite difficult to pull off a proactive protagonist. It makes sense, given the initial ideas why Harry is that kind of person, and from a narrative point of view it paves the way to 'magic as problems' rather than 'magic as solutions'. (Sadly, only fifth and sixth books did not end with the latter.)
