#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle was once a boy unlike any other in Wool's Orphanage and was content with living his life out there as a freak. However, his hopeless fate soon changed upon the arrival of Frankie Dickson, a girl who was apparently just as freakish as he was. This is a story of a friendship that was to be forgotten by time. For who would believe the future Dark Lord to ever have feelings.
