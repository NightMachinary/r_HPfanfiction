Ok Im not really good at book reviews but.... This story is about Tom riddle falling in love with a girl who came joined him im his hellhole.Its really good because they dont just join the other person when theyre on different sides of the war.Frankie still stays true to her values and Tom stays true to his ambition of killing all mudbloods and muggles.Not to mention the ending!!!!oh my ....Im going to die
