I actually remember reading this, and the biggest appeal for me is the presence of Voldemort in this story in addition to Harry Potter. I had some issues with the pacing and logic used, but I did follow the story. I left a more in-depths review on the specific issues that I personally had.

Overall, though, this is definitely one of the better HP x MHA crossovers, so be proud and keep up the good work.
