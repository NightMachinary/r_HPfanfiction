Since crossovers are scarcer than regular stories, and with a fandom like MHA, where there are so many ideas but also so many characters to love and write about, it can discourage writers, same for Assassination Classroom I think. Just wish there were more stories that aren't shipfic in those fandoms.

Normally I would shamelessly self-plug here, haha, but since my story is still short compared to Whatever It Takes, and you've probably checked out all stories in that section and only found 1 good, meant that you've found my story not up to your standard. That's too bad. I hope we see more from this section in the future.
