It's definitely an excellent read. The narration is so natural and done in such way that it *feels* canon. I found the writing style and the character development similar to Rowling's. It could perfectly be a next gen fic, except for, you know, no having the descendants of the main characters in the story. It just feels like the HP universe a few years in the future, and in America. And the fact that there are 4 books (yes, entire books) already helps with the immersion. The series is planned to have 7 books, just like its canon counterpart, and the author has already confirmed that he has the next couple of books very roughly drafted already, so that's a promise that the series has not been abandoned. I had heard the series was quite good in other recommendations, but I put it off for a long time. When I finally deigned to read it, I went in expecting nothing, and boy, I was thoroughly surprised. Do give it a chance.
