Thanks for the recs! I've read Lily and ABS and found it delightful, so that speaks well for your taste in the other two. Haven't heard of the Pureblood Pretense, but Alexandra Quick has been on my list for awhile and I've never quite been in the mood to start it. Good to know from you and FYI that it's worth pushing through. :)

And I'd say Lily and ABS is probably a bit too close to canon to be what I want - it's more a bizarre HP fic than a not-HP fic, IMO. YMMV and all that though. Maybe I'll change my mind after a reread. :)
