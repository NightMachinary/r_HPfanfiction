Alexandra Quick series definitely, it uses the HP magic system, but the plot and characters, and much of the world building is completely unique. And it's really good. The Pureblood Pretense and Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus are both extremely AU, but they also somewhat follow the stations of canon to an extent, so not sure if they are quite what you are looking for, but are both good.
