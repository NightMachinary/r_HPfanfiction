linkffn(5904185) Emperor, even the names are barely used, like This has a Harry who goes by the name of Francis White, was raised by his parents without contact with the magical world, attended a muggle boarding school while praising his wandless magic which barely has anything to do with the Harry Potter magic system, and most of the fic is how he spend his years after the school serving in the Military while having the goal of becoming the Emperor of Europe.

Surprisingly its still a pretty good story, but its almost entirely an original story to the point that it's barely a fanfic.
