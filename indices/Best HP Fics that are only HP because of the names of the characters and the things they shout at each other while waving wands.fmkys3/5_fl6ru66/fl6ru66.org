linkffn(Voldemort's last spell) fits that perfectly. The main character is Harry who, after being hit with Avada on that Halloween, was transported back in time. Very, very long ago (120000 years ago). To the times when people still lived in tribes. He grows up in one such tribe and then leaves for another because people start noticing that he lives a very long life. And so he wanders the world, immortal. He is the first magical in the world and his green-eyed children are taking after him.

As you stated, this work is HP only because of Harry's name. It's very interesting.
