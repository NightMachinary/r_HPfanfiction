[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][A Second Chance at Life]] and its continuation [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3078469/1/Changes-in-a-Time-of-War][Changes in a Time of War]] seem to be what you're looking for. It's basically Harry Potter not wanting to have anything to do with anything in the HP world. Word of warning, it's all over the top with vampires and demons, blood magic, leather clothes, and everything possible to make themselves as edgy as they could. You have been warned.
