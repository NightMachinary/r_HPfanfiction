A few editor complaints:\\
* the aforementioned disappearing line break in ffnet's editor\\
* also for ffnet, the entire 'upload a full replacement in order to edit a chapter' design\\
* ficwad's tendency to assume that single letters have simply gotten lost and must be reunited with their consonant-safety-buddy (ex.: A friend becomes afriend) Ficwad's editor has many flaws, but this is the most unpredictable one, and requires re-editing a chapter after it's been posted in order to correct it\\
* several editors tendency to concatenate several repeating characters into one; it cramps my style in dialogue

It's worth noting that these complaints have nothing to do with the fandom. I'm actually rather pleased with the scope and diversity of stories that are permitted and enjoyed by so many. There are moments when Envy burbles bile in my throat upon seeing an uninteresting work with 3000 reviews and 10000 follows, but I remind myself that /those readers aren't my target audience/.
