For me, it's when people read an AU plotted fic and must be following the plot and the foreshadowing, but rather than ask about what's been clued to them in the fic, they ask a question about something that advanced the plot in the canon instead, and hasn't been mentioned at all.

For example, having someone ask, "When will Harry find out about Snape's Patronus?" when the Patronus identities have been completely ignored and irrelevant throughout the fic. It's just like someone telling you, "Yeah, I'm reading it, but I haven't been paying attention."
