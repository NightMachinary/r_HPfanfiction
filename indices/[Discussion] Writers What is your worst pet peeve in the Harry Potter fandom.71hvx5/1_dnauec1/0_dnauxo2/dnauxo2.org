I've got people throwing fanon concepts and stuff at me in the reviews as if I'd ever made any mention of them in my story (I haven't), and it really bothers me that they can't just follow the story and not try and dictate /to me/ where it should go. Like, if I wanted to make it a choose-your-own-adventure-style story, I would have, and would have included polls for the readers and shit. It gets on my nerves /a lot/.
