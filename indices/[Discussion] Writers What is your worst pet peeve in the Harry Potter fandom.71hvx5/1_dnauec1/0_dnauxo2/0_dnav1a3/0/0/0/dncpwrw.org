I'm pretty sure it's the world where Ginerva (misspelling on purpose) doses Harry with love potions at the behest of Molly who raped her husband with love potions to produce a magical daughter to ensnare the Boy-Who-Lived with because Dumbledore who is manipulating everyone for the Greater Good told her that and he is her idol and authority and she calls him “daddy” when they are alone.

Yeah, it's the world of that person's weird fantasies.
