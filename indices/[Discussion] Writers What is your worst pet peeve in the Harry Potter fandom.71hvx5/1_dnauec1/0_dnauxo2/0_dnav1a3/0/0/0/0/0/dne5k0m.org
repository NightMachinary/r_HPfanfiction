I'm not sure about returning them, but I would say that the best way to act is probably just to ignore them until they disappear in a puff of (il-)logic.

That said, let's get serious for a moment. I do believe that the people who claim it to be the least likeable pairing aren't looking at pairings in general but merely at the possibilities of how (and with whom) they could pair the main character. Since in a lot of those situations the proposed contender is compared with the status quo (meaning Ginny) when it comes to how they are better, it leads to a situation where it's easy to declare that she is a wrong partner for him in every single way despite it not being true.
