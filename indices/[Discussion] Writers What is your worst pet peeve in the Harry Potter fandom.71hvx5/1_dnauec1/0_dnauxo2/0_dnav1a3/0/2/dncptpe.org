As far as I know, most of the people that have a gripe with the pairing feel that way because Ginny's character development mostly takes place off-screen.

So ... yeah, it's not really a hatred of the pairing as much as it is a vehement dislike of someone who mostly just bloody isn't there for the plot, and I feel that those who actually try to enjoy stories for what they are instead of for whether or not it follows their own image of how everything is are capable of separating the symbol that Ginny was in that pairing with Ginny herself.
