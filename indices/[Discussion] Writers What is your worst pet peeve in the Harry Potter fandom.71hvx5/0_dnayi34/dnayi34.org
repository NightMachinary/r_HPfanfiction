People that don't understand that this is a hobby for me are pretty annoying. I do this for free in my spare time when I feel like it. I recently received a pm demanding to know why I have abandoned my latest work. When I explained that I haven't abandoned it, I am just not up to writing right now, they said that I was letting down my readers. It's just rude.
