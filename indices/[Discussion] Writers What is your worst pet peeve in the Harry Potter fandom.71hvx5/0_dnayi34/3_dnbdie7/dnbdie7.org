That's absolutely rude of them. I will say a minor pet peeve of mine is when an author doesn't finish a story but then I see them posting new stories frequently. This is especially frustrating when they are stories in a long series like Northumbrian and little0bird write.

That said, I'd never feel so entitled as to chide the author or demand anything from them. After all, I knew when I started reading that the story was incomplete. I think it's fair to be upset that a story is unfinished while also accepting that the author owes the reader nothing and is under no obligation to complete.
