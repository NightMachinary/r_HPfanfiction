No. There is no good way to prod.

Your best bet is to write a detailed review as a pm discussing plot points you like and why you like them then at the end saying something like "hope the next chapter is going well" and the author might respond with how the next chapter is going and not find you an annoying pissant.

Most people who send messages wanting updates do so in an annoyingly demanding fashion. And make no effort to engage the author. Personally, I like to talk about my stories. I am also very uninterested in providing someone who has never left a review with a timetable of future updates.

Also if you frequently review you are more likely to get a positive response. Authors recognize tags they see a lot.

And If I'm any indication; I respond to pretty much every PM I get, because I feel like if someone took the time to write something they deserve a response. It's not always super prompt but usually by the end of the week if I'm going to respond. If I respond with one sentence, I was probably annoyed by the message; if I respond with paragraphs, I probably wasn't.
