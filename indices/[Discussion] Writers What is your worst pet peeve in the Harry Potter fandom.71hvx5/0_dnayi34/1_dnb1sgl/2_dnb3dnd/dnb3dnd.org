My two cents as a writer who updates sporadically due to time constraints: the quickest way to usually prod me into action is someone simply telling me how they're enjoying my fic and how they hope I update soon.

Not 'you need/should/have to update' or any other variation of a demand. Just someone saying something that either reminds me and/or reenforces the fact that what I'm writing is being enjoyed by someone so I should get back to working on it.

YMMV of course since every writer or reason for an writer not updating is different but positive or encouraging feedback is rarely a bad thing.
