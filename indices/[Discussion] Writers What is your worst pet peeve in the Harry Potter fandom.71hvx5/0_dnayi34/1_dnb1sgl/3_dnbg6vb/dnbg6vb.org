I think the most decent prodding I've received was by a PM from a reader who wondered about specific unanswered questions -- 'Is this character really dead?' 'How will that affect A, B, C, and oh but that means...' In essence they got me fired up to think about the answers and how the story had been left at a point where the readers can't predict some of my plans.
