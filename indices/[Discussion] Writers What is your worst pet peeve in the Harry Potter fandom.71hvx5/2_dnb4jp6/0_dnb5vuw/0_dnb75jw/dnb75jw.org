I've just taken to leaving a little header under the lines saying the date or location of the coming scene now, like:

*1994, November 24, Girls' Dormitory*

It lets me easily scroll through in the text editor and find where the horizontal lines need to go.

I was thinking of using those symbol separators, but I didn't feel like typing them out every time, and I didn't want to copy it to put it in my clipboard because I already had the dash "---" symbol there, and I use that far more often. It's still a bit annoying though. I also dislike that strike-through gets taken out.
