When I'm obviously changing things up in canon and someone asks why this or that isn't like it is in canon. We would have a shit ton less fanfics if we had to follow canon 100% so just let me write my story, will ya.

When reviews are outright wrong. I had one person complain that it was OOC for my character killing another. I was like wtf are you talking about? No one has killed anyone. I just ended up deleting that review.

Or when I get accused of something ridiculous. This one person accused me of being a homophobic, horny guy who writes femslash and not slash because I find lesbians hot. Not only am I neither, but you'd think I'd have a little something more than "light romance," as I put it, if that was true.

I hate that my horizontal lines get deleted when I upload a document. Going in and putting them all back in again is fucking annoying.
