The thing that most grinds my gears is getting reviews. If I see that a story has gotten a review, I'm probably going to abandon it. I've resolved this by adding an email filter so I don't get notified about reviews, but it annoys me that I can't tell ffn not to send the blasted things in the first place.

ao3 seems better there, though I haven't tested.
