I'm a black belt in karate myself so when I see martial arts being written by someone who clearly hasn't got a fucking clue what they're about I have to either ignore it if the story's good enough or just stop. And you're right, most of the time it's not even relevant because the author just forgets about it or something.

Wand holsters actually do appear in Deathly Hallows Part 1, but as a waist-holster thing which one of the Death Eaters wears when they're searching the Hogwarts Express for Harry. I get why wrist holsters would be handy, but I think at this point I'm just sick of seeing them regardless because they're one of the most-used equipment tropes in HP fanfics.
