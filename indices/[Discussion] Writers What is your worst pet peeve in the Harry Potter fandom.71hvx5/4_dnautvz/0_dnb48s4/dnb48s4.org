OP was asking for the pet peeves of writers. Not like the other pet peeves threads.

The misspelling of names drives me fucking crazy. Especially Lilly.

It's also annoying when Harry doesn't use any of the things he learns. I've read plenty of fics where he learns martial arts, but none of them have him /ever/ use them.

I don't mind wand holsters though. I feel like they'd be something canon would have, and would explain why Dumbledore can have his wand out in a split second. Though, I find the mental image of Dumbledore with a wand holster kinda odd.

I'd end up missing my catch if I ever had one though. I'd flick my wrist or whatever and the damn thing would probably poke someone's eye out.
