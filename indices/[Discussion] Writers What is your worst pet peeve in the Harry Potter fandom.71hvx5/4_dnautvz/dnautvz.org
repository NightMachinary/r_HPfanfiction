Oh, look, another pet peeves thread. Well, might as well contribute.

First is and always will be people misspelling stuff from canon as well as general lack of punctuation and grammar/spelling checks in their work. There are like a bazillion different tools you can use to check what you write, and it's pretty inexcusable to misspell stuff from canon (looking at /you/, Dolores Umbridge).

Second would be people recycling tropes from other stories pretty much in their entirety and adding literally nothing new. At the present a lot of that is centred around A) Daphne Greengrass, B) The Delacours being for some unknown reason really fucking important to France, C) The Wizengamot being the Wizarding government/House of Lords and everyone having "seats", "votes", "lordship rings", "family magic", "alliances between houses like Potter and Longbottom", etc.

Third would be bashing. It's dumb to write a dumbed-down version of a character from canon to illustrate how dumb they are /in canon/. Ron, Ginny, Mrs. Weasley and Dumbledore get the worst of it by far, just because some people can't understand that friends aren't supposed to be 100% sounding boards that back everything you do always and never call you out on your bullshit or, I dunno, have an independent thought once in a while. Manipulative!Dumbledore gets on my nerves here too, but usually because his motivations make literally /no/ sense, and he can only ever act with the skills of a brain-damaged raccoon so that Harry can power-up and beat him down with no challenge for the author's power-wank fantasy. An /actually manipulative/ Dumbledore's machinations would be impossible to detect, and he'd probably end up winning and running off with Harry's money or whatever freely and Harry would be Obliviated, Imperiused, and Love Potioned to the gills. He'd have contingency plans after contingency plans for if shit went wrong and would never be caught with his pants down like in all these stories that feature ol' Manipulative!Dumbles.

Fourth would be people trying to tie actual politics to the Death Eaters, you know, Wizard Nazis. This tends to apply more to American writers as many of them don't look up what being a "Conservative" politician in the UK means before they dub the Death Eaters conservatives, and it just really irritates me because it ends up a whole bunch of weird political grandstanding by people who clearly aren't that interested or informed about actual politics.

Fifth would be the tried-and-tested-and-failed Independent!Harry stories. You know the drill. Sirius has died, leaving all of the main character development already done beforehand, Harry is going through his emo-goth phase when he decides /enough is enough/, and works out, or does martial arts (bonus points if the extent of the author's knowledge of martial arts is a few Jackie Chan movies), goes to Gringotts and is polite to a Goblin and becomes honorary king or whatever and they fall over each other to suck his dick, goes to Diagon Alley and buys a wand with 23 cores, stupid Assassin's Creed wand-wrist-holsters, and a magical trunk that he could live in that is just the most MacGuffin of MacGuffins. Extra bonus points if he is a twat to Ron because reasons, calls Malfoy a ferret, bones Daphne Greengrass, Susan Bones, Tracey Davis, both Patil Twins because they're obviously into incest because twins (this is offensive to me because I /am/ a twin) and Fleur. Extra-extra bonus points if there's a whole load of BS politics in it, taking us right back to point number 2, stupid Wizengamot BS.

Huh, just realised it was for writers. Well, I suppose I don't like reviewers asking stupid questions, or wanting stories to follow their whims, or object to the pairing and make a point of telling you, or just review "moar plox". Those are all pretty unhelpful.
