That the british magical society was basically a Matriarchy. If you genderbend everyone, no exceptions, but leave the world mostly as is, then Britain is primarily ruled and guided by women. Lucia Malfoy, Agatha Dumbledore, Cornelia Fudge,...

I wrote this trope out once and came to the conclusion that to keep the universe mostly aligned, you have to make wizarding culture a matriarchal society. Women take their names over into marriage, they are the "strong ones", they are the leaders and breadwinners. Otherwise, you start with making Lucia Malfoy into Lucia Black and stop at wondering how to explain that the Hogwarts Houses are still named the same.

I stopped because I realized what a massive box I opened there.
