Voldemort's conception would be more readily perceived as the crime it is if it had been Maeander Gaunt getting Tamsin Riddle pregnant by way of a 'love potion'. He'd still have ended up in an orphanage, of course: girls who got pregnant out of wedlock got put in 'psychiatric' institutions - some of them not getting out until the late 80s/early 90s - so the graveyard scene would've been the burial ground of a disused victorian asylum. For that added Hammer House of Horror vibe.
