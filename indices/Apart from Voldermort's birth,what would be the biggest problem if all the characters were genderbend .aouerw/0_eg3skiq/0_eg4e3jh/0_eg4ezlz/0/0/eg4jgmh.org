Well, his father dies in poverty doing his retarded inbred best to provide for his potioned 'bride'. His mother, going home when the potions stop coming, is committed to an asylum as an unwed mother and dies in childbirth there. When he returns to the house at Little Hangleton he only gets to murder his grandparents rather than a clean sweep of two generations of Riddles.

His father got an indigent's Public Health cremation, so no Bone of the Father, but if everything's genderbent, he gets Bone Of The Mother from the burial ground of the asylum she died in, if her family didn't claim her body when notified of her death.
