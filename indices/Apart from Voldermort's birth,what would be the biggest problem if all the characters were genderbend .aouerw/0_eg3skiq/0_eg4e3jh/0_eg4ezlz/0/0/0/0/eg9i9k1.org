A big piece of Voldemort's backstory is him being raised in an institution (and having a problem after 5th year because back then orphanages kicked their charges out at 14, that being the end of compulsory education and the beginning of the requirement to get a job and stop being a burden).

So, no, if we want the same story the elder Riddles are /not/ going to take in their daughter's bastard (as they see it). And Voldemort's mum is going to be a heartbroken new inmate who knows she's not going to be allowed to keep her baby - they made it quite clear to such women that they might be pregnant, but they weren't going to get to be mothers - giving birth with the benefit of 1920s midwifery in an institution that might or might not have the budget for a proper obstetrician in the event of complications. The NHS was 20 years away when Voldemort was born, after all.
