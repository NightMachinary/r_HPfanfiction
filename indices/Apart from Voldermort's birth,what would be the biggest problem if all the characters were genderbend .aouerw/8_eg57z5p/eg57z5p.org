It wouldn't be Harry Potter anymore. It would be Harry Evans.

Unless there was a made up rule that since Leo Evans was a muggleborn, he would have to take up the Pureblood surname of Jamie Potter.

There wouldn't be any Dursleys either. I can't see Violet Dursley doing something untraditional as making her husband take up her surname, unless Peter Evans really hated his family and was willing to do something abnormal to cut ties with them.

As to the Black sisters becoming the Black brothers, maybe the surname issue could be fixed by having male!Bellatrix and male!Narcissa getting betrothed to fem!Lestrange and fem!Malfoy but the families agreed that since male!Andromeda was the eldest and he would get to keep the Black name, then the two younger brothers would take up the name of the families they were marrying into. Somehow the younger two got married first, and then male!Andromeda didn't show up at his wedding, instead eloping with Theodora Tonks and taking up her surname to spite his family.
