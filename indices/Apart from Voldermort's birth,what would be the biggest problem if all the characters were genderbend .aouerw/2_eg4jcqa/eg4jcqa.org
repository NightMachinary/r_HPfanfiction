I wonder if Harry would even get to the Hogwarts Express in year 1. Vernon (who runs the Dursley household) thinks it's funny to strand Harry there and therefore does it. However, if Petunia (Peter?) Evans were the Head of Household and had a huge personal anti-magic grudge, he might elect not to drive his daughter to King's Cross that day.

The Weasley family would have a vastly different dynamic--think of all of those women! I don't know if they would even be in the same circumstances. Would Arthur(a) even want to give birth that many times? Some key characters like Ron and Ginny wouldn't exist in that case. Would Molly (Manny?) prefer a low-wage job where he can pursue his passion? Or would he pick something else? (I am assuming that we retain the patriarchal ideas where mom = stay at home here)

*Not really "problems" but:*

I think Hermione would be perceived differently by the students--less "bossy buck-toothed know-it-all" and more "ugh, THAT guy" or maybe even "wow that guy sure is a whiz"

Draco's behavior would come across as a lot more "queen bee"/cliquey. I'm sure he'd select attractive students to be his goons rather than big, fat ones. So Crabbette and Goyley would be more dumb Slytherin outcasts than right-hand-women, and meanwhile Theo(dora) and Blaise(ley)(?) would be more important to the plot.

The reader might assume that witches can be more powerful in general (Voldemort, the DEs, the Marauders, Dumbledore, the Chosen One). (In canon the over-representation of powerful males isn't super noticeable since there are way more male characters in fiction in general).

Also, for some reason the phrase "the Fat Lord" really has me cracking up and picturing some 4chan denizen... Imagine the Fat Lord guarding Gryffindor's tower... with his neckbeard and cheeto dust. You may enter, m'lady.

Moaning Merton creeping on Harry taking a bath becomes 1000x creepier.

Norbert would be named accurately :)
