  there's however correspondingly a lack of interesting female characters when it comes to the adults, though - imo.

Yeah, you have Lily, Tonks (at least in OotP) and Hermione once she turns 17/18. Bellatrix makes a decent antagonist because she gets things done (unlike literally anyone else), but she isn't exactly a developed character either. Andromeda and Fleur have some potential but need a lot of work from the author to be more than just a trope.
