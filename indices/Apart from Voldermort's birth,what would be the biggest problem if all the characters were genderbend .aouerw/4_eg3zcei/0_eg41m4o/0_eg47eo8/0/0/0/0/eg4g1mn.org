Let's break this up, shall we:

#+begin_quote
  Minerva
#+end_quote

Does absolutely nothing of note. Utterly useless for anything but teaching her subject.

#+begin_quote
  Remus
#+end_quote

A shitty husband who chose to define himself through an illness.

#+begin_quote
  Peter
#+end_quote

Foresaw the conclusion of a war and defected to save his hide. Not what I would call interesting

#+begin_quote
  Tom
#+end_quote

An insane psychopath who stopped being interesting when he victim-blamed his father for being raped.

#+begin_quote
  Lucius
#+end_quote

A sleazy war criminal who bribed his way out of prison. Many blunders and the one plot where he was dangerous was an accident.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore
#+end_quote

Not interesting because he focuses second/third/fourth/fifth/... chances for enemies over protecting his own people. Could be interesting in his youth, but utterly disgusting in the 80s/90s (ten dark years)

#+begin_quote
  Hagrid
#+end_quote

A friendly person without the ability to comprehend danger. Well-meaning, but also constantly endangers Harry and the other students.

#+begin_quote
  Slughorn
#+end_quote

Is to blame for the entire second war by first telling Voldemort about Horcruxes and then telling no one else. The embodiment of nepotism.

#+begin_quote
  Filius; Kingsley; Quirrel; Charlie; Ollivander
#+end_quote

Basically non-existent in canon.

#+begin_quote
  Bill
#+end_quote

Marries a hot woman. Shelters the Trio. Robs graves for a living. Other than that nothing of interest.

#+begin_quote
  Frank Longbottom
#+end_quote

Is comatose for the entire series.

#+begin_quote
  Lockhart
#+end_quote

Unscrupulous fraud

#+begin_quote
  Snape
#+end_quote

Would have been interesting if he had either other motivations than Lily or never joined the Death Eaters.

#+begin_quote
  Neville
#+end_quote

Overused

#+begin_quote
  Ron
#+end_quote

Boring flaws, very questionable thoughts (worries more if Harry banged Hermione than about the whole civil war and genocide going on)

#+begin_quote
  Draco
#+end_quote

Spoiled, racist brat, all bark and no bite, commited countless war crimes and ought to be either imprisoned for life or hanged.

#+begin_quote
  Cedric
#+end_quote

Claims to be about fair play but tells Harry almost nothing in return for being told about the dragons, does nothing to reign in his friends and fans.

Overall, I give you James, Sirius and Moody. And neither of those gets very interesting fanon characterisations, most of the time they are very one-dimensional or the stories have a very boring, cliche plot (which is why I gave up on Marauder era stories).

Now let's see how many downvotes this gets.
