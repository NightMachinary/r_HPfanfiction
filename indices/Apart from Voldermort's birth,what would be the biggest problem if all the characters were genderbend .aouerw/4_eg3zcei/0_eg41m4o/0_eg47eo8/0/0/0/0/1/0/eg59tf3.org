I'm not Hellstrike, but I similarly dislike a lot about canon.

Honestly, I'm sometimes unsure how I ever got into fanfiction in the first place cause I don't have any meaningful love for the books or movies.

I enjoyed them in a normal way when I read them, thought they were alright but never got caught in the hype (I think because I caught onto the HP train too late and none of my friends were into it).

Only once I found fanfiction did I become HP obsessed. At this point I know a lot about the universe, canon and fanon, thanks to fanfiction.

I appreciate canon for introducing me to fanfiction, because I love and enjoy that much much more than it's source.
