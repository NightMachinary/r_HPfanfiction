You seem to equate characters being uninteresting with characters you dislike. I assume any downvotes probably come from your comment not delivering on what it set out to do: WHY are these characters not interesting?

All your reasons for people being "uninteresting" are just character flaws. That makes them /more/ interesting, no? Like Peter "Foresaw the conclusion of a war and defected to save his hide. Not what I would call interesting" you really don't see what's interesting about Pettigrew's character? A Benedict Arnold who is paralyzed by fear but in the end goes on to save the son of the man he betrayed. That's not interesting??

How is Malfoy bribing his way out of a trial less interesting from a character perspective? Just seems like something you don't like.

Also pre-complaining about downvotes is such a Cool Guy ^{^{TM}} move.
