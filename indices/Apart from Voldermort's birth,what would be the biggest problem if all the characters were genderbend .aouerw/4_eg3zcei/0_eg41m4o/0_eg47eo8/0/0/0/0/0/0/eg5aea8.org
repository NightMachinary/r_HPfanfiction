  All your reasons for people being "uninteresting" are just character flaws.

I don't mind flawed characters. I mean, given how much screen time the trio gets, you will find the most character flaws in them. Yet I don't dislike Harry or Hermione, despite their countless flaws.

  How is Malfoy bribing his way out of a trial less interesting from a character perspective?
#+end_quote

Because it was not difficult. If the Ministry was an ironclad organization where corruption was answered with summary executions, or if he was the only one who pulled it off, it would be an outstanding and interesting feat. But given the amount of nepotism we see from Arthur Weasley alone, it was not an interesting achievement.

His actions afterwards are simply stupid. Like, instead of leaving for Bali or Venice Beach, he continues to live as a fucking rat for some reason. Obviously due to the plot demanding it, but that utterly destroyed any interest I have in him. His death is not enough to counteract over a decade of stupidity.
