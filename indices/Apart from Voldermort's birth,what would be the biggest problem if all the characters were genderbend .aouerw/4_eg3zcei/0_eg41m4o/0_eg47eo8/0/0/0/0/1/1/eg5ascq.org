I got into the HP Fandom because I was looking for stories where Ginny was written in an interesting fashion (which to me means her OotP characterisation and a secession from her family). But given that my search was not very successful, I started to look for alternatives. And while most Harry/Hermione stories aren't stellar either, there were quite a few I enjoyed.

I find the universe Rowling created interesting. Her world building is vague enough to leave you a lot of creative freedom, unlike let's say GRRM.

And as anwesend above, I find a good chuck of the female background cast interesting. You have characters like Lavender Brown who fought and most likely died for the cause and yet are almost never on the side of the protagonist. I mean, if you look at my stories, it's basically always Harry centric, Hermione as best friend and then a bunch of background characters like the Tonks, Lavender, Fleur or Pansy (although that one was dictated by the plot I wanted to tell).
