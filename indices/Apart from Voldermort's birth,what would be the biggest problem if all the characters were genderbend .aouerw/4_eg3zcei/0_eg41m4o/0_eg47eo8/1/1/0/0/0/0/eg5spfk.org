Except Ron from Kim Possible isn't a generic kid hero. He's the loveably eccentric fuck-up who can't get anything right but who comes through in the end. He has a PERSONALITY.

Harry... ALMOST has a personality. But comparted to pretty much every other character in the series he's incredibly bland. I'm pretty sure JKR did this on purpose so it'd be easier for the readers to identify with him... but it doesn't make him INTERESTING.
