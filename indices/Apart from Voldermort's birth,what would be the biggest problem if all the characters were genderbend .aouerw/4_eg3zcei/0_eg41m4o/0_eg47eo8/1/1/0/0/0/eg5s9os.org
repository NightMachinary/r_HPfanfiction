Because Harry is very relatable. Unlike, let's say generic soldier 23, he is no macho who kicks arse and chews bubblegum (which can be entertaining, even if not relatable). He is not Barney Stinson or Jon Snow, but he does not need to be.

Harry fucks up in believable ways, his flaws are authentic (even if canon downplays the effects of child abuse) and while generic, he feels like a real person who is completely overwhelmed at times.

It's the same reason why Ron from Kim Possible is such a great side character. He might be generic, but he is authentic.
