Bear in mind, this is all my personal opinion:

You have characters which are interesting based on what is written in canon. Basically Harry and Hermione (at least based on the first five books and a few moments in DH).

Then you have those with interesting implications, like Lily, all three Tonks and (admittedly, I forgot about him earlier) Moody.

After that are the characters which have potential but need some work to be interesting, like Sirius, Fleur and Ginny, who sadly often are fairly one-dimensional.

Bellatrix is a decent antagonist, even if she is one-dimensional because she is dangerous. You can give her an interesting background and make her more tragic (eg maintained a good relationship with Andromeda, slow descent into madness, stuff like that). But in order to be truly interesting, you need her to turn traitor on Voldemort before the DoM battle (after that there is too much water under the bridge). And even then she would be an anti-hero at best.

Then there is a bunch of interesting "what if they got more screen time" characters. That bunch includes Parvati and Lavender, Justin FF (rich Muggleborn as a contrast to Malfoy) and Viktor Krum.

Luna is the odd one in the mix because she works well as a background character but doesn't really work as a protagonist because, in order for her to make sense and be relatable, you need to destroy some of her "Lunaness".
