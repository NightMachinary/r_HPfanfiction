It might be if Ron wasn't so whiney about it and the other brothers were actually decent. I mean, the twins seem to have caused more than one trauma, Percy showed absolutely no interest in his siblings due to different goals in life (until the 7th year at least) and the other two were significantly older and left the country, so I'm not sure how much interactions you would get out of that.

Don't get me wrong, I am a huge sucker for "protective older sibling". But I think a sister would be better suited for Harry because he has a serious lack of positive (older) female figures in his life while Sirius holds down the fort for men.

And lastly, due to the limitations of writing, the Weasleys are an absolutely horrible example for a family because you can at most focus on three or four characters unless you want to move the plot at a snail's pace. I mean, you have Harry (1), Molly and Arthur (2+3), the six/seven Weasley children (4-10/11) and their spouses, which brings us to a score of characters, and that's before you talk about their children. Even if you go with a CoS adoption, you have too many characters to do them all justice. The dialogue tags during dinner alone would be a nightmare.

The one way I see as interesting is Bill taking a bigger interest in Harry and breaking off contact with his family over their treatment of Fleur, but that would be far from "childhood with brothers" and more akin to "mentor couple".
