The thing is, pretty much none of the other Weasleys is ever properly fleshed out, not even Ginny (or rather she is established in a certain way in OotP and then HBP shits all over that but offers no depth to fill the void it created). Yet canon is restrictive enough to give you little room to really work with and carry some rather challenging burdens to write around (Molly makes empty promises about Harry and the Dursleys and produced rape drugs, Arthur breaks his own laws)
