Male ones you have Harry (duh) and Ted Tonks due to the shit his marriage undoubtedly caused and the massive balls that stunt required. That's it.

Neville is the walking embodiment of "you just needed some confidence", Ron is utterly unrelatable to me since I am a single child (and has very dubious priorities in the last book; his "redemption" arc feels very forced), the Twins used children as test subjects without medical personnel nearby, Arthur has forgotten about the concept called "reading a book", Cedric did not reign his house in when they were ganging up on Harry (and he could have succeeded if he really tried).

The Death Eaters are magical Nazis who only succeed if their opposition is either utterly incompetent or sympathises with them. They are not interesting, the canon interpretation even makes rather poor antagonists. Malfoy is a spoiled brat who is all bark and no bite, Snape is boring because everything he does comes back to the woman he threw away and then not only destroyed the last bridge but nuked the whole area (figuratively) by joining the very ideology which caused the damage.

So who exactly is left? Fudge? Scrimgeour? Dean Thomas?

I mean, I don't mind flawed characters, but what the male characters offer aren't interesting flaws. Fan favourites like Snape, Lupin and the Malfoys are shite if you look under the surface and not exactly complex characters either. Snape would have had some potential if he really had a change of heart either after the worst memory or after Lily died - but he is simply obsessed with Lily and James, to a point where it stops being interesting and is plain boring instead.
