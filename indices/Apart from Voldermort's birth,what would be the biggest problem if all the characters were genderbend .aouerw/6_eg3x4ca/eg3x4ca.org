Well, I'd say last names, simply because Canon follows a more patriarchal system than not, but that doesn't add /too/ many problems that can't be fixed with an authorial hand wave. But other than that? Well, the Death Eaters would mostly be made up of women, sans Voldemort's "boy-toy", which might have some less-than-savoury implications. But then again, with most of the positions of power already filled with women, maybe it not be /too/ big of a deal...

But personally, the biggest problem for me when reading a fic like this would be memorising /all/ the names. Who's who, how are these people similar to their canon selves, how are they different, et cetera. It took literal years for me to get to the point where I know who Miriam Strout and Frank Bryce are off the top of my head; I'd go mad trying to figure out and remember their genderbent counterparts.

Not to mention that as an author coming up with the names would be hell in and of itself.
