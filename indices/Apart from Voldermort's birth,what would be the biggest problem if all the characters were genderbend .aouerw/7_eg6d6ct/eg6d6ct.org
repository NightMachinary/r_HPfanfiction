I don't subscribe to the idea that people who are attracted to someone would be equally attracted to their genderbent equivalent, even if they themselves had been genderbent. Growing up as a boy instead of a girl introduces more than enough variables to have entirely different romantic parameters.

So basically none of the characters we know would exist in that world, because people would started to marry entirely different people, since whenever that genderbending thing started to happen.
