  I think James and Lily's love story would be interesting if it was Jamie Potter and I don't know, Luke Evans. Evans could still think Potter was a spoiled brat, and Potter would still have an embarrassing schoolgirl crush.

Most guys would not turn away a pretty girl throwing herself at them, especially not with teenage hormones thrown into the mix. I mean, defending your friend sounds great, but I think most would forget about that if her rival stood naked in front of you and went for your pants. And "the naked man" sounds like something FemJames would pull since there would be little possible backlash (and no teenage boy would like to admit to turning away a shag, especially not when you grew up during the sexual revolution/liberation)
