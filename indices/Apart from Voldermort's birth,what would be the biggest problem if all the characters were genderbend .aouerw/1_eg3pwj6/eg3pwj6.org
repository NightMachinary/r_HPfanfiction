I really like Harry-as-a-girl stories when done well, but I think Voldemort would have gone for Neville in that case.

​

But that's not if all the characters were gender bent, just Harry.

​

Hmm.

I think James and Lily's love story would be interesting if it was Jamie Potter and I don't know, Luke Evans. Evans could still think Potter was a spoiled brat, and Potter would still have an embarrassing schoolgirl crush.
