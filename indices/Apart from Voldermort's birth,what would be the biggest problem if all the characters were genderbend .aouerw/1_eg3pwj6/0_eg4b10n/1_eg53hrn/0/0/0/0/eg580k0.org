I love the Snape fanart you've linked. I think so often fanon likes to picture him as a [[https://womenwriteaboutcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/buckybarnes1.jpg][sexy dude with long hair]] rather than a pale goth, as you say.

I couldn't even being to think how to write a fem!Snape. It'd be very difficult.
