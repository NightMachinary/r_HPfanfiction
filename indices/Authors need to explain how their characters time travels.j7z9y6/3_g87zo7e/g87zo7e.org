I totally agree. People seeing as over explaining, but it is part of the plot. I do a bunch of time travel, and usually I go for the time turner. However, I try to explain how people got to the time turner and where did they ended and stuff like that... Some other times I use different things that make sense.

It is ground work but I am of the idea that it has to be done.

One reviewer once asked why I was writting 5 chaps before the actual time travel, that it was slow, that should have started with the guy in the past... IMO doing that would have been like JKR starting HP1 with Harry already at Hogwarts and explaining first chaps through flashbacks.
