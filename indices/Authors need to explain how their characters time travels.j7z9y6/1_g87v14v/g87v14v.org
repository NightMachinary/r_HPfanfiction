I disagree with your opinion. IMO whenever author tries to explain why the mc time traveled, he is likely to mess up and the reason is something stupid.... Very rarely have I found an adequate reason for time travel to work, most involving a botched ritual and a time turner.

After a while this totally plausible reason would feel like a clich√© and thus bland, so please don't try and explain the reasons why.

In canon tons of shit happens to Harry which would be unbelievable otherwise but we never seem to question it, so let's continue doing so with this as well
