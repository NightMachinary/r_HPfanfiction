Firstly, how do you reference some1 else's words when you comment?

I think I'll begin my defense with harry surviving as a kid, Lily can't have been the first mother to have sacrificed herself for a child, or the first parent honestly. Yet it's harry who gains a ultimate hax in terms of protection.

In the mirror room quirrel who with a snap of his fingers can bind harry with ropes ultimately goes for grappling like a muggle quick kicks in said protection.

Harry being a parselmouth. And yes I've heard the explanation of the piece of soul in his scar, but I call bullshit... A genetic quirk cannot be influenced by spiritual event.
