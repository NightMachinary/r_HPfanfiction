The only fic I can think of that is similar to what you're describing is linkffn(10724291). Harry is a magical creature and has been sent back in time, but he's de-aged. He's supposed to fulfil a prophecy that will see magical creatures shift to the top of the world order, and is considered a Lord amongst magical creatures. His usual gang are present but don't play a very significant role. And I'm not sure, but I think that one of his main ideas for fighting the war is to let Voldemort and Dumbledore fight it out before taking over.

It's also Voldemort/Harry slash.
