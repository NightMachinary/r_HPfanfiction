might try linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen)

Harry is so magically screwed after a time jump he passes out when he waves his wand in Ollivanders. He's still pretty bad ass but.. magically gimped for sure.

Another one is linkffn(A Switched Chance) Harry and Hermione time jump but end up in each other's body, with each other's magic. I thought the writing about body/mind/soul/magic was more interesting than average.
