I currently try my hands on one of those. Its a HPxFairytail crossover where he soon finds out that Fiendfire is fine and all, but Natsu does the same damage with a sneeze, that Aguamenti is Juvia being a bit moody and in general his magic is not exactly on par with the sheer devastation a FT mage can summon. Harry has to become increasingly creative with his spellcasting, especially when he meets the enemies of Fairytail.

Naruto crossovers also seem to have an increased amount of low-power Harry's, if you want to investigate in that avenue.

If you write this make sure to post it here for all to see.
