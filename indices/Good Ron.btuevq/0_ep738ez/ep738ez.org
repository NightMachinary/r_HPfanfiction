I want to make it explicitly clear that this is pulled directly from the author's notes, and that I am not the author, because I wasn't clear enough when I posted this on a different thread and got praise I don't deserve.

  Second, I also wanted to write something without completely hating or cutting out Ron. The idea of him being a part of the story is thanks to several stories I read.

  More and more, this evolved into the concept of trying to write a Ronald Weasley that wasn't an idiot, that wasn't after Harry's gold, and that wasn't the boring cliche he's turned into in most stories these days. Chilord's Sekrit project was a significant inspiration. It certainly got fun to write after a while, but I don't believe we've agreed upon whom we could possibly pair him with. The idea of Hermione following them across words, appearing with her fist on her hip and waving a finger at the two of them was appealing for about two seconds, but I'm pretty sure that won't be happening in this story quite like that.
