Just finished reading this one-shot, set post DH:

linkffn(Number Games by jbern)

For longer fics with a nonbashed Ron, I really like the ones where he goes back in time.

linkffn(the cost of time travel) has an adult Ron who travels back in time but would much rather remain in the future. Has some interesting ideas, especially in the later chapters. Sadly abandoned.

linkffn(The Red Knight) Is a WIP with a similar premise, except that Ron doesn't end up in the same universe that he came from. Decent writing quality.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die]]) is Harry-centric, but Ron is loyal to him to the core. Cracky. Very Cracky. Also complete!
