First off, second "The Sum of Their parts" and "The Red Knight", linked elsewhere in this thread.

I also seem to recall Weres Harry having an interesting Ron, with Daphne's father being coach for the Canons... linkffn(8106168)

If you have any interest in reading Harmony pairings, it is very hard to find them with a decent Ron. For Hogwarts era fics, it is quite rare, usually the best you can hope for is him simply being put on a bus.

You have massively AU fics (Harry grew up with the Weasleys! Hermione was sorted into Slytherin!) that can easily fit the bill.

For more Canon compliant fics, they basically have to diverge forth year or earlier. Starting fifth year the "Ron's insecurity over his relationship with the trio" has been so established that any h/hr is gonna portray him negatively. Or at least require a lot of character development to work through the issue, something most h/hr fics do not want to give the character.

Only one that comes to mind is:

Stages Of Hope is AU H/Hr with positive treatment of all Canon protagonists (Ron, Luna, Neville) linkffn(6892925)

Edit: Nope! I had seemed to recall Ron being in it but he isn't. Well, not alive anyway.
