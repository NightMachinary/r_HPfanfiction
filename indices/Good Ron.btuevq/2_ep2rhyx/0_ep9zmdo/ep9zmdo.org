I have some opinions for the Sum of Their Parts, I read a few chapters and I thought got me to stop reading because what they're doing is stupidly reckless. I mean, Potter is an ancient and noble house even if they aren't in the 28, they have a Wizengamot seat. And Sirius left him all the Black fortune stuff, well, you know that the Blacks are the strongest of all 28 ancient and noble houses, combined with the Potter fortune they can build a literal political empire. Harry could've easily used his Slytherin side, accept the god damn blasted seat, and vote to kick those 3 dark houses out of Wizenmagot, and enough of bribery would be able to kick them out of the Ministry, as well as do a thorough investigation about their finances and statuses. It will get them kicked out of the Minsitry and their spies inside would be revealed too, isn't this a better way of doing things?
