I know that, but James was hiding and it was dark times you expect him to show up in the meetings while going under the fidelius? Nuh uh! Potters aren't included inside the Ancient and Noble 28 but they still are Ancient and Noble unless you call Peverell not ancient then yeah they still are an Ancient and Noble house. Even if the Potters didn't have a seat, there's still the Black seat Harry needs to take over so it still works.
