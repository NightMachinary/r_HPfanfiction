My top 3 Ron fics:

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: If you don't mind sci-fi AUs, you will find it a great read. The Trio is totally awesome and Ron is a model boyfriend here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]]: A more brave and cunning Lucius Malfoy managed to take over Magical Britain after Halloween 1981. Dumbledore evacuated to France with his remaining followers, but they would have their revenge 18 years later. The main story is about Ron and Hermione, and their challenges in a brutal three sided war.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]]: After being failed again, Harry and his friends declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. Interestingly, Ron and George, not Hermione, are his most resolute supporters right from the beginning.
