There's this really nice one shot somewhere that I can't remember the name of, but it's got Harry and Daphne but Daphne's just this ice cream nerd and it's the sweetest fic I've ever read. Honestly. It's really great and plays on the whole "ice queen" ridiculous trope by showing she's just this nerdy awkward dork that has a hard time with people, but ice cream melts her heart.

I'm still overdosing on sweetness from that fic, if you can't tell.
