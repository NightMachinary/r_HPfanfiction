A book hangover (or fic hangover in this case) is real! It's how I know I've read something special.

After this happens I usually take a small break (going for a walk to decompress helps) and then after a day or so start something completely different. Besides fanfiction I also read a lot of novels, varying from YA to literature. I also read non-fiction, which is usually a good way to ease me out of a hangover since it's not structured around a plot in the same way as fiction usually is. Social interaction can also help me to get my head out of the story, and after that I feel more ready to start a new book/fic.
