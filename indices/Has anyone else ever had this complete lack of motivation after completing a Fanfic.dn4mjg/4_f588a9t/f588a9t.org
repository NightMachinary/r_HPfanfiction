I get it after fics that only defeat Voldemort. Like after all this time and these characters I want and need more! Especially if I've spent over 300k words on a new life for the characters just ending with school leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. Makes me feel like life should stop after school or what happens after is of no consequence.
