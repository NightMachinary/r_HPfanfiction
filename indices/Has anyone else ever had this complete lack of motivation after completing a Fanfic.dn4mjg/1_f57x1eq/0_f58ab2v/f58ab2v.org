I think it's not common in fanfics because they are the fix for that withdrawal from a fandom. You know the originals and are there for a fix. You need some more of that good stuff.

Obviously a well written fic will leave you wanting more of the same, or with the dreadful realisation that you only have three chapters left, but the mindset with fanfics is different to the one with original works IMO.
