The problem with A Cadmean Victory is that it sets the bar too high. But don't lose hope. I've found myself in the same situation as you several times. The trick is to actually launch yourself to the next fic with abandon. I usually start reading thinking they're not gonna be as good as the one I've just read, but often find myself immersed in that new fic's world and I invest myself in it. It usually does the trick. If you want to find good ones you can always search recommendation threads in this subreddit and save the most popular recommendations for when you finish your current one. I actually have a "stash" of fics saved for this purpose precisely.
