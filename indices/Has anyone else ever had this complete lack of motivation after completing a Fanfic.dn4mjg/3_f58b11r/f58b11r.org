1. Start writing your own fic. Think of what you liked and disliked (not necessarily in the same fic). Maybe there is a point where the plot went right but you wonder what would have happened if it went left. Explore that. Sometimes, a oneshot is enough to explore a possibility, sometimes it takes more.

2. Read something from another fandom. Or even an original work. The change of topic, themes and tropes is refreshing.

3. Do something with other media. Watch a movie. Binge a series. Play a video game. A short break with a contrast to what you have been reading will give you a different perspective and you might want to read something specific afterwards. Eg you watch Game of Thrones and then look for a Lord Potter fic (and weep because none can hold a candle to the political intrigue and brutal dream crushing of GRRM).
