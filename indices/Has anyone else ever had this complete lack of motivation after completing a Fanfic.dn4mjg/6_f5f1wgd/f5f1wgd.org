Oh I get that SO MUCH. I'm still not over the fact that I can't find very good sci-fi stories anymore ever since reading an awesome one 3 years ago. It hurts so much because the story was so good but now I've finished it every other story of that genre feels like watery trash.

It makes me really upset because sci-fi is my faveourite genre! I wish there were more really good AND unique sci fi stories!
