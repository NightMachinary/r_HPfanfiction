The supposed Sword of Gryffindor is a style that was developed several centuries after Godric Gryffindor's life. That sword was a fancy and expensive tool commissioned by Alfsige Runcorn in an ancestry claim in the mid-16th century, who made a generous show of returning the blade to Hogwarts to protect the castle from invaders.

Godric Gryffindor was not a vaunted fighter. While competent at combat, his true strength was as a diplomat, so well regarded for his strength of character and honor that even families feuding for generations would sit under his roof to broker peace. To this end, Gryffindor enchanted his dagger used for blood oaths to permanently harm the wielder if they would betray the oath. As the centuries passed, the enchantments were bolstered by Hogwarts' wards to a dangerous degree.

The dagger wound up in the teacher's lounge, where Minerva McGonagall greatly enjoys mocking the other professors for never being able to find the communal letter opener.

Harry comes across the dagger when he's walking around the teacher's lounge, and doesn't think much of it. It is, after all, just a letter opener and thus much less interesting than Flitwick's new invention sitting on a display table.

In seventh year (because DH was a stupid tent plot and anything else is better), Voldemort attacks the castle. In the battle, the teacher's lounge collapses and falls on Harry and Voldemort, breaking Harry's wand. Trapped with no way to escape, Harry remembers the letter opener in the cabinet.
