The first time he stepped into the teachers' lounge, Harry got a shock.

Snape was up on a stage, singing karaoke and doing a damn good job.

Flitwick was dancing behind a bar, making various exotic drinks.

Sprout was at a large grill, making something that seemed quite popular, judging by the orders on a rotating clipboard.

McGonagall was at the bar with a wee dram and a bookie's hat on.

Dumbledore was checking a moonshine still.

Harry looked at all this, thought about what he'd eaten for breakfast, and wondered if Luna had found a bad batch of Finnish Blue-glowing Mushrooms in the Forbidden Forest.

He glanced at the class schedules he had in his hands, the nacho cheese fountain in the corner, and the large vat by Dumbledore that Flitwick was glancing at, and wondered what he'd gotten himself into.

He shuddered to think what Tom Riddle had in his lair.
