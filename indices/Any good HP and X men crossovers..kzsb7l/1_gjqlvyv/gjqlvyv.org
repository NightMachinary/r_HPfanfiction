linkffn(9443327) : A Third Path to the Future

Harry ends up in the Negative Zone and is found by Reed Richards. Ends up with the X-Men for a time and then gets involved in other things. OP Harry after a while, but fun. Harry/Ororo/Jean/Emma, if you care about that sort of thing. Later, Hela joins them.

linkffn(13326497) : Post-Apocalyptic Potter From a Parallel Universe

Voldemort destroys the world, and tries to jump to another. Harry follows him, and kills him. It's the Marvel Universe. More of an Avengers thing, but there is some interaction with the X-Men. Harry/Black Widow, if you care about that sort of thing.
