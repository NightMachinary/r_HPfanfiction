There is so much wrong with this.

- James didn't treat Lily like property. I've seen classmates who are more possessive of people they're trying to go out with. In fact, Snape is probably more possessive of Lily.
- Mudblood is the magical equivalent of the n-word. there is a difference between persistently asking someone out and calling your best friend a racial slur
- the Mudblood event was the last straw. Canonically, Lily just gets tired of defending Snape when he doesn't care too much for her
- your description reads like a bad marauder bashing fic
