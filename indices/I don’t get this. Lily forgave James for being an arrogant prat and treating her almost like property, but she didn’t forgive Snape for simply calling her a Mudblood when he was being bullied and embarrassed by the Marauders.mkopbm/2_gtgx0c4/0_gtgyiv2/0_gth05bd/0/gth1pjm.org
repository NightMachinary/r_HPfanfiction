Of course I wouldn't kill innocent people. You know? I didn't think of it at the moment I wrote that. I just try to put myself in his shoes. He would be happy to kill any of the Marauders if he could or simply those from the Light side that made his life miserable. Would you like to fight along people that almost killed you? Depending on how much he wanted it, he could have simply join the other side for revenge. It's just my theory.

Just to clarify this, I'm not saying any of the sides are good. They both have some level of evilness. Personally, I think that the best thing Snape could have done was becoming Neutral in the war and/or leaving the country to focus on his career as a Potion Master.
