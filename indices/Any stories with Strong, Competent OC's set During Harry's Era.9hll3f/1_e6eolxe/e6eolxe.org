There's linkffn(Harry Potter and the boy who lived) which has a very solid set of OCs and is set in durmstrang but sadly abandoned

There's also linkffn(Blood of the Phoenix) which is a bit romancey but it's not over the top with one of the MCs being a well written OC.

Also linkffn(Word Vomit, overly Angsty, poorly written piece of garbage)
