a clever little kid, who believed in a thousand year old monster under the school, could make a leap that included a snake with powers no-one knew it had and just happen to be right. things like that don't prove dumbles was plotting and confunding everyone the whole time. harry remained at the dursleys because the ministry is run by death eaters and evil-morons. most magical people are dickheads; which is cannon. i think jk abstractly says this wizard is powerful and a lot of people perceive him writing out magical code-like language into the walls in phoenix sperm over his school and wondering why the fuck he doesn't swish a spell to determine the truth of all things. it probably just means he knows some clever magic and is good in a duel. also, they all seem to be stuck in the last century and people were idiots back then.
