In terms of what Rowling intended, Dumbledore is most certainly not evil or manipulative. Some of his actions and lack of actions aren't really possible to explain, other than from a meta sense in that if things were different the plot wouldn't work. So from that you can instead explain it by making him evil/manipulative like in fanon, but that was pretty clearly not what was intended by the author.
