The core problem is that we look back at what Dumbledore did and why, and what came of it, and it doesn't seem obvious in hindsight that it would work.

Did he somehow test the Master of Death effect? Did he put a compulsion on the snitch so Harry would keep it with him? Did he implant a suggestion in Harry's mind with Legilimency so he would figure out how to open it? How did he ensure that Harry would survive long enough -- that no one else would kill him? Or did he trust in the prophecy instead?

In order to have /any/ hope that Harry would succeed, he would have needed to be manipulative. But that would only have provided a small shred of hope. And all along the way, Dumbledore had to know he was risking the entire country, possibly the whole continent, on a toss of the dice. On a /hunch/.

It's much easier to get an evil, /incompetent/ Dumbledore that's similar to canon. Dumbledore wants Harry dead for reasons, but the prophecy means it's impossible for him to do it. So he engineers situations to get Harry and Voldemort in the same room together and hopes that Harry dies. But somehow neglects to remember that he could simply forward Harry's home address to Lucius Malfoy.

I suspect there's potential for a comedy in here somewhere, with Snape as the loyal and competent minion and Dumbledore being all "that's not how we do things".
