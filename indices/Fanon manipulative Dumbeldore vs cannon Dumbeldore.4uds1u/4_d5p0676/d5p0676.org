  Are there any indications in the books that Dumbeldore is manipulative or evil
#+end_quote

Yes, but they are almost definitely not Rowling's intention. I have a list of fanon stuff that seems to suppor the evul manipulator theory

* First book
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: first-book
  :END:

- Gets raised ignorant in such a way that he doesn't value his own life and the magical world is seen as an escape

- First contact with the magical world is with an extreme Dumbledore-supporter who won't shut up about what a great man he is

- For some reason Dumbledore has Harry's vault key and invisibility cloak (doubtless for evil and devious reasons)

- He isn't told about the entrance to the train platform and conveniently the friendly and Dumbledore-loving Weasleys are there to help for some reason using the muggle entrance and shouting about muggles and the location of the platform

- He is immediately biased against Slytherin house by ron (an obvious plant by dumbledore) and Hagrid.

- Dumbledore warns all the students not to go to the third floor corridor but the simplest way to get somebody curious about something is to conspicuously forbid it.

- Snape is used to make sure that Harry is kept humble and pliable

- Dumbledore maliciously uses the Mirror of Erised in order to find out the deepest and most desperate desires of Harry's heart to be better capable of manipulating him (presumably using legilimancy)

- Dumbledore travels from scotland to London by broom to give the his plots time to unfold instead of just apparating

- The defences of the Stone are perfectly tailored for the trio of friends that formed.

* Second book
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: second-book
  :END:

- He convinces Lockhart to become the defence teacher which isn't necessarily manipulative but it's definitely evil
- Harry is shunned by everyone and Dumbledore does nothing to get rid of the rumours that he is trying to wipe out the filthy mudbloods
- There is absolutely no way in hell that Dumbledore didn't know that the beast was a basilisk
- Dumbledore saves Harry's life last minute in the chamber even though he shouldn't have any issue just having Fawkes bring him along and deal with that stuff himself

* Third book
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: third-book
  :END:

- Isn't it suspicious that Sirius Black got no trial at all and wasn't even interviewed about what he saw as a first responder to the scene of the greatest magical mystery ever? Clearly Dumbledore used his considerable authority to push Sirius into Azkaban to make sure Harry didn't have anyone to care for him other than abusive muggles
- Dumbledore could have just borrowed Hermiones time turner and summoned pettigrew as a rat to him after he ran off (He didn't because that would give Harry a Godfather to look after him and he has to live with the muggles because of blood magic or something)

* Fourth book
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: fourth-book
  :END:

- Dumbledore uses Harry as 'bait' to catch the person who tried to get Harry to compete instead of just telling Harry not to compete like a reasonable person, there must be a hidden agenda!
- Dumbledore does nothing to help Harry during the tasks
- Dumbledore does nothing to convince anyone that Voldemort is back (pensieve memories or veritaserum or just faking a death eater attack with some order members would be enough)

* Fifth book
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: fifth-book
  :END:

- The blood magic now does nothing to defend against Voldemort anymore and didn't really do anything to defend Harry from outside danger anyways but we should definitely let him stay there with no protection for reasons
- Dumbledore does not explain the connection to Voldemort
- Snape is assigned to teach Harry occlumancy but probably just tried to use the connection to read Voldemort's mind instead
- Harry is finally told of the Prophecy after there is no way to keep him ignorant any longer

* Sixth book
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: sixth-book
  :END:

- Harry is finally going to be given special lessons to defeat Voldemort... oh wait they are useless history lessons because Harry isn't supposed to fight Voldemort, he has to die

* Seventh book
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: seventh-book
  :END:

- Snape literally says that Harry is raised like a lamb to the slaughter
- Dumbledore has had an item (the light put-outer) that could listen in on any conversation that Harry has had since the Halloween Voldemort attack when he was one year old

This is all from memory so there are bound to be tons of examples that I missed and the actual plot of Harry Potter is a bit of an impenetrable clusterfuck so I don't even know if any of that made any sense.
