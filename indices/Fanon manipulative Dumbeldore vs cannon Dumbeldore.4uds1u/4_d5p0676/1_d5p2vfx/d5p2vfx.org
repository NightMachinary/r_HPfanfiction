I'm pretty sure you're being sarcastic, but most of this actually happens. Not because Albus is an evil dark Lord, but to further his plans. Albus actually disowns the "For The Greater Good" philosophy, but he is a proponent of "The end justifies the means" most of the time. On the other hand he tends to give second chances. He's a flawed and well-written character. I still don't like him, but I despise him more if he's just absurdly evil and asinine in a fic. My favorite manipulative Dumbledore is from linkffn(The Well Groomed Mind). And also I like him in linkffn(Itachi is that a baby?) but mostly because he's hilarious and doesn't give a fuck.
