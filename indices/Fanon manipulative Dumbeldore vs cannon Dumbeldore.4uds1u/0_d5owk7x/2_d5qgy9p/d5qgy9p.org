This is a great response, but...

  Dumbledore WAS manipulative. He saw to it that Harry was raised far away from the Wizarding world. He wanted to make sure that Harry didn't get an inflated head early on. Someone with a huge sense of self-importance wouldn't be as willing to choose the path of self-sacrifice or being helpful as would someone who's well aware of the limitations of his abilities and self.

  Just when shit got real around book 5, Dumbledore peaced out

I was on board until these paragraphs.

I do not think Dumbledore made plans based on the type of person Harry is /until/ Half-Blood Prince.

I know this is such a widely accepted theory, but I just don't see the evidence at /all/. I think Dumbledore /had/ plans, but they were not related to the type of person Harry was and especially not related to him sacrificing himself, because the plans involving Harry's sacrifice depended on things he didn't know about until after Harry returned to the Wizarding World, and is especially dependent on Voldemort having taken Harry's blood.

I think Dumbledore was still collecting information when Harry was a baby, but because he seems so smart and all knowing we think he always knew what to do that it's difficult to imagine a time he didn't have a plan, and so the actions he takes based on guesses and more importantly his inaction based on lack of information look confusing and intentional when really he just /didn't know/ what to do.
