Here's the thing. Good writing has characters that are multi dimensional. Having one character be the epitome of good with no flaws would make for boring reading. Having a character have no motivations for their evil would be boring reading. Humans are complex, and have many layers.

Rowling did the thing where she wrote in subtle clues about a character in the character's actions. For example, you see Ron eating copious amounts of food. Where did Ron grow up? At the Burrow, where there were FIVE brothers ahead of him. I know a guy who had a similar situation (his parents are devout Catholic), and he does the same thing. Part of it is because the mother is constantly like "Eat, eat, eat!" Part of it is that if you don't load up your plate early on, you won't get enough of the thing you like. You'll always get enough /food/. But there are certain things that you prefer that you won't get a chance at if you don't load up early and get it down your face hole.

She never explicitly mentions why she's making Ron that way, but it's clear to anyone who knows people from large families that the sort of thing tends to happen.

Same goes for Albus. He's an overall good character, but has things about his personality that come from his history, his upbringing, and various other things that you don't quite put together until you read the last book. Yes, he wants to defeat the evil of Voldemort. Yes, he should have given Harry more information earlier on. Yes, it was a shit move to not let Harry choose for himself the path of fighting Voldemort.

However, I don't know that I'd see those actions as explicitly manipulative, as much as I see it as part of the guy's character. He's the oldest son of a family where one of the children had problems early on. He'd have had to grow up entirely way too quickly. His boyfriend ended up being evil, and sort of crazy. He killed Grindewald. He has had to make choices, over and over again, that sacrificed his needs and well-being for the immediate, pressing needs of the people around him.

Part of the burden of having such great power at your beck and call is that you have to use it to protect the innocent, and those who can't defend themselves. You start seeing it as the default way to think, live, and be.

Like any parent figure, Dumbledore did exactly what he thought was best for his charges. Like any parent figure, Dumbledore made mistakes. He's a complex character.

Now take that character, and put him in the hands of someone who's not a skilled writer. You get the person writing Ron as a glutton, who thinks about nothing but food all day. It's not that Ron is a glutton; he's interested in many things, but will eat heartily when food is in front of him. It'll take Hermione, who loves to learn new things, and read, and turn her into an insufferable, smug know-it-all. She was never smug in the books, but rather (frequently) exasperated and frustrated that others didn't see the most basic (to her mind) things that were staring them right in the face. You take Dumbledore, and turn him into some kind of evil spider, sat in the middle of his web, pulling the strings of everyone around him.

Dumbledore WAS manipulative. He saw to it that Harry was raised far away from the Wizarding world. He wanted to make sure that Harry didn't get an inflated head early on. Someone with a huge sense of self-importance wouldn't be as willing to choose the path of self-sacrifice or being helpful as would someone who's well aware of the limitations of his abilities and self. Look at Draco Malfoy. It took him until book 6 to realise that he was in WAY over his head. That one was raised with the thought that he was hot shit, and something special. He behaved like it too.

Just when shit got real around book 5, Dumbledore peaced out, and didn't have any contact with Harry. By this point, he had to let Harry see the depths of what happens when someone who thinks she's doing it for everyone's own good starts to drink her own kool-aid. Or, he was protecting his own hide. Or, he was literally unable to do anything else.

The thing about someone's motivations and thought processes is that you can't quite know exactly what it is until after the person examines it, and tells you what it is. Unfortunately, a poor writer will see that, and be ham-fisted when it comes to the characterisation.
