  Dumbledore WAS manipulative. He saw to it that Harry was raised far away from the Wizarding world. He wanted to make sure that Harry didn't get an inflated head early on. Someone with a huge sense of self-importance wouldn't be as willing to choose the path of self-sacrifice or being helpful as would someone who's well aware of the limitations of his abilities and self.

I think the debate usually revolves around interpreting this behaviour as either that of a good parent or a callous authority figure. I've seen strong cases made either way.
