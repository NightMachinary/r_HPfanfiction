Exactly! But why can't it be both, you know? How many times do parental figures blatantly manipulate their children? They impose their religious beliefs on the children. They force the children to participate in activities that the children want nothing to do with. They try to influence their children to go into the same profession. Any parent is going to be manipulative at best, and downright controlling at worst.

Which way do you lean, by the by?
