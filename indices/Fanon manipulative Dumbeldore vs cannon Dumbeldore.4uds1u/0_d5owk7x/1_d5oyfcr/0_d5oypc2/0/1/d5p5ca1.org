Oh I'm with you.

But I'd personally compare it more to the patriotism that invariably happens during a major war. Like, look at World War I and II. Any person who'd not want to join up to the military would be seen as weak and unpatriotic. Pretty damn near all the parents around that time would have Strongly Encouraged their children to go join the fight, regardless of the risk to life or limb. You can probably bet your buttons that if there were a family that had a child whom they knew was prophesied to kill Hitler, they'd have done the same.

I don't know the real answer though, you know? It's a difficult position that everyone's placed into. If we were in the same position, would we have acted the same way? I can't say, because I've never been in such a position before.
