  They impose their religious beliefs on the children. They force the children to participate in activities that the children want nothing to do with. They try to influence their children to go into the same profession. Any parent is going to be manipulative at best, and downright controlling at worst.

This is all true, but Harry wasn't facing the decision of Proddy or Papist, Auror or Quidditch which are far less consequential than an imminent fight against a dangerous lunatic. He only had all of the pieces as to why and how Albus had done what he had done when Voldemort was laying siege to Hogwarts and his friends (particularly Ron and Hermione) were in grave danger. Given what we came to know about Harry's values system, he certainly didn't feel like had any other choice but to play his part.

Albus' actions in canon don't morally balance for me, but I also think that the vast majority of manipulative!Dumbledore stories go way too far in their interpretation of his character. I'm always happy to read other opinions, though.
