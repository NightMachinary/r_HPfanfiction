The most evil thing he did was send Harry off to be abused by his family. It depends on whether or not he would have been truly endangered if he was given to another family/wizard/witch on whether this was evil. The "big head" he would develop from being raised in the world was a bit BS though, since it would be better to have an arrogant Harry rather than the a abused one.

That said, this was lessened in impact considering the berating Dumbledore gave the Dursleys in the sixth book. I think the fanon explanation of "Dumbledore had a lot on his plate, and ended up doing less good for Harry" is the most reasonable one. Harry was just another issue Dumbledore had to handle.

There simply isn't enough in the canon for "Evil Dumbledore" argument to be canon. If that's your fanfic, that's fine, but one can't really argue that he was evil in the actual story.
