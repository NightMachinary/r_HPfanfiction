Dumbledore is manipulative and rather ruthless when it comes to the fight against dark forces. His life was full of this fight, from early on.

The main difference between canon and fanon is that fanon Dumbledore is an idiot, while canon Dumbledore is not. The second is that canon Dumbledore is benevolent, caring and has a conscience.
