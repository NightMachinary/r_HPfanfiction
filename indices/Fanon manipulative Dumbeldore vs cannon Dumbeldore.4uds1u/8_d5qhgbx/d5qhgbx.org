This post was made for me.

I don't know what is the cause, if it's the films or fan fiction, or just the subtley of the way his character is written, but I do think that his character is one of the most universally misunderstood characters in the entire series.

I defend Dumbledore a lot, but I don't think he is perfect, I just think his faults are slightly different from what others imagine. I think the HP books are incredibly symbolic and that the major plot points and the major characters are directly or tangentially related to the themes of love, death, and choice. In contrast, I would say Game of Thrones is not symbolic (or at least not in the same way, the story isn't done yet, so I can't say for sure).

I do not think Dumbledore had a plan from the beginning - if we look at what he could have known, there's so little, there's just no way he /could/ have had a plan from the beginning. I think he's still soaking up all the information and going "what the hell is going on?".

Then, over time, he learns who Harry is, discovers with his own eyes that Harry repeatedly thwarts Voldemort, and best of all, Dumbledore (unlike Harry, unlike Voldemort, and unlike everyone else) undertands /why/, he /sees/ what power Harry has and how it's working against Voldemort. It's through seeing this proof that he decides Harry is the best candidate. I /don't/ think Dumbledore molds Harry to be the perfect soldier, I think Harry /is/ the perfect soldier and Dumbledore recognizes this and invites Harry to be a part of his plan.

But I don't think recognizing it comes easy to Dumbledore. I don't think he /wants/ Harry involved, despite knowing it's got to be him - and there's where Dumbledore's emotional weakness comes into play, the core of his characterization.

He's incredibly intelligent, and he knows that Harry has to die, but he's also incredibly empathatic and doesn't want him to have to die. What the hell is a person in that position going to do?

That characterization is entirely lost with Cruel!Dumbledore, who's selfish and only works for his own ends - but what the hell ARE those ends??
