There's no good explanation for all the plot-driven stuff he does and doesn't. Dumbledore could be a fascinating character, driven by guilt and hope and ideals tarnished by his past, struggling not to go too far each day.

But in canon, he was far too often reduced to an idiot so kids could be in danger and be heroes. Dumbledore as he was described wouldn't have let half or more of the shit in the books happen.
