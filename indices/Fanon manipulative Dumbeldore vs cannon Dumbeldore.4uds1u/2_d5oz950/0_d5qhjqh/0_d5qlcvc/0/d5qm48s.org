  There's no good explanation for all the plot-driven stuff he does and doesn't

Can you explain more why you think this?

  Dumbledore as he was described wouldn't have let half or more of the shit in the books happen.

I do agree to an extent - there's a lot of examples of this in the first two (not just with Dumbledore, but Voldemort and a couple others too), maybe some in the third, and I think even Goblet of Fire can kind of be thrown into this, but by OotP, I think his characterization is extremely thought out and his reasons for doing things are no longer just for plot-purposes - his characterization makes perfect sense for his actions and mistakes all have reasons that help explain what is going on in Harry's life and in their pursuit of ending Voldemort.

Everything he does in Goblet of Fire - Deathly Hallows and everything related to Grindelwald makes sense to me. I'm not really sure what you're saying.
