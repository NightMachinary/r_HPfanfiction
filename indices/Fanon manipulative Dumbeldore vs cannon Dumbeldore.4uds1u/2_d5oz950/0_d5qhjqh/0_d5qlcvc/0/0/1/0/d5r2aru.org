No, his mistakes make him not just human, but a failure, and a stupid failure to boot. I wouldn't object to calling canon Dumbledore an idiot - but that's not what he is presented at. He is, throughout the books, presented as a man just about every good character trusts and follows. If he is an idiot and makes so many mistakes as seen in the books, then what makes that those who follow him? Who's the greater fool, the fool or the one who follows him?

Though since the Order went along with the flight of the 7 Potters, a plan a 6 year old would have objected to on the grounds of being suicidally stupid, I guess we can't really call the Order competent or smart either. It's not as if Harry had /the/ Cloak of Invisibility, and could have walked out by himself and taken the bus 2 miles away or so... and it's not as if Harry and his friends had used that cloak in every book to sneak around.

That's why I say that the characters were wrecked and reduced to plot devices in the last few books.
