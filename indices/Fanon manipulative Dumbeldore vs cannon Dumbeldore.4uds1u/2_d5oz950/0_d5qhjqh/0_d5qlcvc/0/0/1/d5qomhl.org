But how do you /really/ feel? Haha!

Firstly - I think people think I'm defending every action Dumbledore took. He made /a lot/ of mistakes, in fact his characterization is centered around how much of a fuck-up he is. And how poetic, the wise Merlin-type is actually pretty cowardly and weak-minded. I attribute his mistakes to this rather than omniscience and maliciousness.

#+begin_quote
  He wastes his last year alive "teaching" Harry stuff about Voldemort that could have been done in an afternoon.
#+end_quote

I don't consider this a waste of time, but fair enough if you do.

#+begin_quote
  He doesn't take action against Draco, despite Ron and Katie and Slughorn almost dying - no benevolent Dumbledore would risk innocents and allies for a scumbag like Draco.
#+end_quote

I don't think Dumbledore thinks of Draco as a scumbag, but I also don't think he'd risk innocents for a less scummy Draco either. I think he /and/ Snape underestimated him to their discredit, just like Voldemort underestimated Harry at first. It's a mistake, for sure, but just slightly different than the one you're suggesting.

#+begin_quote
  That he wasn't able to give the key items the trio needed a few weeks before his death, instead of trying to smuglge them through the Ministry's checks? Stupid and pointless.
#+end_quote

Did they /need/ any of the items besides the sword, which Snape is in control of, and maybe Hermione's book? Honest question. How crucial are they?

#+begin_quote
  That he didn't set up the trio for their seach with all the goods and golds they needed? Safe houses included?
#+end_quote

What is the Order for then? It was Harry's (not Dumbledore's) decision to act alone. Dumbledore only said to not tell anybody about the Horcruxes, not to work alone.

#+begin_quote
  He should have trained the three a year long, not done "Tom Riddle, the movie".
#+end_quote

I disagree, but still consider this valid. I don't think any amount of training would be a match against Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  why didn't he ensure that the captured Death Eaters were killed after he was back in power?
#+end_quote

I'm sure Stan Shunpike would be very comforted to hear this.

The main take-away I get is that most people blame Dumbledore for EVERYTHING. We don't consider there are only so many hours in a day, only so many contigency plans you can devise, only so much influence you have over the government and other people. He /did/ do things wrong, and I enjoy discussing those because I think his mistakes are what make him the most fascinating character, but when we blame him for everything, we are expecting a robot or a god, and I think his mistakes make him the most /human/.
