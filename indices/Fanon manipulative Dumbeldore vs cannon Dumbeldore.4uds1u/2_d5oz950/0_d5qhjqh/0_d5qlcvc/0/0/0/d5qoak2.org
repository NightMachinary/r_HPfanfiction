  That he wasn't able to give the key items the trio needed a few weeks before his death, instead of trying to smuggle them through the Ministry's checks? Stupid and pointless. That he didn't set up the trio for their seach with all the goods and golds they needed? Safe houses included?

Exactly my gripe, he had ZERO contingency plan for his eventual death, and the Order didn't do any either after his death.

If Voldemort just practiced coup-d'etat 101 after the Ministry takeover, which was to liquidate your political enemies ASAP, the Weasleys would have been wiped out, and the Trio would have been emotionally destroyed.
