Alright: Take HBP. He wastes his last year alive "teaching" Harry stuff about Voldemort that could have been done in an afternoon. He doesn't take action against Draco, despite Ron and Katie and Slughorn almost dying - no benevolent Dumbledore would risk innocents and allies for a scumbag like Draco. You try to redeem that little shit after you make sure everyone is safe from his murder attempts. Draco should have been filled with Veritaserum and interrogated. That everyone else was losing all their minds and not suspecting Draco after five years of him proving what kind of scum he is is just the icing on the cake.

That he wasn't able to give the key items the trio needed a few weeks before his death, instead of trying to smuggle them through the Ministry's checks? Stupid and pointless. That he didn't set up the trio for their seach with all the goods and golds they needed? Safe houses included? Again, idiot ball, glued to his hand. He should have trained the three a year long, not done "Tom Riddle, the movie". Dumbledore had no sense of priorities.

Book 5: Even if we make up a reason why Dumbledore couldn't simply tell Fudge to shut up, or learn why he was the only one Voldemort feared, and couldn't arrange an accident for Umbridge and anyone else Fudge sent until the idiot understood the message that torturing kids was not allowed, why didn't he ensure that the captured Death Eaters were killed after he was back in power? Either he didn't expect Voldemort to take over after he died, in which case he would have been stupid, or he didnt care at all about all the innocents those scumbags would kill after broken out of prison again. If he doesn't want to kill them, he could obliviate them down to 11 year olds. But protecting the innocent has to be his priority, far, far before he thinks about protecting the scum.
