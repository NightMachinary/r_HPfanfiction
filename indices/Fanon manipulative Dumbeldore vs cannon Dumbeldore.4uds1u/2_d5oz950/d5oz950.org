Canon Dumbledore is not really a character a lot of the time, but a plot device. He's supposed to be wise, experienced and powerful as well as benevolent, yet he cannot show this, or act like it because the plot demands that he is useless whenever it counts so Hary can be an abused orphan and child hero, saving the day each book. You get fanon Dumbledore when you take his actions at face-value and try to explain why he'd act like that, instead of ignoring it.
