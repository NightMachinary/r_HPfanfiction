Well said. It's really easy for us to say he should have put Harry somewhere else, but then maybe Bellatrix (who was still at learge) would have cut through those defenses and killed Harry, and Dumbledore has a LOT on his plate, that he can't sit by a baby 24/7. Or maybe Voldemort would come back within weeks - Dumbledore just /didn't know/, so he chose the option that seemed like the best at the time.

(and for some reason we also assume Dumbledore knew /exactly/ what type of parents the Dursleys would be ten years later)
