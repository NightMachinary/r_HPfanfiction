I definitely agree that Dumbledore cared about Harry.

With that thought in mind, Dumbledore's decision to leave Harry with Vernon and Petunia came either from ruthlessness or abject stupidity. I'm more inclined to believe the former as Rowling went out of her way to have the entire series praise Dumbledore's intellect.
