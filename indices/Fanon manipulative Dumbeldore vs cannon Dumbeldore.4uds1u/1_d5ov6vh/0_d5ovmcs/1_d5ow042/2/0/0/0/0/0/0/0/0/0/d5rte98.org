Why would Dumbledore have to observe and investigate Harry thoroughly? Because whatever was done to Harry has resisted the Killing Curse and defeated the Dark Lord. Why wouldn't Dumbledore try to find out how that was done? He knows there is a protection on Harry. He even managed to move it to Privett Drive. Why wouldn't he try to duplicate it? Or find out how it was created, so it can be used against Voldemort? Find a way to defeat the Dark Lord without Harry having to die, maybe? Ignoring this "superweapon" makes no sense. At all.

And as long as Voldemort believes in the prophecy, Harry is important since Voldemort will come after him.

Harry is also a symbol for the resistance to Voldemort. Dumbledore could use his reputation and Harry's to deal with Malfoy gaining influence on Fudge.

Ignoring Harry was dumb and careless, even from a "I don't care about the boy, only about defeating Voldemort" point of view.

And even if we discount all that: If Dumbledore feels guilt and wants Harry to have a normal childhood, then making sure that he actually enjoys his childhood is the most basic, most obvious thing to do. And even if he failed utterly at that, he should have taken notice after Harry didn't receive his letters.

That's just too much stupidity for a charater like Dumbledore.
