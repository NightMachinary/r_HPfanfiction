If he knew how it was done, then /why didn't he teach others how to do it/? If he could duplicate it, why didn't he use it against Voldemort? Why wasn't the Burrow protected by it? Or Hogwarts? Did Dumbledore really care so little about children that he made no effort to seal up Hogwarts against Voldemort?

If it needed a sacrifice, well... he knew for a year in 1996 and 1997 that he was dying anyway.

If he couldn't do it himself... well, then he didn't understand it enough, right?

Dumbledore had 15 years to find a way to use Lily's discovery against the Death Eaters and Voldemort. He did nothing. He wasn't even able to prolong the effect past Harry's 17th birthday. And yet, once Harry sacrified himself, the protection was extended to everyone else on his side.

So, why didn't the greatest wizard of Britain work his butt off to use this knowledge you claim he already had? How many people could have been saved if the Order had known about this?
