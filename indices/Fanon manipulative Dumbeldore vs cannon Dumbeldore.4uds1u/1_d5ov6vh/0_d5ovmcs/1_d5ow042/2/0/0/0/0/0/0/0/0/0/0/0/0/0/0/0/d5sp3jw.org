I don't know what is so hard to understand:

If Dumbledore had been able to duplicate the effect, he would at the very least have used his own sacrifice to protect the Order. He didn't, hence he wasn't able to duplicate it. Hence he didn't study it enough.

What's so damn difficult to understand? The protection was never duplicated in the books. It was always just Harry's protection, manipulated a bit at most.

Ergo: Dumbledore couldn't duplicate it, or he'd have done it.

And duplicating that protection is not that difficult to think of. And if Dumbeldore had at least tried to study it, he'd have observed Harry more, and the abuse wouldn't have happened.
