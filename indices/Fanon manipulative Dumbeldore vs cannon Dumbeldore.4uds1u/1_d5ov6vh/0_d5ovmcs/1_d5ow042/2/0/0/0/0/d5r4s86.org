If Harry /were/ the only hope against Voldemort, then I would agree, but Dumbledore doesn't believes in pre-destiny as he tells Harry in HBP - he says Harry doesn't /have/ to go after Voldemort because of the prophecy, that not all the prophecies in the Department of Mysteries came true. He tell Harry that he has to go after Voldemort because Harry /wants/ to go after Voldemort (which I'm sure you cannot deny that Harry's been wanting that since he was eleven). Dumbledore only thinks Harry is the best option after Harry has proven in several ways that he /is/ the best option. Before Harry has proven himself, Dumbledore would have no reason to think Harry needs to be involved - besides needing to be destroyed of course - hence the emotional distancing and neglect.
