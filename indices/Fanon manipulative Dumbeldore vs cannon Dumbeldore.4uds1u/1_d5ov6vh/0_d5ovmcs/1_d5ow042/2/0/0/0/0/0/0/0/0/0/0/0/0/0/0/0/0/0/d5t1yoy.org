My thoughts: If Lily can do it, someone else can do it as well. The exact conditions (standing stupidly in teh way, begigng, etc.) do not need to be duplicated, but the intent counts. So, anyone sacrificing themselves should be able to duplicate this protection, at least in some way, given the intent to protect people at the cost of their own life.

I do not think that Harry and Lily were the only ones ever willing to die for their loved ones. I find that idea stupid, even. Especially if Harry stumbles upon it.

And once again: I consider the fact no one else did it, no one was taught the method, evidence enough that Dumbledore didn't study the effect enough and didn't teach anyone else.
