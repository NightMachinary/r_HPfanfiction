  Why would Dumbledore have to observe and investigate Harry thoroughly? Because whatever was done to Harry has resisted the Killing Curse and defeated the Dark Lord. Why wouldn't Dumbledore try to find out how that was done?

You answer your own question - he knew how it was done - he even added onto the protections which is why Harry lived with Petunia. He did duplicate that very magic too with Harry's self-sacrifice eradicating Voldemort's power and he did figure out a way to allow Harry to survive too. I'm so confused what you're saying, everything you're blaming Dumbledore for not doing, he did. You just seem to be expecting him to have done it without the information he needed to plan it properly. It's the beginning of Hitchhiker's Guide when the Vogans wonder why Earth didn't realize their planet was going to be destroyed since the documents were accessable for three years in another galaxy.
