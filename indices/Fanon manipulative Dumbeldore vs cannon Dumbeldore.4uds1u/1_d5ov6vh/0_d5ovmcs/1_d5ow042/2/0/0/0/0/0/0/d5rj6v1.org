Serious question because I genuinely don't get this sometimes, and I know people have different opinions and I may be getting yours mixed up with others I've heard, so correct me if I'm wrong.

But it seems to me you were at first condemning Dumbledore for making Harry involved in all this, and now saying it was the only logical option?

Why would Dumbledore plan for a child to do anything? What does he know at that point that makes that option logical? It all seemed /illogical/ to me to look at an infant and go "I know exactly what he's gonna do", when at that point in time there are better options. What within canon tells us he's confident baby Harry will become the sort of person capable of defeating a Dark Lord? Why not have it be someone much older and more capable?
