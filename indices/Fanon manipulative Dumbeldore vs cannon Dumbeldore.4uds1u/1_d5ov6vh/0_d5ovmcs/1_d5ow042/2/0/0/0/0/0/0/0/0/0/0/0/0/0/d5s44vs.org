We disagree fundamentically about what could be done with this knowledge then. I simply do not think that this was so unique, yet so easily adaptable for all sorts of effects (burning Quirrell, protecting the home, providing protection to everyone) that Dumbledore couldn't have used it. And I certainly do not think that the effect was not possible to be duplicated.

Basically, I consider the "Dumbledore couldn't have done better" view unacceptable, especially since in the end, it all came down to convoluted coincidences and sheer luck. Dumbeldore's plans made were worthless since if not for some weird wand allegiance trick and some basic mistakes by Voldemort, all would have failed.
