I'm not saying he should have planned for Harry to defeat the Dark Lord at X age - but he should have observed Harry much, much ore closely in his childhood. The importance Harry had both due to the prophecy - which the Dark Lord believed - and due to the fact that he survived the Killing Curse and defeated the Dark Lord - makes neglecting, ignoring even, Harry stupid. I'm condemning canon Dumbledore for failing to treat and later train Harry properly.
