  If he knew how it was done, then why didn't he teach others how to do it? If he could duplicate it, why didn't he use it against Voldemort?
#+end_quote

You are expecting too much about of magic. He knew how it was done, but it's not something that can be easily duplicated. What would you say intention affects magic? Voldemort had to intend to spare Lily, Lily had to intend to die, and then Voldemort had to change his mind and intend to kill her for the magic to work.

Do you think it is easy to set up a scenario in which intention can work so suitably in your favor? Once Voldemort took Harry's blood and insisted nobody else kill Harry so that he, himself, could do it, then Dumbledore recognized an opportunity to re-create the magic, but you can't just whip it up out of thin air, that's not how this magic works.

  If it needed a sacrifice, well... he knew for a year in 1996 and 1997 that he was dying anyway.
#+end_quote

I'm sure he would have been happy to give up his life for that sort of magical protection, but then Harry still stuck being a Harrycrux meaning Voldemort still can't die. Having Harry sacrifice serves two purposes, not just one. It negates Voldemort's power and also removes the bit of soul while allowing Harry to live. The soul could have been destroyed any other way, but this is the only way in which Harry can return to life.

  If he couldn't do it himself... well, then he didn't understand it enough, right?
#+end_quote

Why do you think magic works this way?

#+begin_quote
  He did nothing. He wasn't even able to prolong the effect past Harry's 17th birthday. And yet, once Harry sacrified himself, the protection was extended to everyone else on his side.
#+end_quote

You are mixing up two different types of protection. Lily's protection means Voldemort can't kill Harry and lasts forever (or until Voldemort uses Harry's blood), Dumbledore's added protections prevent Voldemort from /finding/ Harry while he's at the Dursleys, and this one expires when Harry is 17. They are two separate protections that serve different purposes and have differnet life-spans. The kind that Harry is able to replicate is the former, that prevents Voldemort from killing, it does not prevent Voldemort from finding.

  So, why didn't the greatest wizard of Britain work his butt off to use this knowledge you claim he already had?
#+end_quote

He did. I think you are expecting too much from magic, that because they need a way to defeat Voldemort, that there is a magical option to do it just /because/, that magic can solve any problem, regardless of what the problem is. But magic isn't a blank canvas, there are limitations. Dumbledore /does/ find a way to defeat Voldemort /and/ it works. But there are things that had to happen before it became a viable option that would work. Before CoS, it wouldn't have worked because Dumbledore didn't know about multiple Horcruxes, so sacrifying his life would have been fruitless and Dumbledore was clever enough to know he didn't know enough to act yet. I think Dumbledore would have been fine to do it after Goblet of Fire, but that still doesn't solve the problem of the Harrycrux and giving Harry a long life. But then we have to ask - is Harry's life more important than the lives that could have been saved if Dumbledore had sacrificed his life sooner? I think Dumbledore would have made the hard choice to prioritize the lives of many over the life of one /if he had to/, but I think outside cirucmstances (i.e. his impending death) meant that he was never faced with that question - he spent Harry's sixth year hunting Horcruxes and found one - but he'll die before he can hunt them all and he knows it, so he gives the job to someone else - and he gave it to Harry for the reasons I mentioned before. Are you saying that limitations like time don't apply to Dumbledore? That each books starts with Dumbledore having a fully-formed plan? That once the book starts his plans are fully-formed just because you think they ought to be? That spending the one year between Voldemort's return and the beginning of HBP is far too long to come up with a plan so Dumbledore clearly was sitting on his ass eating lemon drops?

Everything you are saying he didn't do he /did/ actually do! I'm so confused!

#+begin_quote
  How many people could have been saved if the Order had known about this?
#+end_quote

Maybe some, but maybe others would have died. If Voldemort understood what would happen if he asked Harry to come to his own death, he would never have done given Harry that option, and yet it being an option was essential. Dumbledore's plan is completely dependent on Voldemort's ignorance of how important that part is. Perhaps it was a wrong move to keep it a secret, and that's for you to decide, but at least consider how dangerous it would be to tell the Order only to discover once again there was a spy who would tell Voldemort these plans.
