  If Lily can do it, someone else can do it as well.

Yes, I totally agree, but it's not Lily's intent alone that matters. James died with exactly the same intent but his death created no magical protection. It was Voldemort's intent to spare her and then him changing his mind as well as Lily's together that created the magical protection for Harry.

  So, anyone sacrificing themselves should be able to duplicate this protection

No, for the reason above - not just any single person can recreate the magic - it is dependent on the intentions of both the attacker and the killer. The German-speaking woman who Voldemort killed while looking for Gregorovitch did what Lily did, as have countless of other mothers, fathers, friends, etc. But their sacrifices and attempts to save their loved ones did not create magical protection, because Voldemort had not entered into the Potter's house or the German-speaking woman's house with the original intention of sparing James or the woman.

When Harry sacrificed himself, Voldemort always intended on killing him, what made it a choice is that he gave Harry the option to come /to/ him - Harry could have ignored him, but he chose to go.

Furthermore - I do not think Lily's sacrifice is the first time this magic has formed, it seems clear to me it's happened in the past, or else how could Dumbledore have recognized it so quickly? It seems clear this is the sort of thing only well-read and educated witches and wizards would understand, like our Muggle genius mathematicians and stuff like that.
