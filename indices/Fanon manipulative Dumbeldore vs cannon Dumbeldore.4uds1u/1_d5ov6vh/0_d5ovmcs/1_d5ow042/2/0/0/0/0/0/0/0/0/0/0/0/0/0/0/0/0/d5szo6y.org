  Hence he didn't study it enough.

That's why - because there's plenty of evidence in the books that reveals he did and there was no way to succeed at it until things aligned at the end of GoF. It just seems to me you're making up how the magic works to fit your theory.

Harry's sacrifice in the forest is the duplication plan you're looking for.

There are clear-cut reasons he was able to succeed here in ways that he could not have duplicated until after Goblet of Fire. It would not have been successful because of the very /nature/ of magic - this magic is dependent on the wizard's intention.

I think that's at the core of why we disagree - I don't know your thoughts on how magic works in this world, but I'm guessing intention has nothing to do with it?
