No, you brought up that Voldemort had to be involved in the magic, that his change of opinion and intent was critical - which I do not think.

What canon rules about magic are you thinking I am violating? That intent matters? Lily's intent matters, no one else's. And if she can do it, anyone else can do it too.

That's canon magic: You can learn how to do it. You can find out how others did things, and do it yourself.

Why do you think that's not the case for Lily's magic? Why do you think what she did couldn't be done by others? By Dumbledore?
