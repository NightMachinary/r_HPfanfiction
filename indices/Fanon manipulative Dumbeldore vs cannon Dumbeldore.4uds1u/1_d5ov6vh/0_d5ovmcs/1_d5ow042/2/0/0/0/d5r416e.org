It's one thing to neglect a boy. It's another to neglect your best and only hope against Voldemort - a Dark Lord who, nota bene, Dumbledore thinks came from a loveless and bad childhood.

Neglecting Harry takes so much stupidity, it can't be explained by Dumbledore making "normal mistakes". It's another "If we take this seriously, then Dumbledore really is an idiot who will be outwitted by an 11 year old" plot device.
