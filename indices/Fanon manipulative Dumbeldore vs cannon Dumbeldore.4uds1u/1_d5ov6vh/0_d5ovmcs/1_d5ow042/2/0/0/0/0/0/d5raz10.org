Harry is the best hope to defeat Voldemort, no matter what he wants, because he is protected from Voldemort. Whatever Lily has done is so powerful, Dumbledore wouldn't ignore it. If it can be duplicated, or extended somehow, it would be crucial even if Harry curled up and whimpered whenever he heard Tom's name. It makes no sense that Dumbledore wouldn't pursue this, or at least observe how Harry is doing.
