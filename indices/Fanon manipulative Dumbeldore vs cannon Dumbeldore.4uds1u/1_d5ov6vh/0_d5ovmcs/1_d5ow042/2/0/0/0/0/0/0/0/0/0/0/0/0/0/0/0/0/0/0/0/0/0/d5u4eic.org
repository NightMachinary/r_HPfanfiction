Please - as if she'd expect him to spare her. There's a reason helpless pretty women usually were not killed outright in such situations, and it's not a pretty one. Lily had no reason at all to expect that she'd survive much longer. Not as a muggleborn, when he had already killed her pureblood husband.

(Not to mention that she had no reason at all to expect him to kill her when he wanted to spare her anyway - he could have stunned her, could used a body-bind curse, or an incarcarous. The worst Dark Lord of Britain, and he looses his temper so easily? When all he had to do was flick his wand and be done? Even a crucio would have put her out of action long enough to kill Harry. The entire sacrifice scene is utterly convoluted. For my stories, I usually asusme that it happened quite differently, with both Potters fighting to the last, selling their lives dearly, or Lily sacrificing herself in a ritual, not this shitty begging and Voldemort having a crowning moment of stupidity.)
