Lily's protection protected Harry from being killed by Voldemort no matter what way Voldemort attempted to kill Harry. When he tried the Killing curse, the curse backfried, when he tried to strangle Harry (while possessing Quirrell) it made it so strangling was too painful to keep doing. A lot of people joke that he should have thrown Harry out a window - but the magic would have prevented it.

When Harry dies for everyone it means whatever way Voldemort tries to kill them, he will be thwarted - which in this case was Voldemort's spells not sticking. Some worked at first, but then Ron and the other managed to break through them - but it's the same as Quirrell strangling Harry - he managed to start it, but couldn't finish killing him.

These two are the same, so I'm not sure why you're using them as if they are different applications/adaptations.

  And I certainly do not think that the effect was not possible to be duplicated.

/exactly which is why Dumbledore duplicated it, it is his entire charactization leads up to/. I'm still completely confused by what you're saying - it still seems to me you're saying you wished he did A, but he did do A, so... I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here, what are you saying?

  if not for some weird wand allegiance trick and some basic mistakes by Voldemort, all would have failed.

Yes!! But you're forgetting Harry's own wand's power against Voldemort. Dumbledore intended Harry to beat Voldemort because his pheonix feather wand had absorbed Voldemort's own power and considered Voldemort a mortal enemy. This is why the chapter where Voldemort dies is called the "Flaw In the Plan" because it wasn't part of the plan, but fate had worked in Harry's favor, reinforcing the themes of why Harry was able to win in the first place!

And lastly, to assume that Dumbledore can come up with a completely 100% perfect plan is asking a helluva lot. The man may be smart, but he's not God.
