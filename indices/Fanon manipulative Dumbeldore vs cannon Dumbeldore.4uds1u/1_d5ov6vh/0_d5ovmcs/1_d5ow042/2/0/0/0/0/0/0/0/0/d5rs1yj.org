  The importance Harry had both due to the prophecy - which the Dark Lord believed
#+end_quote

Voldemort believed, but Dumbledore's reaction is determined by what he believes too.

Let's say he believes the prophecy definitely comes true - but the prophecy still doesn't say who will win "either must die at the hands of the other", but Voldemort /can't/ kill Harry becomes of Lily's sacrifice, and Harry /can't/ kill Voldemort because Harry's got to die before Voldemort does and a dead person can't kill Voldemort. The prophecy predicts two scenarios that are /both/ currently impossible - sort of an anti-paradox. So... the prophecy must be referring to a scenario that hasn't revealed itself yet... therefore, I do not think a Dumbledore who believed the prophecy would come true would create a plan because what plan can he create yet when there's clearly an unknown predestined scenario that hasn't happened yet. I think this Dumbledore would spend his time examining Harry closely and doing a ton of research.

An opposite theory, what if Dumbledore doesn't believe the prophecy will come true at all, he acts only because he knows /Voldemort/ believes it and will try to kill Harry. Therefore Harry's only reason to be involved is because he is harboring a bit of Voldemort's soul and must be killed. In this scenario, I think Dumbledore would keep as far away from Harry as possible in order to not get too close to this child whose death he may someday have to plan. I say "someday", because Dumbledore still can't know what will happen - maybe Voldemort will never return and then therefore Dumbledore never has to kill Harry. In this scenario there is no reason to train Harry or, in fact, to do anything with him.

But I don't think either of the above are correct. Some prophecies come true - even Dumbledore can't deny despite his low opinion of Divination. But enough /don't/ come true that if Dumbledore can make the one about Voldemort/Harry /not/ come true, then I think he'd work towards that goal (edit: as in, Dumbledore himself would defeat Voldemort and Harry doesn't have to do anything, or to try to indefinitely delay Voldemort from being able to return so that he floats as a spectral ghost forever, or something else creative like that). Again - the prophecy says either must die at the hand of the other - at this point in time Voldemort is the /clear/ winner against an infant. Even 15-20 years from now, Voldemort is still going to be the superior wizard to any kid. Even a ruthless!Dumbledore who doesn't care about the life of a child would see that attempting to avoid the prophecy is the best way to defeat Voldemort, because /how/ can a child win? Especially considering the anti-paradox.

So I reckon a Dumbledore who's planning for both scenarios would still make sure he's not super close to Harry - he sets protections around Harry to avoid his murder, but keeps far away from him in case he has to someday plan the kid's death, and caring for the kid would make that much harder. He keeps a close watch on Voldemort and sees that he's not coming back until about shortly before Harry's first year, and I /think/ Dumbledore comes up with some plan for Harry that year, but I /don't/ think it panned out the way he wanted it to - I can get more into my toughts on this, but essentially, I think Harry didn't act the way Dumbledore expected him to, and Dumbledore realized what a stout-hearted, brave, and loving kid Harry was and his attempts to distance himself began to fall apart - /“Yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine.”/ (Book 5, U.S. p. 837).

I think from the end of Philosopher's Stone onward, Dumbledore becomes blinded and begins to inadvertenly work against what he knows will get rid of Voldemort, because getting rid of Voldemort means getting rid of Harry. He's tries to delay and delay his return, but Voldemort keeps pushing back - but working towards killing Voldmeort means working towards killing /Harry/, which is becoming more and more and /more/ horrible to think about - so Dumbledore doesn't. /"What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you were alive, and well, and happy? I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hands"/. He's emotionally weak and he deep down he knows he has to think about it, but isn't it just so much easier to push it away. Voldemort isn't back /yet/ anyway....

And then he /is/ back, but.... but... Harry says he used Harry's blood...... Harry no longer has to die! /Harry no longer has to die!/

I think it takes him a year before he gets used to the idea (hence the mess he causes in OotP), but this (and the fact that Harry's wand absorbed Voldemort's power, that his wand is imbibed with Harry's immense courage making it extremely powerful against Voldemort, the fact Harry doesn't need Occlumency, the fact Harry can read Voldy's mind, and the fact that Harry is guided by love and clearly has greater fears than death) is why Dumbledore finally accepts that Harry's got to be involved.

So basically - why do you think Dumbledore needs to pay attantion to Harry if you agree he doesn't believe prophecies have to come true? I'm asking less about the morality of it (because I think Dumbledore should have simply out of human decency) and more about the strategy and research related to defeating Voldemort.
