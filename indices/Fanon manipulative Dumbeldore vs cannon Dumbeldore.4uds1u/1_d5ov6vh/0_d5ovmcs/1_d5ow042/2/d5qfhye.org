I think it came out of neglect - not in the way a parent neglects their child, but still neglect in the way where Dumbledore didn't want to get too close to this child and convinced himself (for good reasons as well as bad) that at the Dursleys was the best place for him (I don't think any place was the best place for him, to be honest).

  I'm more inclined to believe the former as Rowling went out of her way to have the entire series praise Dumbledore's intellect.

Be careful not to confuse intellect with emotional strength. Dumbledore's brilliant, he's powerful, he's committed to making the world a better place...

... but he is a god damned fool when it comes to love. It doesn't make him stronger like it does with Harry, it clouds his judgements. This is what he learned with Grindelwald, and so he tries to not care about Harry, but he fails that too, which leads to a lot of mistakes, like thinking he can give Harry a normal childhood by keeping secrets from him. But he's wrong. Harry can't have a normal childhood, and Dumbledore finally accepts that at the end of OotP.
