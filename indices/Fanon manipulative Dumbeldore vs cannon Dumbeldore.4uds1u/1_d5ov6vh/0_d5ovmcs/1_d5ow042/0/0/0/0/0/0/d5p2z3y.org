Seriously you could have just stuck a time-delayed portkey on his body, put a strong notice-me-not charm on it and make sure it activates when he's alone at home. Either do it stealthily or just obliviate him afterwards.

Make it a one-way portkey and for god's sake just kill him when you're done with the ritual.

You have nothing to gain by beating a 14 year old in a "duel" even if he miraculously survived an AK when he was a baby.
