That plan to get his body back had so many holes it's not even funny. The most obvious failure is that Harry was almost eaten by a dragon months before the plan got into its late stages.

That plan could have failed at each task and it's just luck and author fiat that kept Barty from being discovered and dosed with veritaserum. The fact that there were four triwizard participants should have had everyone (especially the brilliant Professor Dumbledore who is old friends with the very paranoid ex-auror Alastor Moody) suspicious of the circumstances and had them investigate every visitor that had access to the cup (especially Karkaroff and the defense professor) to understand what happened.

One of the few "reasonable" explanations of what Happened is that Dumbledore is an evul manipulator who secretly wanted Voldemort back for reasons.
