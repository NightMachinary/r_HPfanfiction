That's the most compelling argument I've heard for in defense of Dumbledore's character regarding Harry's early childhood. I'd never considered Dumbledore's age and how his own childhood would have taken place in first half of the 1800s which was a very different social environment.

I'm still not convinced that it redeems him, but it certainly paints him in a less harsh light for me.

With regards to Voldemort, Harry unhinges him because his normal methods of operation are completely ineffective. We don't see him being competent behind the scenes (anything pre-books, orchestrating the events of GoF, taking over the Ministry). I'm willing to give Rowling the benefit of the doubt on that, particularly considering making an seventh horcrux (beyond seven pieces) might have had disproportionate and unexpected effects on Voldemort's stability.
