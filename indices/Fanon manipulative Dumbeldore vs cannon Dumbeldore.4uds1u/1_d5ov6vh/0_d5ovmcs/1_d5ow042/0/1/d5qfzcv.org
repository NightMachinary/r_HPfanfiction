  But she also went out of her way to praise Voldemort's intellect too so I don't think we can really trust her narration.

Intelligence does not mean you make the right emotional choices, though. Voldemort and Dumbledore /are/ both incredibly intelligent. This and power are what Voldemort values and are what Dumbledore valued when he met Grindelwald. But his experience with Grindelwald made him realize that intelligence and power are not good without the stability empathy and love bring to it.

I think to an extent Dumbledore is quote unquote "fine" with the Dursleys being bad parents, but I don't think he would have approved of just /how/ bad it was - hence why things begin to improve once Harry rejoins the Wizarding World and it becomes clear how awful they are.
