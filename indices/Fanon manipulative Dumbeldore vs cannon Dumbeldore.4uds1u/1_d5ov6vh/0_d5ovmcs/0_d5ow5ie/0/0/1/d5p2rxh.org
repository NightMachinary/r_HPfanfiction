I agree that the fics that conveniently have a Goblin Ritual just for the unique occasion of a human, living horcrux are ridiculous but i just can't believe that there's no other way to remove it and even if there isn't it shouldn't be impossible to destroy all the other Horcruxes, kill Voldemort's current body and then somehow detain the specter until Harry dies of natural causes.

I think the main problem is that Rowling did not think her magic system. It's a terribly confusing mess that doesn't make any sense and therefore fanfic authors can do whatever the fuck they want with it because it can't possible get any worse anyway.
