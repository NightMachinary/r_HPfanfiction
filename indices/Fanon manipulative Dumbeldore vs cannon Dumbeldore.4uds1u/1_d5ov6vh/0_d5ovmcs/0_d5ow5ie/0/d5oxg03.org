It's kind of a fucked up situation, would it really be better to just go with full disclosure and guilt Harry into killing himself?, because that would have worked too.

I think that the obvious solution is working on re-killing Voldemort and getting some breathing space to figure out Horcruxes and how to destroy them without destroying the object they are attached to.
