The biggest damning of canon Dumbledore in my opinion is Snape's memories at the end of Book 7 where Snape (of all people) accuses Dumbledore of raising Harry like a pig for slaughter. Stacked on top of all the other evidence that Dumbledore cares for ends far more than means, I think manipulative and ruthless is a completely fair characterization of canon Albus.

That said, he wasn't malevolent. Just a little too willing to sacrifice others to the greater good.

EDIT: Regarding fanon!Dumbledore: My biggest complaint is that writers have DD becoming unhinged far too often. I don't care so much that DD fails (although failing repeatedly to children with "wing it" as their gameplan is far too common), but that he doubles down every single time and winds up being completely unbelievable as a character, both in dialogue and action.
