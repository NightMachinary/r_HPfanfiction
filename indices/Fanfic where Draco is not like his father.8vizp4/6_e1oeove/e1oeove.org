So, I guess there's a number of dramiones that would fit the bill...kinda, if you don't mind romance as a large aspect. I'm uncertain if you're looking for lengthy fics or not, but here are two where his character is quite different.

1) A short one-shot where Draco is a fan of the Cannons and that causes him to befriend the trio on the train. Linkffn(12503529)

2) A longer story, AU, where he's given Hermione as a muggle 'pet' but grows fond of her, eventually leading to a stand-off against Lucius. Linkffn(9741840)
