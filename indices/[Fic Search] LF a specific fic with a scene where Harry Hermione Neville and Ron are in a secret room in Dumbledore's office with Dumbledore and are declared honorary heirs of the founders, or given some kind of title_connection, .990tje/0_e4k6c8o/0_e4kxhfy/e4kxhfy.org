I say I'm fairly certain that it's not Dangerverse because I binged the whole series not that long ago and don't recall this scene in it. I know all the tokens and stuff given to the kids in Dangerverse, and this didn't feel like that. For one, I recall it to be the first time the kids are "introduced" to the concept of the whole honorary founders heir thing, and I remember them being much older than when the kids in Dangerverse met the founders the first time.

The few things I can distinctly remember are that the trio plus Neville and Dumbledore are there, /maybe/ Ginny too, and that there's a whole scene where Dumbledore takes them through his office into a secret basement.

The website was ffn.

I'm sorry I can't give much more information than that, it was a long time ago that I read it. I think it might be one of those scenes that if you read the fic, you'd know heat I'm taking about, but it's too vague to be properly Google searched, since I can't remember any phrases.

There's some small part of me thinking that it might be the Refiner's Fire series, or the Dumbledore's Army by Bobmin series, since both of those have a more actively helpful Dumbledore than the majority of fanfic, but that could just be wishful thinking.
