Do you remember what the gifts were? That could help with a search if they were unusual. Are there any phrases you might remember?

If you recall "Thank you, Hufflepuff.", or the gifts in question were coloured beads that they could use for wishes of some sort, then it's Dangerverse, but otherwise, I dunno.

...Oh, and which site? Archive of our Own? Fanfiction.net?
