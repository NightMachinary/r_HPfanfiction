Aussies love messing with foreigners about shit. Once told a guy that drop bears were genetically engineered koalas with glider wings and vampire teeth that fall from trees and suck peoples blood. Told him that vegemite wards them off, and since we eat them from childhood we secrete a scent that keeps them away.

The guy ended up coming out of his tent wearing a massive sombrero and covered in vegemite.
