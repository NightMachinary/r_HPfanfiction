The film actually lets us hear Sirius and Snape going at it in the dining room (though you have to listen carefully during the Extendable Ear scene). But the book simply has Sirius say this to Harry later on:

  ‘Oh yeah,' said Sirius sarcastically. ‘Listening to Snape's reports, having to take all his snide hints that he's out there risking his life while I'm sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time ... asking me how the cleaning's going --'

/Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix/, chapter five.

Either way, neither Sirius nor Snape tried to be friendly towards each other in OotP.
