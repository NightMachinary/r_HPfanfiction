Laughing doesn't imply amusement. They could've been laughing for any number of reasons, relief being amongst them. Or to diffuse a serious situation. That's your takeaway from the situation based on your opinion of James and the other three.

Saying the biggest bullies on a playground doesn't mean they were literally supporting the genocide of an entire subgroup of Wizards and Witches.

How about Snape finding it funny what happened to Mary McDonald and hanging out with creeps like Mulciber and Avery, later Death Eaters? Being bullies in school isn't comparable /whatsoever/ to being in a literal death squad. It isn't fanon to say that, it's a fact. He made Snape gag on soap which is relatively mild to the curses that Snape threw around. We know he gave as good as he got and he started that grudge on the train by making a completely unnecessary gesture at them for wanting to be in Gryffindor
