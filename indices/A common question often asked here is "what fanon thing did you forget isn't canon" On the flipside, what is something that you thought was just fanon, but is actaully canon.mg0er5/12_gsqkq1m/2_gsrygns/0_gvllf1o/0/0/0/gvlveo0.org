Sirius says the marauders were the biggest bullies on the playground. Not the death eaters ðŸ˜‚ I'm sure there are fics with that premise. Probably most marauder centric fics

I do think some of it may have become ideology based in 7th year, but none of them ever actually point out this as a reason even when defending their actions and trying to portray them in the most positive light possible. James also had a lot of recourse, being headboy, to handling it officially. The fact that he went behind Lily's back to do it implies that it wasn't exactly something he thought she'd approve of. If he was basically a death eater, it would be very justified, especially if it was in retaliation.

But James being headboy, having all these tools (map, cloak, animagi friends), and him not hexing Snape infront of Lily implies a lot of agency on his part. It would be retaliatory on Snapes part. So yep, justified or not, still bullying, little change
