Laughing in this instance means they made light of the situation and did it again and again. If it was just relief it would be a one off thing, not something they did regularly.

  Saying the biggest bullies on a playground doesn't mean they were literally supporting the genocide of an entire subgroup of Wizards and Witches.

No one said they were. But it's clear that atleast in school they were the most cruel lot. Putting people in danger on the regular, relentlessly bullying favourite targets, hexing people just because they could, getting detentions but never improving their behaviour, and instead actually taking pride in this rule breaking. It is a testament to their cruelty that they were the biggest bullies at school, not future bloody death eaters.

  How about Snape finding it funny what happened to Mary McDonald

Except that it was supposed to be dark magic, we don't know what Mulciber /attempted/ to do that had Lily all riled up in that scene.

  and hanging out with creeps like Mulciber and Avery, later Death Eaters?

I've mentioned it's a very different discussion and gave you some rope with the arguments I made for why Snape joined them. Ultimately, however, we're talking about school time in this discussion, and Severus was not a death eater at this point, neither was the marauders' bullying about it. In fact, even the worst thing Sirius say about young Snape is that he was a slimy oily dark arts obsessed dude. Considering the very vague definition of dark arts themselves, that Severus seems to excels in almost all fields of magic, not just dark arts, its unclear if it's something we really should be mad at young Snape about. We also saw in dh how it started, and who exactly escalated. It's pretty clear marauders were a) bullies b)bullied Snape specifically and relentlessly c) this bullying had nothing to do with him being a death eater. Indeed, Sirius didn't even know that Snape was a death eater, even though he knew a lot of the people in Snape's group had become one.

Is it bad that he became a death eater later? Sure. Is the marauders' bullying justified for a young non de social outcast Snape? No. We're the marauders worst than the death eaters? No. We're the marauders more cruel than the death eater wannabes, atleast from the things we know about their schooltime activities? Yes.

  He made Snape gag on soap which is relatively mild to the curses that Snape threw around.
#+end_quote

Was it? /Choking/ someone in public because he's cussing you? What curses did Snape throw on the marauders, exactly? A small cutting curse that cut James' cheek after he'd hung him upside down in public, refused to let him down, blackmailed Lily, choked him, dropped him on his head unceremoniously? After literal torture? That's mild af. I'm very surprised that the marauders had all their body parts attached. That shows serious restraint on Snapes part, lmao. Young sev was making bloody toenail hexes and privacy spells before he felt powerless and desperate enough to make the very emphatically signed 'for enemies' sectumsempra.

Bruh, don't defend James on the torture bit. Literally impossible. You'll just end up doing a lot of whataboutism for which there is no evidence, only your speculation. And it very much takes away from your points of you thinking it's bullying, admitting you've been bullied yourself, and then coming out and defending such a heinous act of outright physical bullying which started out because a dude was /bored/. I mean, come on

  We know he gave as good as he got and he started that grudge on the train by making a completely unnecessary gesture at them for wanting to be in Gryffindor
#+end_quote

I'm glad he did and didn't just take it like a good boy

Ah, so according to you, Snape started it? I'd implore you to read the chapter again, notice how Snape was talking to Lily and James' butted in and waxed poetic about gryffindor and dissed Slytherin with not impetus from Snape whatsoever. How dare baby Snape /snort/ at James' antics lmfao. The nerve of him to contradict a rich boy who's been pampered all his life ðŸ˜‚

You'd also notice that James started the physical bullying by sticking his leg out and either him or Sirius christening him Snivellus because he turned away from the fight when Lily implored him. But first, it'll be enough for you to just notice who butted in first, lmfao ðŸ¤£
