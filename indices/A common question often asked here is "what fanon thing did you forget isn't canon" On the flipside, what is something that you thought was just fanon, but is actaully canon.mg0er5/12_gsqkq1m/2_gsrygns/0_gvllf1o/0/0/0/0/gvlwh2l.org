I'm sorry, I'll take goofy bullies over literal wizard Nazis who advocate for and support the extermination of an entire population of wizards and witches.

The Marauders were troublemakers and would jinx and hex people for fun, but that's much, much different than making friends with people who were literally in the circle of a Dark Wizard who was taking over the ministry, murdering muggleborns and light side families, and the suggested act they committed against another witch according to Lily herself. Snape was def bullied, and I'm sorry for him as someone who was bullied myself, but that doesn't excuse becoming a genocidal wizard who hangs out with other genocidal wizards.
