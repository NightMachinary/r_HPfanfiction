It'd be pretty alright if they were just 'goofy' bullies, lol. But we know their idea of what's humorous. Choking, sexual assault, removing underpants to a crowd, midnight runs which resulted in people almost getting killed via werewolf and laughing afterwards, bullying people because they could, or if they annoyed them.

I know where the ideas of them being goofy bullies comes from. Mostly pre-hbp when we didn't want to believe how bad these awesome adults and Harry's father were, and didn't have the knowledge. People thought swm was the worst of it. That ww incident happened after. But no. They initiated a... torture session really, of someone minding his own business because one of them was bored after said bored guy had already almost got that killed, after the initiator had supposedly saved his life for its own sake and not for his friends. He gives the 'just because he exists' reason to someone he wants to impress /after/ that person had almost died because of his friends and while he held his dear friend's secret.

Like bruh. That's not goofing around. That's literal criminal behaviour that they are directly involved in. And they get a pass because they were rich, popular jocks who went on to join the right side in the end? That negates none of this. 15 year old James would've joined the order, that doesn't make his literal torture okay.

You gotta rethink your life when what voldemort calls muggle torture is milder than what you did to a classmate because you were bored, lmao

Don't derail the bullying discussion w/ Snape becoming a death eater. That ignored the effect the bullying and blind eye by the general of the good side would have on his decisions. It's a completely other discussion. The point of this post was james bullied Snape, and continued doing it till later. That's not something to take sides over. Its bad. What Snape became later was bad. The difference, obviously, is that James exercised his power because he was a priviliged douche with parents that doted on him and great friends who hung out with him, and Snape is a poor half-blood millrat who was sorted to the house that was a breeding ground for death eaters, had exactly one friend in teh ideologically opposite house, and the only place he felt he could find some power and sense of belonging was the death eaters. That's cult recruitment from at risk youth 101.
