Voldemort's muggle torture was literally murdering, potentially raping-potentially-and putting them under a curse that inflicts the most pain your body can imagine in literally every fiber of your body.

Were James and Sirius assholes? For sure. What they did to Snape was fucked up. It was not on par with murder and putting someone under a curse that can render someone insane through the amount of pain inflicted on them.

Sirius wanting to kill Snape isn't fully on him. Def was on him, but Snape knew for a fact what was going on, and what would happen when he went. He was actively trying to expose Moony multiple times, never mind later in life when he conveniently forgot the Wolfsbane potion and grabbing the invisibility cloak when it was a full moon. Not the excuses he made for his buddies when Lily called him out for what happened to that girl in their fifth year.

When did they laugh about almost killing people when Remus was a werewolf? Please tell me? James didn't speak to Sirius after he almost got Snape of all people killed, and they literally became animagi to make Remus feel more secure about his position in their friend group as a werewolf.

The fact that your apologism for a dude who would see a family with children dead before finding out it was the girl he creepily obsessed over comes to the point where you claim the Marauders are worse than Voldemort is pathetic
