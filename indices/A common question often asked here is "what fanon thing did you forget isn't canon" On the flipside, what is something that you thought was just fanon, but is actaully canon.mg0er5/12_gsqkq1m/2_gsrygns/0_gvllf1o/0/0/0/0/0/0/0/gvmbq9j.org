  The fact that your apologism for a dude who would see a family with children dead before finding out it was the girl he creepily obsessed over comes to the point where you claim the Marauders are worse than Voldemort is pathetic
#+end_quote

Quote me where I said that xD I /said/ you should rethink your life choices if a much milder version of what you did to a classmate is called literal muggle torture by /Voldemort/

And if you thought I said Marauders were worse than wannabe DEs, you're absolutely right! ðŸ˜‚ It's supported by Sirius himself, in PoA, when he calls marauders the biggest bullies in the playground that was Hogwarts ðŸ˜‚

  Voldemort's muggle torture was literally murdering, potentially raping-potentially-and putting them under a curse that inflicts the most pain your body can imagine in literally every fiber of your body.
#+end_quote

Also, apparently, levicorpusing and twirling of muggle families ðŸ˜‚ I know this is fanfic sub, but you gotta root your fanon in some canon. I'll have to nitpick that that's a lot of potentials there. I already addressed the voldemort point earlier, soðŸ˜‚

  Were James and Sirius assholes? For sure. What they did to Snape was fucked up. It was not on par with murder and putting someone under a curse that can render someone insane through the amount of pain inflicted on them.

Everything is better than extremes like that ðŸ˜‚

  Sirius wanting to kill Snape isn't fully on him. Def was on him, but Snape knew for a fact what was going on,
#+end_quote

Lupin disagrees. Snape suspected, but he only knew when he saw Lupin. It's in PoA. Snape suspected they were doing shady things that they would get expelled for. Not just Lupin. And he was right, ofc. If the school knew they were letting out Lupin from a safehouse to keep others safe from him, they'd probably have been expelled.

And it's kinda funny that Snape's idea of revenge on marauders was telling on them to teachers. Not something you'd expect of a /Dark Wizard/ who knew more spells than half of seventh year when he was in first ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

  When did they laugh about almost killing people when Remus was a werewolf? Please tell me?
#+end_quote

Sure! In PoA:

#+begin_quote
  "That was still really dangerous! Running around in the dark with a werewolf! What if you'd given the others the slip, and bitten somebody?"

  "A thought that still haunts me," said Lupin heavily. "And there were near misses, many of them. We laughed about them afterwards. We were young, thoughtless--carried away with our own cleverness."
#+end_quote

Near misses lol. If any of these misses were nearer, lives would have been destroyed. Putting Lupin in the shack was not for him. It was for others' safety. This was what Snape suspected, that the marauders were doing /something/ and it somehow involved Lupin and the shack where Pomfret was taking him. And it would have gotten them in trouble, most likely expelled, if it was revealed. Lupin knows that. It's why he didn't reveal that Sirius Black had an animagi form. Because he thought DD would deduce it and be disappointed.
