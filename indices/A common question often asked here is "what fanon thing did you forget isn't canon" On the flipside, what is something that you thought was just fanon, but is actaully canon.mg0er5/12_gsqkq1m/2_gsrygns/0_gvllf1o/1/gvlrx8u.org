It is actually said in canon this way - "Well Snape was a special case, he never lost an opportunity to hex James, so you wouldn't expect James to take that lying down, do you"..

The implication seems to be that James calmed down, stopped hexing other people but Snape attacked this time and James retaliated. Depends on how much you want to take Remus and Sirius' word for it though.

And Harry asks if Lily was okay with that, Sirius says " she didn't know too much about it, to tell you the truth. I mean, James didn't take Snape on dates with her and hex in front of her, did he?"

So, yeah, up to interpretation.
