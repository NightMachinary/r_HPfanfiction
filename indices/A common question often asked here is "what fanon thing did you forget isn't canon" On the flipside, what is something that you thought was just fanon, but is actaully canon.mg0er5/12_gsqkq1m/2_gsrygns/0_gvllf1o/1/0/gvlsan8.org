“A special case,” most likely because of their history combined with Snape being friends with DEs. I commented to the other person who responded about it.

I think with the war coming to its height, seventh year would be the time those two would /really/ be going at it, considering Snape was friends with confirmed Death Eaters and beginning to radicalize even further himself. Meanwhile James was clearly moving towards the Order. Who knows?
