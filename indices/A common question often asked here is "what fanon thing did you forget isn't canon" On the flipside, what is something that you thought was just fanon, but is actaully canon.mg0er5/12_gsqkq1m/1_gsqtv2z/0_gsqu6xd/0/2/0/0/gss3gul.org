Fair. I think it's kind of a wil assumption that having kids betters you. It can be pretty harmful, as many people don't change, if the underlying conditions don't. If the reasons that you're immature are still there when you have a kid, it'd be 50:50 on whether it would actually change you for the better or if the reasons will make you be immature again.

Lily and Harry together could have matured him, I think. I guess it just depends on how you interpret him. We know little enough that many things are possible.
