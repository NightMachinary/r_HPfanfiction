Also I would think Lily would kill Snape rather then forgive him for almost getting her entire family murdered if they lived, and for being a Death eater. I don't ever see Lily ever forgiving Snape after they break their friendship, she would treat him as any other Death eater. She realised she was better of without him a a friend years ago why would she allow him back into her life after that.

Lily hadn't been friends with Snape for around 6 years I don't think Lily would forgiven Snape at all, she probably never even thought of him in those 6 years unless it was bad things and she would hold the same disdain for him as any other Death eater. I wonder sometimes what some of the other muggleborn who got called mud blood by Snape thought about Lily hanging around with a racist I doubt they would think to highly of her.
