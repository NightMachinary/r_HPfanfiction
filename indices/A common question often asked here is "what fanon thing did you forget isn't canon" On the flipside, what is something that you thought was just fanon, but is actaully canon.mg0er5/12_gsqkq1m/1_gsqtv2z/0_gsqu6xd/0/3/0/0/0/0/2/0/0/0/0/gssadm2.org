  I really don't want to discuss with Snape apologists
#+end_quote

I'm so sad

#+begin_quote
  Snape was a hero, I don't deny that.
#+end_quote

That's really cool of you. You're one of the few to use those adjectives and still consider him a hero, that's great

#+begin_quote
  But that doesn't make him a good person - he was an obsessive, childish and petty (tending to cruel) person.
#+end_quote

He really wasn't a good person, in the sense that he'd be nice to you. He was all that you said and more. But he was a good guy in the sense of he supported the right ideology. B That's kind of a narrow definition though, so I'll just agree

#+begin_quote
  Doing a good thing doesn't negate the bad things you do.
#+end_quote

I mean, yeah, it doesn't mean everyone should forget what you did. But redemption is all about change that helps you be a better person and right the wrongs that you inflicted in your past, right? Or making up for them by doing good stuff and helping people. If you take a hardline on a person can never negate anything, then what's the motivation to turn over a new leaf?

#+begin_quote
  He joined the magical equivalent of the KKK and took part in their cruelties
#+end_quote

That is what he is redeemed for. The extent to which he was involved is debatable, as is why he joined. It has been repeatedly said that he joined to get power and get a sense of belonging. As a powerless guy who didn't have anyone except those Slytherin peeps, that's actually quite understandable.

#+begin_quote
  while claiming being in love with exact the sort of person they wanted to see dead.
#+end_quote

Well, he didn't join the DEs because he was in love with her, did he? He joined for power. This is actually the very anthesis to him obsessing over her. It's clear he was looking out for himself after school, rather than caring about Lily. It's only after he puts her in danger that he completely gives up his ambitions and promises 'Anything' to Dumbledore for her protection

It's also very debatable how much VW1 was about war against muggleborns, how much Severus knew about their goals, what they used to hook him. Regulus, for example, believed it was about wizards ruling the muggles. Black family was hoodwinked and only truly realised Voldemort's awfulness later. It's a lot to assume a half-blood whose only source of news is the prophet (lol) and his housemates who have families inside death eaters knew about the true unromanticised agenda of DEs xD

And oh, there it is. 'If he truly loved her'. Yeah. You know what he did because he 'truly loved her'? Waited infront of the gryff common room right after he'd been sexually humiliated by gryffindors and threatened to sleep there, just to get a chance to apologise. Went to Dumbledore fully expecting to be killed to warn him of the danger on potters. Promised 'Anything' in return for their protection. Agreed to keep on his miserable role in his teaching position to protect Harry, because he had her eyes, because he was her son

It's amazing that you expect him to forget all his traumas, all his circumstances and ambitions and everything just because 'uf he loved her, he wouldn't do x'. The x is not being done because of his love. It's being done because of the shitty life he's lived and the personality that results from it. The love he feels for her is not her doing. She did not love him, she married his tormentor. His love is his goodness, it's the thing that makes him want to be good in face of all of the badness all his life has predisposed him to.

To take something so pure, so inherently good and twist it beyond recognition because you can't get over how such a person could have loved so purely is so tragic.
