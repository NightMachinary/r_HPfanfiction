I really don't want to discuss with Snape apologists. Snape was a hero, I don't deny that. Without him they wouldn't have won. But that doesn't make him a good person - he was an obsessive, childish and petty (tending to cruel) person. Doing a good thing doesn't negate the bad things you do.

He joined the magical equivalent of the KKK and took part in their cruelties while claiming being in love with exact the sort of person they wanted to see dead. If he really loved Lily he wouldn't have joined a movement that wanted to see her dead.
