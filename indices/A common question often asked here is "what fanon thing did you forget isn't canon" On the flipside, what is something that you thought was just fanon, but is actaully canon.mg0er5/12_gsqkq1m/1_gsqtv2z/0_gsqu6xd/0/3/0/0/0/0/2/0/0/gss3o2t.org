You said he looked after Harry because he had loved lily, and Harry was her son. Thats a completely good thing, lol. The mistreatment is more complex, and though I agree that it was not a good thing to do, seeing Harry as james (even if Harry made it so easy), it doesn't take away much from the goodness of protecting him even though Snape was totally miserable in the position. And Snape did apologise for that (by showing the you only see what you want to memory) so meh

Snape protects Harry because he loved lily. He hates harry, because to him, he's basically mini James. He hates harry because of James. You're unnecessarily mixing the two
