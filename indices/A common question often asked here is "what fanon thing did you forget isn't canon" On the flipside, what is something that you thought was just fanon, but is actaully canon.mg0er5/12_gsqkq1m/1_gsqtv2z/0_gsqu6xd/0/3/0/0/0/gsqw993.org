Seeing how he treats Sirius and Harry, I don't see him growing up. But on the other hand, his grieve could have hindered him growing up like being tossed into Askaban did with Sirius.

I can't imagine him not being bitter - but maybe he would have acted more like an adult.

I am slowly reaching the age Snape was in PS (me being 29 him being 31). I am a teacher and the older I get the more despicable I find Snapes behavior towards his students. I really hope the real teacher JKR based Snape on wasn't that bad.
