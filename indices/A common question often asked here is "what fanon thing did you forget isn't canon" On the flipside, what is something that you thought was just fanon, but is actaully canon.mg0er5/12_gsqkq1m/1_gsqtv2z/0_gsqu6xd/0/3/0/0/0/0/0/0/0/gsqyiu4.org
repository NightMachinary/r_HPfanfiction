I think he was actually worse that Umbridge as a teacher. Umbridge at least only had one year with them. Snape terrorised students for about 20 years and nobody stood up against him like the teachers did against Umbridge. Hagrid even appologised his behavoir in PS. I think it is worse for students if they have a horrible teacher and their collegues defend them.
