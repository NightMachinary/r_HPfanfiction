Remus could have been a better, responsible member of society if it hadn't ostracized him. Even as he is he comes close, despite wanting to abandon his family. Sirius was in prison for 12 years from right after he got out of school, and Pettigrew lived as a rat for just as long. Snape had to live with the man that was most responsible for Lilly's death other than himself (and Voldemort obviously), so he's obviously not going to treat him well, though he definitely had other issues though. None of them other than Snape really got a chance to become a functional, responsible member of society, and Snape was too busy being bitter to do anything close to bettering himself.
