Sirius and Snape shake hands in the second last chapter of Goblet of Fire. But that wasn't their decision - Dumbledore made them do that. I remember that scene because I laught out loud the first time I read it. They were behaving like children - and that was exactly how Dumbledore treated them.

James did stop pranking and tormenting students, that is canon. Him growing up was the reason why Lily stopped ignoring him.
