Most everything regarding being an Animagus. Mostly the process (the Marauders had to keep a leaf in their mouth for 30 days and nobody noticed?) but also the 'you don't get to pick what animal you turn into' aspect. Given how conveniently useful the forms both the Marauders (two to keep Lupin in check, one small and agile enough to stop the Whomping Willow) and Rita had, I'd really thought you got to pick.
