Further to MajinCloud's explanation Nagini is a /Maledictus/ (literally 'cursed' in Latin?). She carries a bloodline curse. She can turn into a snake, but she can only turn back into a human a certain (unknown) number of times. One day she will turn into a snake and not be able to turn back.

As an audience we don't know whether she will keep her human mind once the curse is fully realised.

Unfortunately for her, when we first meet her she is trapped in a magical circus/freakshow and is being forced to turn into a snake by the ringmaster.

One of my favourite Keira Marcos stories incorporates Nagini's story, in a tiny way, to touching effect.
