I don't accept the Pottermore explanation of the Animagus process because it's more potions and ritual based when it's /supposed/ to be achieved by very in-depth study of transfiguration. There's one spell that's needed, but it doesn't seem like something that would highlight McGonagall's mastery of the subject.
