If you've ever tried making corn masa from a recipe, you'll remember that the recipes are ludicrously paranoid about the hydrated lime you use to process the corn. They act like it's going to jump up and chew off your face. It's not. Hydrated lime would be bad to get in your eyes, but heck, I wouldn't want to get dried corn in my eyes either.

If you've talked to people who preserve food by canning it and learned how from parents, especially when the people live outside the US, they often use canning processes way less careful than what the USDA recommends. People used to seal jam jars by pouring melted paraffin wax on top of hot jam in a jar, and in some places, people still do. And they hardly ever die. The USDA recommendations are written so an idiot making a halfhearted attempt at following the recipe will still be fine.

And if you've ever compared lab safety guidelines to a Cody's Lab video, you'll know that an expert can often substitute skill for the precautions that guidelines recommend.

I wouldn't be shocked if the official method for becoming an Animagus has a lot of idiot-proofing and ass-covering, and a person who knows what they're doing (or is willing to accept some risk) can skip most of the difficult and time-consuming steps.
