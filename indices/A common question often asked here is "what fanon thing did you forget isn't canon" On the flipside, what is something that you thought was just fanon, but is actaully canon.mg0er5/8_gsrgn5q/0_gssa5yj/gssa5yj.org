The concept of the IRL outhouse and chamberpot was arguably much the same, I suspect that is where JK got the inspiration. As Terry Pratchett put it, when the pit was full you moved the outhouse a few yards away and dug a new pit. As for chamberpots, you went to a corner of a private room and used it and that was that.

So, as a wizard, all you need to do is pretty much the same, though with /Evanesco/ actually lots more hygienic. It's an exaggeration of course to shit exactly where one stood regardless of whatever's going on around one, but otherwise the concept is about the same.
