That's a good point. But what gets me is what you said at last, because the way JK explained it sounded that way.

So it results in absurd situations, like for example, a teacher deciding to stop their class for a moment to take a shit behind their desk, then vanish it, and continue the class as if nothing.

Thats just wrong.
