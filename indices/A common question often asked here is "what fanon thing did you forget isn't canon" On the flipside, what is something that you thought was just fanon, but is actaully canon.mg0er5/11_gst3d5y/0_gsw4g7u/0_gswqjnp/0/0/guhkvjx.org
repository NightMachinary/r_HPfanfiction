Is what it is. She died to me. Magic has limits and people were so busy staying alive they might not have noticed a blood drenched, pale, unmoving, half /possibly/ alive body. Maybe that's my pessimistic outlook coming to play though. And if you look it up it does say J.K Rowling was always involved with the movies and making sure they stayed true to adaption. She was, “always in the loop before any movie was released”. I'd stay that is strong evidence that Lavender died but with the shit show J.K has included herself in maybe Lavender is alive and J.K just didn't care enough to fix the mistake. Personally I think she's dead.
