+Bellatrix having a child with Voldemort+

But the Cursed Sequel aside, I had completely forgotten about:

- Buckbeak the Hippogriff continuing to live in Grimmauld Place with Sirius for an unspecified amount of time after POA

- Grawp and Trelawney featuring in the final battle for Hogwarts - and, for that matter, Buckbeak

- As discussed in a recent post on this sub, Fleur Delacour being /a literal teenager still/ when she marries Bill Weasley - who has 5 or 6 years on her (yikes)

- Wizards not wearing pants/trousers under their robes
