It would depend on when she was born. She got married in summer DH, so she would need to have a birthday before the end of October - when it was established she was 17 in Goblet - to be 20 by then and not still 19.

17 at end Oct GOF, 18 at end Oct Order, 19 at end Oct HBP. Unless her 20th birthday falls before end July of the DH school year, she's still 19 when she gets married, because she'll not definitively be 20 until end Oct of that year.
