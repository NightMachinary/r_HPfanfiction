I don't think it was that common in the UK to marry at 19 or 20. Early 20s, definitely. It has crept up by today for a number of factors. But I think 19 or 20 would have caused raised eyebrows.

The marriage of Prince Charles to a then-19 year old Princess Diana, for example, in the early 80s, had a lot of talk about her age.

Anyway, I don't want to get into an argument about it. The core of my initial post which several people seem to agree with is that it's easy to forget how young Fleur is when she gets married to Bill, which suggests the text doesn't draw attention to it, which suggests either JKR was deliberately trying to skate over it, or that Fleur as written didn't read like a 19 or 20 year old young woman - the latter was my interpretation. If I hadn't remembered this and had been asked blind how Fleur came across age wise, I would have said around 22 or 23.
