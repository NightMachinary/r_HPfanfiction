I can get on board with your second point to an extent. My parents got married in 1996 when they were 26 - definitely not old but not that young - and when I was born in 1998 my mum was considered a geriatric mother even though she hadn't turned 28 yet. So yeah I think there was still a bit of an expectation to marry and pop out kids young in the uk even in the late 90's. Obviously not everyone did but a decent enough number that it's quite clear to see the correlation.
