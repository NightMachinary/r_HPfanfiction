Personally I find it strange and too early anyway, but that's just my morality & personal.

The wider issue for me is that it's really odd/poor planning for JK Rowling to establish that wizards have a lifespan about 1.5x a normal human and yet has very few living grandparents/great-grandparents /and/ a fixation on multiple characters marrying straight out of school, barely or not even in their 20s.
