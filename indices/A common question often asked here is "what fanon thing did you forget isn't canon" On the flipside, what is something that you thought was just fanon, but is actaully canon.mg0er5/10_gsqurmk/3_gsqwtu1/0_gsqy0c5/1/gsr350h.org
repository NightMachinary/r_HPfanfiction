Fleur was a 7th year in GoF (she was working at Gringotts in OotT), so her birthday is no later than August 31 (assuming Beauxbatons has the same cutoff). She /could/ still have been 19, but it's much more likely she was 20.

Anyway, 19 or 20 is perfectly legal in both worlds, and Bill was officially 26 when he got married, so 20 is even acceptable under the "half age plus seven" creepiness rule.
