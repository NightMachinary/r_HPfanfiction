I keep forgetting that Remus/Sirius aren't canon and I keep forgetting that Ron/Hermione are canon. I also read so many death eater fanfictions that I genuinely forget that Voldemort didn't win and Harry isn't dead or on his side lol. Oh and anything to do with the marauders - I have absolutely no clue if it's canon or fanon

Edit: I honestly don't understand why I got downvoted for answering a question :( /g
