I'm not quite sure what you mean. If I don't enjoy a fic because it's low quality or I'm just not into it, I stop reading it. In fact, I have pretty much enjoyed every fic I've read and I continue reading them over and over because I enjoy them so much. So I generally don't understand how this is about how the quality is? /g

Also I was just answering a question that someone asked everyone in this sub. I honestly feel really judged and quite a bit upset, in fact more than that, because I don't think I said anything that would upset anyone. All I wanted yo do was join in and give my answer:( /g
