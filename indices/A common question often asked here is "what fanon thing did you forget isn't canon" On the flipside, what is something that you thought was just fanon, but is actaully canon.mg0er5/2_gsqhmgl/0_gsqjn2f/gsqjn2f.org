I think that is something Rowling herself forgot about. In OotP when Harry is not made a prefect he is relieved to hear that his father wasn't one either. But wow, James was the Head Boy... Funny thing Sirius didn't mention about it when he said that he didn't become a prefect because he was in detention too many times with James.
