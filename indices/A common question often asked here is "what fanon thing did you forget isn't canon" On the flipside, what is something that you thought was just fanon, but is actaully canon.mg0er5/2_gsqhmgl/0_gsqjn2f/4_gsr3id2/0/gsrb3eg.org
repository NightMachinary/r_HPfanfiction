Yeah, I definitely don't see a situation where 6th year students just decide not to return to Hogwarts. But, I do see a situation where a student could decide that they don't want to be Head Boy, ex: I could definitely see Remus either not enjoying being a prefect and thus not wanting to become Head Boy or deciding that he had too much on his plate academically and wanted to focus more on his classes instead. Or feeling guilty about being a werewolf, and after the events of their 6th year deciding he didn't want to be in such a role of authority.
