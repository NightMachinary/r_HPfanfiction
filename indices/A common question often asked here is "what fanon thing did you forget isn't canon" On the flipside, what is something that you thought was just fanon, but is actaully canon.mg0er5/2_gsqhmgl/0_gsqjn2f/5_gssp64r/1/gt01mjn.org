There was a problem also with the translation to my native language. In /the Philosopher's Stone/ it is never told what a Head Boy/Girl actually is. As a result, the translation was "the best boy/girl". In my language titles are not capitalised, and I didn't understand that "the best boy/girl" is a title and not just a compliment. When /the Prisoner of Azkaban/ was translated, the translator knew that the Head Boy and Girl are the leaders of the prefects, and the translation was changed to "leader boy/girl", making it obvious that it is a title. (It was probably changed in later editions of PS, but I haven't read them.) James was never again mentioned being the Head Boy, and I was really confused when I read a few years ago from the Harry Potter Wiki that he had been one.
