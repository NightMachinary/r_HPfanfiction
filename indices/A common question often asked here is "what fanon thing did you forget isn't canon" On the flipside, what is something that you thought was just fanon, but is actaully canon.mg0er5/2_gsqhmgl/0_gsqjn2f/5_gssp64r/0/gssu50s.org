It's sometimes hard to translate, especially if a country does not have a school system resembling English one. In Slovenian, prefects are translated as "Student representative" which would be similar to class president and a member of student council while Head boy/Girl is translated as President/Head of student council (They are the ones that have regular meeting with headmaster, head of faculty and head of parent council).
