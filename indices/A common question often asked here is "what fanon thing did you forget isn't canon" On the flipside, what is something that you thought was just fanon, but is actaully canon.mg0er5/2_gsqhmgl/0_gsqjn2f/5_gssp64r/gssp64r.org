That is something funny. I was really surprised when I found out James had been Headboy. Because in my native language (in which I read the books for the first times), Headboy translates to something like "Head Prefect". You have Prefect, which translates to "Monitor" and the Headboy/Headgirl which translatea to '"Monitor Chefe" (and it is not a cooking lizard). So I always assumed that a Headboy/Headgirl was an outstanding Prefect. But when I found out about James, and I already knew he hadnt been a prefect I assumed otherwise. That it's like that (British?) school culture of Headboys/Headgirls being popular students or something to that effect.

Edit: grammar.
