Yup.

I am not a fan of Draco in general, I don't really agree with Rowling's 'he reformed' thing. He's always been a racist pissant to me, him not killing Dumbledore was more about cowardice. He didn't seem to care about nearly killing Katie or Ron.

But nevertheless, stories where he has become a good guy and Harry and Draco having to interact are hilarious.

One of my fav time travel stories actually deals with this. Harry and Draco are partners at work, they were auror partners and DoM partners or such (it's been a while). Vitriolic best buds/snarky buddies. Then an accident sends them back in time to their childhood bodies.

It's full of wonderful snark.

I wish the author's update more.
