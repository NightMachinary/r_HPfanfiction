I relate to it so much. Many use the characters Marlene and Dorcas in Marauders fanfictions (and Mary, but this comment is not about her) as Lilys friends. I always imagined Dorcas blond and Marlene black haired. But in so many fanfictions its the complete opposite and i just can't imagine it that way
