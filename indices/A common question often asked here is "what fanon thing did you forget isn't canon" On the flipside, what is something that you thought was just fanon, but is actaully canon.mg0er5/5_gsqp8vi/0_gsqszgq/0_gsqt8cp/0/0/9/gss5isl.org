There was this old HPLexicon article that tried to guess characters' regional origins and appearance by using a mix of interpreting their names and using UK regional demographics and Daphne was said to be from a region with a lot of blondes. So she's always been blonde to me and I was not surprised that her sister turned out to be Scorpius's mum.
