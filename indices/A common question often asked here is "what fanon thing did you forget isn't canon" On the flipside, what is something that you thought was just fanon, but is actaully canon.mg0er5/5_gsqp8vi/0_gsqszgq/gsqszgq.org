She's "real" in so much as she existed. She is mentioned in a list of people taking their OWL in book five, I believe. That's her sole mention, though Rowling's said she was Slytherin I recall.

Thus why she's used so much in fanfic, she's a totally blank slate. Pansy was a bitch and hanger on to Draco, Millicent was "mean" to Hermione in book two, and such.
