It's not 100% clear, but /Prisoner of Azkaban/ definitely suggests there are five girls as well as five boys. Their DADA lesson with Lupin has the boggart change into nine different forms, but only seven named people face it. Harry and Hermione both don't, and only Gryffindor students get points. So since Harry, Ron, Neville, Dean and Seamus are the only boys, the extra two must be girls.
