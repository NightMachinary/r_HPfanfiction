It's literally called the Marauder's Map, not the Marauders' Map - the apostrophe does make a difference in its meaning. I've read that she didn't intend for it to be an official group name for them but then eventually made it canon because fans interpreted it that way, hence why they're not referred to as The Marauders until that line in the sixth book.
