I'm hoping you're a troll because otherwise I'm going to judge you pretty hard for not reading the books. (I'm sorry but books >>> movies)

I know they butchered the Marauders reveal in the PoA movie (and by butchered I mean Texas chainsaw massacre style) but it's literally called the Marauders' Map. Which I suppose was also mostly ignored in the movies.

Ugh. This is why all the movies from GoF on I saw once if at all. (GoF once, OotP once, HBP never, DH 1&2 both incomplete)
