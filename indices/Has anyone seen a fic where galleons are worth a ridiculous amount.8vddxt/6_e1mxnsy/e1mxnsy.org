I'm not sure how "economy breaking" a real exchange rate would be. I'm using it in my own fics, but in the 90s, an ounce of gold was somewhere between 200 and 300 pounds, leaving you with relatively normal amounts of money. The Weasleys win 200,000 GBP while Harry gets 250,000 from the Triwizard Tournament. An average Ministry salary would be 10000-20000 GBP/month. That's rich, but not "broken" level of rich.
