Seeing that actually used would be a deal-breaker for me, because while I can suspend my disbelief for magic, I can't suspend my disbelief far enough to allow for non-greedy, ethically-sound bankers who wouldn't debase the currency at the slightest excuse.

If they keep the exchange rate low - presumably by treaty at the end of one of the goblin wars - the goblins /will/ devalue the coinage so as to not lose money. They don't even have to adulterate the metal: take five quid's worth of gold - a bit over one two-hundredth of an ounce at today's prices - use an engorgement and reverse a lightweight charm, and you've got a coin that satisfies the treaty-mandated sterling exchange rate and gives the goblins their gold back. Trying to melt the coins down for their bullion value breaks the charms and your crucible full of galleons becomes a teaspoonful of molten gold.

It's Gresham's Law, Magical remix: bad money magically replaces good money.

(Headcanon: Goblins aren't, of their nature, necessarily greedy unpleasant dishonest backstabbing little shits. It's just that all the goblins humans ever meet are bankers, and bankers with a monopoly at that. There are plenty of perfectly nice goblins, they just live two miles down and don't ever come to the surface.)

(Also headcanon: the MaCUSA Dragot doesn't have a treaty-mandated dollar value and became the US Magical community's equivalent of the Krugerrand. With the repeal of the Rappaport Laws in 1966 they discovered that everything was cheaper on the nonmagical side, and selling their Dragots for their bullion value made them, for a few years, able to live much higher on the hog than they had been doing. The Nomaj economy noticed the sudden influx of gold, and in 1971 the Gold-US Dollar Exchange standard was formally ended in response.)
