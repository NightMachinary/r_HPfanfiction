That makes it /more/ likely that the coins are magically debased, not less. Measures taken to prevent them being melted down make the debasement less detectable, giving greater incentive to do it. Measures taken to stop them circulating out into a third party economy also help in that regard.

It really becomes a suspension-of-disbelief problem if you know anything about economics. There's a /reason/ no nation in human history has turned over fiscal seigniorage to a recently-hostile foreign power, still less to the bankers thereof. Even if you discount every last jot and tittle of the anti-goblin racism of british wizards, the goblins still have a strong incentive to ensure that the Galleon has as little gold in it as possible. Without magic, the wretched things would have only a bit higher gold content than seawater, as Pterry Pratchett memorably described the Ankh-Morpork Dollar. /With/ magic, the opportunities for fraud just get shinier.

A sensible wizard would keep his gold and silver in the form of Kruggerands and Maria Theresas - want to bet that assaying charms are a thing? - and buy Galleons only when he had to after selling bullion to get Bank of England paper that has a treaty-mandated exchange rate.

This is, of course, why Galleons, Sickles and Knuts are still widely used: everyone knows they're cheap goblin crap, but Bad Money Drives Out Good because all the good money is stashed in vaults as a store of value, only converted for current account needs.

Esprit d'Escalier edit: This is why the Weasleys come off as so poor. Arthur thinks he must, as a Ministry official, treat the Galleon as good coin and thinks that dealing off the treaty-mandated, goblin-controlled economy is somehow underhanded, so he just puts up with the screwy prices and the bizarre disjunction between them and wages (wizards went their own way a century before muggles invented trade unions, after all). The man may be fascinated with muggles, but he hasn't ever picked up one of our economics textbooks... mMeanwhile, the likes of the Malfoys have their wealth stored in land, bullion and fine art and can treat Galleons as a cheap currency they can pass off on dipsticks like Fudge who are impressed by the illusion of wealth.
