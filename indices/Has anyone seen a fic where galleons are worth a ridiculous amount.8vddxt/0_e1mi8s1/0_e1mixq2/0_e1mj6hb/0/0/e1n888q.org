  Were coins relatively uniform, or were they closer to chips of a valued metal at a certain weight?

The monarch's head thing has already been answered, but go look at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coining_(mint)]] - in summary, you cut out a metal disc, put it on an engraved planchet, rest an engraved die on it, and administer a mighty wallop with a hammer. The engraved designs would last a few hundred or a few thousand coins before starting to blur, and the design wouldn't go all the way to the edge so coin-clippers would shear off the excess*. And the King/Emperor/Grand High Poo-Bah would be adding more and more base metal to the bullion to make it go further (you can trace the decline of the Roman Empire by the silver content of the denarius: they were pretty much pure pot metal by the end.)

*\ this was, of course, a crime, since it reduced the weight of the coin below honest levels while leaving the state guarantee of value intact, so you were basically making a liar out of the king. The penalty for which in 17th century England was hanging, drawing and quartering if male, or burning at the stake if female.
