Slightly off topic I suppose, but what was involved with minting and counterfeiting currency back in the day?

Were coins relatively uniform, or were they closer to chips of a valued metal at a certain weight?

Was stamping a monarch's face on the currency done for a long time, or is that a relatively recent thing?
