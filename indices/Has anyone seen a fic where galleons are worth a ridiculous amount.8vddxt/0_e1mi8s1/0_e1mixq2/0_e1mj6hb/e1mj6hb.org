It's more knowing a lot about historical shenanigans with minting, seigniorage, debasement of currency, counterfeiting, bills of exchange and promissory notes, exchange-and-deposit goldsmithing, coin-clipping and allied trades. Add the increased capabilities of magic to the long and apparently inevitable history of fiscal chicanery and there are possibilities that are just too obvious not to be common practise.
