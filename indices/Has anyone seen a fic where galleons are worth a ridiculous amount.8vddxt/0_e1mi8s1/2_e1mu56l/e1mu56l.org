I always imagined that goblin coins are indestructible and therefore it doesn't matter how much gold they contain, you couldn't melt them down for arbitrage. Maybe the goblin magic that makes them indestructible only works on pure, unenchanted materials so the goblins would always have to use the full amount of gold, which would mean they couldn't create money from nothing, and the wizards still couldn't abuse the ridiculous exchange rates. That still leaves the problem that the goblins would have to buy the gold at a rate that is far above what they get when they make galleons from it. And even if they get all their gold from the Egyptian tombs they plunder, that still wouldn't explain why they don't just sell it to muggles at a higher rate...

Then while writing this I stumbled upon another question: How is new money introduced to the wizarding world? The goblins employ wizards like Bill for cursebreaking but that can't be the only thing or it would skew the economy dramatically. Physical money is lost all the time, even if it's indestructible and I'd wager that wizards generally tend to increase the gold in their vaults over their lifespan if they can. Not introducing enough new money should thus lead to heavy revaluation, and only introducing new money by paying gringotts employees should make those quite powerful. At least that's how I understand it from googling about economics for about 5 minutes :^)
