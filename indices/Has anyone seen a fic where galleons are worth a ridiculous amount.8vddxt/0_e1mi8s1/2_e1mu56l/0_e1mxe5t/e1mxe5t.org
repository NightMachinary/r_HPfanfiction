New money is probably introduced through similar mechanisms to Muggle economics - Gringotts mints new coins, offers loans to individuals and businesses that spend the newly minted coins and get them in circulation. The Ministry could play a large role in this - they might sell bonds to Gringotts, paid for using new coins, and the revenue from the bonds are used to pay Ministry employees, vendors, etc.
