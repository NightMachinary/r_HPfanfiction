I recently read a fanfiction in which people assumed the galleon is made from pure gold - to which one of the MCs pointed out, that the Goblins were quite aware of the Muggle Gold Standard Price per Ounce, thus, they - sneakily - replaced the Gold-Galleon with a rune-inscribed cheaper Alloy that still weighted exactly one ounce and looked like gold - but did actually cost barely anthing.

But yeah: I totally agree that there are quite a few too many fanfictions that try to fill 1-2 chapters with ridiculous ideas over how to cheat the Goblins/Wizarding World out of money.\\
Like... duh.

That one cross-over in which FemHarry leaves Britain behind, and the goblins are like "Yeah look we usually burn the silly paper muggles use to pay with, because its no gold" and FemHarry is like "Imma give you 5 Galleons for all the paper you have now and all you get over the next year, deal"? Goblins: "Deal bitch".

There is tons of weird Money-related Stuff out there
