i was thinking more about the gold source itself being somehow magical, and the goblins having a monopoly on mining the magic gold veins.

the idea actually brings to mind neal stephenson's baroque cycle. theres a plot point where a bunch of groups are chasing down a cache of “solomonic gold”, “alchemical gold”, or “heavy gold”, which has physical properties (such as weight) that mark it out as different from the normal stuff. theres a scene where a mysterious alchemist uses some of it to create a healing elixir.
