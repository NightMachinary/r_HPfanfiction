Yeah, I've seen that excuse used a few times- one where they were lead coins only spelled to look like gold, and that and many more have the gold coins impervious to melting and damage- which makes me wonder why no one has made armor out of galleons- maybe by sticking them to clothes with a sticking charm or something.

It'd be expensive sure, but you'd be invincible to all but the goblins.
