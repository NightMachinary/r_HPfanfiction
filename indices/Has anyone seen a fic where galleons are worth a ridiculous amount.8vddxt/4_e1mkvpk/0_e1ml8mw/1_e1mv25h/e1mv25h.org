Physical armour is rather useless in most fights, since there enough spells that can be used on the environment to affect an armoured opponent, and any strong enough curse could probably bypass it. Since you can't melt the galleons into your armour there would always be small holes that might leave spells through. And Any spell with kinetic force would still throw you around. The Armour would be quite heavy, making dodging harder (and since the galleons are spell resistant you couldn't even charm them featherlight). Armour on your arms would slow down your casting. You probably wouldn't want to put armour in front of your face and if you do then you would probably leave at least slits for the eyes, through which spells could enter, and hitting them wouldn't even be that hard with you being so slowed down from all the gold your carrying. And the Killing Curse would probably still get you anyways.
