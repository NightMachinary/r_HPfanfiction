Hmm...well, if you start with the raw gold...titanium-alloy it for strength, flatten it out into a thin ribbon, inscribe that thin ribbon of titanium-gold with runic code for protection, anti-duplication, anti-theft, self-stacking-and-sorting, and self-auditing enchantments, then roll that ribbon up into a spiral, plate the top and bottom with titanium-gold circles with more runes on the underside and coin information (goblin head, date of production, etc) on the outside...

The cost of gold, titanium, labour, any potions for enchantment, that should properly make an expensive galleon.
