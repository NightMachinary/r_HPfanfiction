Yes, it were up to me, I would have Goblins charging Wizards an obscene bid-ask spread in GBP:Galleon exchange rates:

If Wizards want to exchange GBP into Galleon, they will cough up whatever 1 Oz of gold cost in GBP at the time. In the 1990s, 1 Oz of gold generally cost 200 GBPs. Nowadays, it's about 1000.

If Wizards want to exchange Galleon into GBP, they used to get a rate of 5 in the 1990s. Now it's 25, reflecting the rise of gold in terms of GBP.

Muggles who only need to change a limited amount of GBP into Galleon got a rate of 5 in the 1990s and 25 today.
