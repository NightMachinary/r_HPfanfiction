I write a /lot/ about Regulus!

I have a similar interpretation to you: that he took after Orion while Sirius was a lot like Walburga (and Bellatrix).

My Regulus was a quiet, intelligent, and gentle child. He longed for affection and attention from his parents. As an extrovert, Sirius got attention by acting out - but as an introvert, Regulus did his best to live up to his parents' expectations of him.

No doubt he accepted what he was told about pureblood supremacy (how could he not, when he would almost certainly have never interacted with a muggle-born let alone a muggle before Hogwarts?) but was quite insecure about his place among the 'Noble' Blacks as the youngest, quietest and most desperate to please member of the family. I imagine Black family gatherings as a host of elderly aunts and uncles muttering about the shortcomings of the youths, and while his three cousins were old enough and Sirius bold enough to shake off their comments, Regulus probably struggled quite a lot.

Of course, a big turning point was when Sirius went to Hogwarts. Regulus was alone with his parents for the first time, and no doubt there were a lot of fights about Sirius's placement in Gryffindor, and then when he came home Regulus would have to listen to his stories about his new mate James. I'm sure Regulus felt a lot of anger and resentment towards James as he imagined him stealing his brother away from him.

As for joining the Death Eaters, I don't believe at all that it was about blood supremacy (I like to think he would have understood how ridiculous that was when he was at school and saw the brilliance, even in Slytherin, of students who weren't pureblood) but more a combination of peer pressure and family expectations. His parents never joined, but Bellatrix and Lucius would have been extolling the Dark Lord's virtues and I imagine Walburga thinking it an excellent way to toughen her sensitive boy up. And I always picture Bellatrix taking control of Regulus's Death Eater training before he reached 17, to his horror.

I imagine his later years at Hogwarts being full of anxiety about where his life was headed, frustration at the adults in his life either taking control and making decisions for him (Walburga, Bellatrix) or failing to help him at all (Orion, perhaps even Dumbledore?) and worry about what Sirius was getting into and whether they would end up facing each other on the battlefield.

I think, ultimately, he just wants to be accepted and liked/loved for who he is, not who his parents push him to be or his brother wants him to be or his peers expect him to be. I think Voldemort's abuse of Kreacher was the last straw that made him snap, and I fully believe that he knew he would not walk out of that cave alive.

He's a tragic character with amazing potential, and I wish JKR had written more about him, but I have a lot of fun trying to fill in the gaps!
