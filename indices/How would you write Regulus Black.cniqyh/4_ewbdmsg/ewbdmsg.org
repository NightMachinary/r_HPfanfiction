I don't think of Regulus as a good or bad guy but as a kid who passively accepted his parents' beliefs without much questioning until he joined Death Eaters and had his "sixth-year Draco 'I'm-In-Deep-Shit' Malfoy" moment. I still think he believed in pureblood supremacy until the day he died, but he wasn't cruel and didn't want to personally hurt people.

His childhood must have been very lonely. He probably held a lot of resentment towards Sirius and felt that his older brother had abandoned him for his Gryffindor friends. Walburga and Orion are implied to be abusive, though probably in a different way to Regulus than to Sirius. His cousins are all too old to hang out with them. So the closest person in the family for him was Kreacher, who probably showed him more love than both of his parents together.

One time I wrote him, I wrote him as a hopeless romantic, a gentle soul who would however do some daring and ridiculous things for the object of his affections, but it was for a comedy fic.
