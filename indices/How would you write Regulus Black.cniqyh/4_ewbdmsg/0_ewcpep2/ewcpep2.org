I think he could have been thinking like I know I am superior is that not enough why all the violence and killing.

Regulus was railroaded grew up in a family with them beliefs, and then get sorted into a house that is just soaking with those beliefs,

I think Regulus had a kindness to him and while he was already feeling disillusioned after leaving school and joining the war, Kreachers treatment was the last step, Regulus must also be decently well read as he knew what a horcrux was, so I Imagine before he went to the cave he did some research and then decided to end his life trying to make voldemort mortal.

Regulus was still super young when he died and I have a feeling if he lived he would Join the order in the second war.

I can picture regulus being heart broken about turning against voldemort and then ''discovering'' his older brother had Joined Voldemort and betrayed the Potters
