I would write him like a more talented Draco Malfoy as a child and preteen. As a teenager...definitely passive and observant, but not necessarily quite. A mama's boy all his life for sure who allows himself to be swayed by his overbearing mother and outrageously violent cousin. He envies his brother's courage a bit.
