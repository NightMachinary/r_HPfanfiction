I've always imagined him as a whiny momma's boy. Who gets a swift kick up the ass, just not in time to fix his life.

He's basically had his whole life on a silver spoon, always been the indulged child, probably never felt actual consequences for his actions. And at school lived in his brothers shadow.

Especially based on book 7, I've felt that he was that irresponsible teenager who when the real world kicked them in the ass in adulthood. Went oh crap I screwed everything up and trying frantically to fix it before the whole life goes down the toilet.

I think he definitely learned humility in Voldemort's death eaters and found his humanity and selflessness towards the end.
