Regulus could be written into really excellent character, but you have two obstacles to make:

1. Write convincing Death Eater. He must be really nasty, racist without any reservations (not all those Snapes who look like teddy-bears in denial), and yet you must explain convincingly why anybody would be such person, so that normal readers (with normal ethical etc. sensibilities) are able to accept it as a possible (even though unacceptable).
2. Write convincing turning around. Again, not all those cheesy Snapes “Oh, loving, not hating! That's what I was missing.”, but really somebody who is sick from himself and founds a way out of it. Why? What happened?

The end itself could be probably classical Racine-like: sacrificing himself for the welfare of community (or is it Corneille?).
