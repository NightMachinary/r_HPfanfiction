What we know is that he was his mother's favourite, he joined the Death Eaters and was seeker for Slytherin. He was almost certainly raised to believe in in both the superiority of the Black family and of purebloods in general. Being seeker on his house team likely added to that, Bellatrix being such a powerful witch would also have pointed towards the Blacks being strong. He was also young and therefore almost certainly an arrogant little shit. He was a teenager raised on an ideology of bigotry who willingly joined a murder cult and started to discover the real world wasn't quite what his mother made out and then his house-elf was tortured. I would imagine Malfoy but instead of going to his father he dealt with his own problems.
