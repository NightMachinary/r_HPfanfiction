  He is like Snape in that regard, if his catalytic event does not happen, he'd happily continue being a Death Eater.

While that is true to some degree I think we can give Regulus the benefit of the doubt (for lack of having definitive knowledge), while on the other hand for Snape we cannot. For example we can imagine Regulus being conflicted when he found himself on the other side of his brother, while Snape put himself purposely on the side of those who want to eradicate people like Lily.
