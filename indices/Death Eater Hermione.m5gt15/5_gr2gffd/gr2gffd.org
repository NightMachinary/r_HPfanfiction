I don't have anything but wanted to tell you it's not such a ridiculous idea. According to JK, Voldemort tried to recruit anyone that he found useful. That's why he tried to recruit Lily as well. I don't think that, as a half-blood, he has many qualms about who joins him. The whole blood purity is just a story he sells to his inner circle, just like he promises more souls for the Dementors and protection from wizards to the giants or fresh meat for the werewolves.
