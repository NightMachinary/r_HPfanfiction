There's a funny scene in HPMOR where Harry notices that Draco has Crabbe and Goyle as bodyguards (Harry calls them "minions") and asks where he can get some himself. However he doesn't get a usable answer.

Later on in the book, Harry (against his own wishes) gets Lesath Lestrange (Bellatrix's son) as a minion. But I think the book doesn't do enough with this.
