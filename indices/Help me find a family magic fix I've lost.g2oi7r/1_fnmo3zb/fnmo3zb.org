I remember this story, except I don't remember the title or author. Grrr.

Harry's Magic was broken so he had been exiled from the magical world. I think there was a gathering of friends in a pub to celebrate something (possibly Hermione's birthday) and Harry had been invited, but some other people objected to Harry being there and then Aurors came to chase him away over the objections of his friends?

I do know that it was traditional to pass on crystal balls from mother to daughter. They're supposed to show who you will marry? But Molly had more than one, so she'd spelled one to show Ron to Hermione and given it to her as a present except it opened a portal that she and Harry fell through.
