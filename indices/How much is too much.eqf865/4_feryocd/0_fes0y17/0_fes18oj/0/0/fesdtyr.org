That picture's gravy is very light, I prefer my milk gravy darker than that. I prefer brown gravy over almost any milk gravy though.

I'm an aide at a secondary school, someday I'd love to become a full teacher but other priorities take precedence.

I believe if I ever traveled to Great Britain, I know enough of the differences to not make a complete fool of myself. I want to learn more if you'll teach me. I know what I do from fanfiction (my copy of the HP books are Americanized unfortunately), Dr. Who, and some British classical literature. I will probably never be able to move to Norway, but I'd like to travel to see where my ancestors (according to ancestry DNA website). Even if we stick to Norway, Iceland, and Sweden knowing what they mean in English would make things easier. I'm learning Bokm√•l (Norwegian) via Duolingo which supposedly close enough to Swedish and Icelandic to be vaguely understood in the other two countries. Honestly, I think I'm too embarrassed to go to England. But seeing Ireland has been a dream since I was 6.
