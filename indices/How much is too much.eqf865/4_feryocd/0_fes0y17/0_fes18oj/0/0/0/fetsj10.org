Brown gravy and tea will be enough to make you fit in with any British mealtime. :)

Heh. That's quite understandable. Life so often gets in the way of you actually doing what you want with it.

I'd be willing to answer any questions you have, sure. I can only give you a Northern English view, though. I've only been to the South once in my life. Same with Ireland, actually. My family are from Donegal (the North-west) of Ireland and I regularly spend summers there, but I've never been down south there either.

I've also travelled across Scandinavia and between a good map and a good pocket dictionary/guidebook you'll be fine. Knowing English is very common in European Countries generally and Scandinavia is no different. So long as you make an effort to speak the language, most people will be happy and friendly to you. If memory serves, Norway has the most range of dialects and that'll cause some bother, but all the Scandinavian languages are very sing-songy and broadly similar enough that you'll find it easier to move from one to another.

I'm told a couple of good tv shows to watch if you're interested in modern British culture are Shameless and Skins. I've not seen much of either myself, they're a little grungy for my taste in entertainment, but they're very good looks at some of the culture here.
