Sure. Happy to help wherever I can. My work is currently getting in the way, so I might not be instantaneously available, but I'll do my best to help.

And I have! Had to schlep all the way up to a place in Lapland that I can't quite remember how to spell to see it, but it was worth it. Truly spectacular sight.
