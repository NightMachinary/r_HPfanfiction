Yeah, you're right about that. I still have to pause and think about it whenever I hear the new version, though. Old habits die hard and all that. I've never heard of a Primary School being an Elementary School yet, but as I'm twenty-three and not employed in Education, I don't spend any time around primary schools. I only go past my secondary school because it's on my bus route. :)

Me either. I've never really seen anyone do it aside from linking to other places. ¯_(ツ)_/¯

I googled it though, and I have to say it really looks like a scone in Peppercorn Sauce. Our gravy tends to be darker brown. Whatever the liquid, it does make more sense to cover or crumble though. Dipping them is just unwieldy. I think our closest equivalent for that is Dumplings. Doughy-floury, slightly-squished sphere-things. We do dip those and have them in different ways with gravy, but scones are just jam and butter. :)
