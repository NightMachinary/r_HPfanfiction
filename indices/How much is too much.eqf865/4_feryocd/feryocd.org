I mean, so long as you don't start calling them solicitors instead of lawyers, you're probably okay. The rest of the time, we totes win the slang game, but calling them solicitors is just weird. The phrase "My solicitor is charging me to defend me against a charge of solicitation." is a perfectly valid thing to say in British English.

I admit I had to google what a biscuit was across the pond and had no idea you guys really dip pseudo-scones in gravy. I'd never heard of that before outside of movies and such, and I still have no idea how accurately those represent US culture. I was genuinely surprised to find Solo Cups weren't just a Hollywood thing to make props look more distinctive and visible on camera.

If it's any consolation, it happens to us in England too. As an example, we used to call the teenage/second-level of education 'Secondary Schools', but more and more schools are being termed 'high schools' now. It's cool. Give it a few hundred years and most cultures will have melded more closely together anyway. Change makes life interesting and all that, right? :)
