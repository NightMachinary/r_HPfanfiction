I like the flow of the words for rubbish bin over garage can, but normally I say trash/trash can. For the most part the students in my classroom take almost everything literally so I TRY to only use common language at work. I miss being a substitute. I got to work with all the students 6th grade through senior and still got to use sarcasm and joke more.
