  Confused:Must be a AU Trek universe, as the Galaxy class (Enterprise-D)was supposed to be the first ship class with saucer section separation.

In Star Trek Beyond separating the saucer is a plot point due to saucer trying to draw on power from the no longer connected engineering section.

  During the 23rd century, hull segment separations were dangerous, last-resort maneuvers, used in the event of a catastrophic emergency. (TOS: "The Apple")
