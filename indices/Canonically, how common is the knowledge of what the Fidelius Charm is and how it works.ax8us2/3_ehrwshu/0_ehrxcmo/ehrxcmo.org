People don't know about the Potters dying under it or about the secret keeper business. Fudge telling the story of Sirius being the traitor in PoA makes it /very clear/ that it's not something most people are aware of. Sirius was arrested for killing 13 people with a single curse, the Fidelius is never touched on elsewhere. People like Arthur know that Sirius was once close with James, so he betrayed them either way (even without knowing at all about the Fidelius) and are just trying to warn Harry from that angle.
