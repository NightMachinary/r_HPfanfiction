Arthur and Bill Weasley got two Fidelius Charms running within a few minutes in DH.

James Potter has to be the one who casted the Fidelius Charm by himself, because if it was done by Dumbledore, he would know who the Secret Keeper was. But unlike the Weasleys, the Potters couldn't become their own secret keeper.

Now the question became why Voldemort didn't use Fidelius Charms to hide his Horcruxes, with him as the Secret Keeper. But of course, if that had happened, the canon Horcrux Hunt would have never worked.

Fidelius Charm is IMHO another example of the Series's plot railroading and inconsistent world building.
