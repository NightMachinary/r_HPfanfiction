That doesn't explain why he 'trusted' Bellatrix and Lucius with his Horcruxes directly.

I still think explanations from [[/u/MTheLoud][u/MTheLoud]] and [[/u/Autumnsouls][u/Autumnsouls]] are the best:

1. Voldemort had to be the Secret Keeper, but his incomplete soul couldn't hide the secret.
2. Fidelius Charm only worked on the locations that were owned, and that would cut down on numbers of places he could hide.
