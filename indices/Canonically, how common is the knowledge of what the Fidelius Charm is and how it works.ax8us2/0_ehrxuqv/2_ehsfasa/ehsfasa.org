  Now the question became why Voldemort didn't use Fidelius Charms to hide his Horcruxes, with him as the Secret Keeper.

Presumably you have to be the owner of the Secret to cast the Fidelius Charm on it. Riddle wasn't the owner of any of the locations he placed his Horcruxes in. And possibly the Fidelius Charm before the time of the books hadn't been able to allow the owner of the Secret to be his or her own Secret Keeper.
