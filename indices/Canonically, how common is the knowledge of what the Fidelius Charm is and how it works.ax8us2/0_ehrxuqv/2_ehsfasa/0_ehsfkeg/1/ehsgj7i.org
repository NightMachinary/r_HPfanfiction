It may not be specified, but I feel the implication exists through the potential it has otherwise. If that's not the explanation, then you could place the spell on information about Horcruxes, the White House, other people's homes, all the toilets in Hogwarts, etc. I don't think a lack of explanation automatically makes something a plot hole or inconsistent.
