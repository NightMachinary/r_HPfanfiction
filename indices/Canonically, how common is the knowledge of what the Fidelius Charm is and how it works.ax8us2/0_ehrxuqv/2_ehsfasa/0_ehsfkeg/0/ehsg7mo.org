Also it's unclear to me what makes one 'own' a location. Do you have to place some structure or magic on the land? Voldemort did that to the cave. In a lot of ways it is his cave, no? Same argument for the Gaunt shack.

I think the better reason for Voldemort not using the Fidelius is him not wanting to trust anyone with the secret. Maybe he's even incapable of casting the spell (or being involved in the casting at all) because he's unable to trust in such a fundamental way.
