  I think the better reason for Voldemort not using the Fidelius is him not wanting to trust anyone with the secret. Maybe he's even incapable of casting the spell (or being involved in the casting at all) because he's unable to trust in such a fundamental way.

Oh yeah? Then how do you explain why he gave two of Horcruxes to Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange directly?

For him, is it safer to let these two cast the Fidelius on two locations, or give those two his precious items directly?
