The magic system in HP canon gives me a headache because on the one hand it is just so powerful but on the other is severely under-utilized by the average wizard.

For it to make sense I relate it to how easy it is to learn things like computer programming now-a-days and how it's not that much more expensive to build your own personalized computer from parts bought separately. Same goes for making your own clothing or building a solar panel. But realistically, how many people are taking advantage of those possibilities? Similarly, just because the opportunity to learn all this powerful magic is there, most people just don't want to put in the time/effort. So you end up with overachievers like Riddle and Dumbledore who get bored with regular school work and go looking for something more 'interesting'.

There is also room for natural ability - there are born legilimens (spelling?) and people who are better suited to learning occlumency (my head canon is that you need to tick some of the psychopathy boxes).
