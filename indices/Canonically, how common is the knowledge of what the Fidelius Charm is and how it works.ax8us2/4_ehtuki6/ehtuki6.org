I think this question would have a different answer before and after 1981. Cornelius Fudge, not exactly a magical expert, and relatively junior at the time, knows about the Fidelius in 1993 precisely because of the story of Lily and James using it to go into hiding. So I think that Voldemort's fall will have significantly increased the circulation of the spell (if not its performance, given that it is described as very complex).
