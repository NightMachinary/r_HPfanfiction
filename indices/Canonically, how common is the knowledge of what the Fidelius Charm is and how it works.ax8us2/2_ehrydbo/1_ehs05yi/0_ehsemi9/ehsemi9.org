This isnt quite right. Hardly any wizard can read minds, because it's difficult, taboo, weird and therefore obscure. Occlumency for the same reasons. Even knowing about it doesn't mean one can do it, as it also requires an uncommon level of maturity, emotional control and discipline (this is why Harry was no good at it). Children couldn't come to school knowing it, and anyone writing that is being incredibly silly. That's all not even mentioning the fact that learning Occlumency, besides the daily discipline it requires, also seems to required having ones mind attacked and violated repeatedly. No one who isn't crazy would put their kids through that, whether or not it was beneficial in extremely niche cases.
