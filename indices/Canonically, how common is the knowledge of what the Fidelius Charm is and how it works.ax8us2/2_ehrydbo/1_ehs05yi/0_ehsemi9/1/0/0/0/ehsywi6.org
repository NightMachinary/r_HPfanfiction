The problem is it's hard for most Legilimens to outright really someone's mind without explicitly casting the spell. All of 4 people in the entire series have shown to be able to perform the spell wandlessly and without detection, and each are regarded as nearly unparalleled masters. And even then, they required direct eye contact to remain undetected. You are vastly overstating the dangers, and besides which, Snape mentions there are spells that can protect ones mind so it's not like there's some tremendous danger that cannot be overcome with just a little forethought if you're really concerns about defending the mind.
