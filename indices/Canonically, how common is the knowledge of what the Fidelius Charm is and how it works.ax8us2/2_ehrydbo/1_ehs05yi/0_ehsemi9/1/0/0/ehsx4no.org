I don't think Legilimency is very rare skill. We see the Magical World from Harry's very limited view, and still we (he) get to know about 4 legiliments. How many of them he doesn't know about?

Mind reading is /very/ powerful skill. Imagine that you can read minds of your trading partners. Or your political opponents. Many people will pay a lot to learn it (including time).
