Violating someone's mind isn't "unpleasant". This isn't like learning to read or make new friends or some crucial life skills. As I said, Legilimency is an obscure and incredibly rare ability. It's not even remotely part of the life of even upper class wizards. Draco only learned it so Snape couldn't breeze into his mind, not because it's some plutocratic rite of passage or something.
