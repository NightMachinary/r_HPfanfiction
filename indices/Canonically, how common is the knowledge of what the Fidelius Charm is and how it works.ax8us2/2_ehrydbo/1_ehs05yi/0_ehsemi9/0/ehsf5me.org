And that's why Draco suddenly becoming good in occulmency in HBP is so inconsistent. The same is with patronus. In PoA it is shown as extremely uncommon for a wizard to produce corporal patronii, but in OOtP...bam! Almost every DA member produces corporal patronii within two sessions. Heck even inept witch like umbridge has a patronus.
