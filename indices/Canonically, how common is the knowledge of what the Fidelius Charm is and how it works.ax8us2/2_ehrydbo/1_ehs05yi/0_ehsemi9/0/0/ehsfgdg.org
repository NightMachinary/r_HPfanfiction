That's not true though. In OoTP, only 5 people in the DA manage corporeal Patronii: Seamus (briefly), Ron, Hermione, Cho and (I think) Luna; no one else. Draco is stated to have practiced Occlumency with Bellatrix during and after the summer after fifth year. I wouldn't overestimate his skill with it either. He was good enough to prevent Snape waltzing into his mind just by looking at his eyes. Even then, the reason why he could do it is somewhat clear. He wasn't as emotionally damaged as Harry was.

Also, we don't know if Umbrige was an inept witch, she was just cruel and sycophantic.
