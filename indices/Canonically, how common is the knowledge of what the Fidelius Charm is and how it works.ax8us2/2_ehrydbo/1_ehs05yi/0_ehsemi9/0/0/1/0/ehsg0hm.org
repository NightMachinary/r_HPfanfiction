Not necessarily. It depends on the values of the place one is at. Dumbledore says Fudge placed a high value on blood purity, as did Umbrige. That's why you have someone like Arthur, who was a strong, well regarded member of the community, not receive promotions despite good work (it's stated Arthur's love of all things Muggles (which is weird, mind you) stopped him from getting ahead). You don't always get ahead through sheer usefulness, nepotism and being an agreeable cog in the machine gets many people far, which seems to be why Umbrige even got a promotion once Voldemort took over. ðŸ˜£
