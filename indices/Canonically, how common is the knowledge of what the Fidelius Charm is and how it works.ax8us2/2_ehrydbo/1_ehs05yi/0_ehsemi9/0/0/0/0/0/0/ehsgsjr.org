I don't know if it did require precision. There's a difference between reading a mind carefully to find specific information and just breaking in period (the latter is likely what Bella did to Draco). She must have already learned it pre Azkaban, so more than likely it was second nature to her. It's not like she was in Azkaban long enough to lose her powers.
