I don't actually know if Bella could use Occlumency at that point. The way to learn Legilimency, if Snape's method is normal, only appears to require one to develop a resistance to the intrusions of Legilimens. And I can definitely see Bella still being deadly at breaking into people's minds. Even better at it after Azkaban, I'd bet.
