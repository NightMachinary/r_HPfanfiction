That's always been one of my pet peeves about HP fanfic. Since the Fidelius, the mind arts, etc. are all incredibly cool, very powerful, and plot-relevant, fanfic authors insert them every damn place and have everyone and their brother aware of the details. Every pureblood and their squib cousin seems to know what occlumency is, since no pureblood scion would /dare/ be sent off to Hogwarts without knowing how to protect their mind.

But things like that are supposed to be really obscure magic. Dumbledore and Snape are powerful and rare wizards for having mastered stuff like that.

If a fic has someone casually firing off a patronus messenger spell in the first paragraph just to order a pizza, that's an immediate drop for me.
