  In this case, [spoiler] seemed rather out of character, relative to how she is presented in the rest of the story. Similarly, why did Fleur think it a good idea to keep Hermione in the dark as to the meaning of the necklace for several chapters?

It's been a while since I read it, but iirc [[/spoiler][it came down to her insecurity and anxiety about "forcing" anything on Hermione even when Hermione was clearly reciprocating her feelings. I think there was also pent up resentment and distrust of her Veela side for putting them in that situation. Her issues had obviously created a self-destructive streak.]]

Personally, I liked how this fic avoided the confident, aloof, unrealistically 'perfect' characterization often used for Fleur, even if she turned the angst up to 11.

And thanks, good to hear that people are still enjoying it. :) Participation has declined somewhat.
