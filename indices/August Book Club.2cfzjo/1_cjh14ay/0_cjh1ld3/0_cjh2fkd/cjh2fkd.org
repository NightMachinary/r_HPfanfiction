I can see now how that explains it. One thing I found interesting as well was [[/spoiler][how calm Fleur was in the face of death from literal heartbreak]], though this might be a part of a mechanism to try and reign in her feelings after the [[/spoiler][Veela incident]]. Regarding the reduced participation, I think it might be beacuse Fleur/Hermione is an uncommon pairing and even though selecting fanfiction by its pairing is far from optimal, most of us do it anyway. Slash is a small subset, femslash even smaller, etc.
