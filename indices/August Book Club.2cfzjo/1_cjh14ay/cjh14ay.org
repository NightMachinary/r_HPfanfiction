I had never read this pairing before, and I quite enjoyed the story. However, here are some things that irritated me:

- This is not specific to this story as I have seen it many times before, but each time it causes me to lose a little bit of interest in the fic: The author, in order to underline the severity of the problems which the characters encounter, draws out the certain plot elements over long chapters, often causing the protagonists to repeat themselves and overall to seem stubborn and unwilling to resolve a conflict. In this case, [[/spoiler][Fleur's continued taking of the Nun's Potion, despite its obvious physical side-effects and her own qualms about it creating distance between Hermione and herself]] seemed rather out of character, relative to how she is presented in the rest of the story. Similarly, why did Fleur think it a good idea to keep Hermione in the dark as to the meaning of the necklace for several chapters? It is certainly hard to imagine canon Hermione accepting this sort of recitence.

- Another peeve was that the author made no remark as to the Second War or the struggle against You-Know-Who right up until the last few paragraphs of the last chapter, in which we learn that /"The war, despite their wishing, loomed above them all"/ , and Hermione must depart to help Harry and Ron in their quest after all. Not at any point beforehand was the subject of the War broached, nor was Hermione's involvement in a wartime Golden Trio. Bit of a nasty surprise there, as it leaves the whole relationship in a very precarious spot.

Now, here are some things I found particularly well-written and generally interesting:

- The author manages to convey a certain quiet "foreignness" to the French characters' speech which was far more enjoyable to read than JKR's horrendous Fleur-speech.

- The use of some one-word sentences ('Forward.') at certain points in the story felt forced at first, but it quickly blended in to the text, and their use becomes more sparing and thus significant later on.

Romance is often hard to pace, and fanfiction authors don't always manage to give their story an even flow, but outside of the complaint I raised above, the pacing in this story was remarkably good. The main characters do not overpower one another, as they both take the lead at different times in the story. Despite how much bad I have said about the plot, I spent an entire day reading this fic non-stop, which should say something as to how captivating the author can be. Overall, an enjoyable first F/Hr fic which made me interested in the pairing.

Thank you for the suggestion [[/u/denarii]], I have really enjoyed the last couple of Book Clubs. Keep it up!
