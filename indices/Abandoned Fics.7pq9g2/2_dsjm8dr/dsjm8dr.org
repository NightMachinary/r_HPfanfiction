Well, the fics I really loved to read and want to see finished are good because of the person who wrote them, their writing style, their humour, their characterisations, their foreshadowing. I want to see how they imagined the story would continue. So while there are a lot of stories I want to see finished (most of all On the Way to Greatness, but also Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived) I can't imagine I would get much satisfaction reading someone else's continuation. Are there any examples out there where someone took over a story and actually continued to write it at the same level of quality? (And didn't get bored after a couple of chapters?)
