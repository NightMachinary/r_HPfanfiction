The plot wasn't anything to write home about and it had its share of awkward scenes, but after awhile it just became a rather fluffy if unrealistic story about how many inventions and new enterprises you could stuff into the setting.

It was like one big checklist of things that would later become cliches. I keep coming back to enjoy the sheer breadth of ideas. And damn if it isn't one of my guilty pleasures.
