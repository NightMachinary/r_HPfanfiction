- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2428341/1/Mastermind-Hunting][/Mastermind Hunting/]] --- A lot happens in this story before Harry's first year even starts --- and this is also one of the stories that can be recommended in the “world-travelling Harry” request threads. Overall, I'd say it's a pretty decent read, even if it does have its bad moments. Among the problems with this story are some goofy plot arcs and plot devices; Harry being too OP (please nerf); Voldemort, Dumbledore and Snape being underpowered (both intellectually and magically); the ending being a sudden clusterfuck out of nowhere; etc.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4573620/1/A-Drop-of-Poison][/A Drop of Poison/]] --- this one's a Naruto fanfic, if that's also your kinda thing. When Naruto's made to fail the genin exams yet again and has to spend yet another year in the academy, he decides to enter as three separate people at the same time. He clues Iruka-sensei in, explains it as a controlled experiment that will show how capable he actually is, and how much do the teachers actually work against him to make him fail year after yaer. Among the drawbacks is a broken magical system that can make anyone above a certain +mana+ chakra threshold way too OP (IIRC).
