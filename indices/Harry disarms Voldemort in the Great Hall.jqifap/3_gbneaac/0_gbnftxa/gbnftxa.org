Harry is shown to be reasonably good at duelling. He is quick on his feet and while with limited arsenal - he can take on Death Eaters. Wandless powers are a thing, but nowhere close to Wand Magic. So I don't think it means Harry has lost. Doesn't mean Voldemort can't have a trick up his sleeve (say his original wand hidden in his robes or smth)
