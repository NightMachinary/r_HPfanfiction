It's hard to say... As you said, Harry is pretty good at dueling but I think Voldemort's wandless magic can still at least match him, if not surpass him even with the Elder Wand (he is considered the most powerful Dark Lord of the century after all).

He could have his original wand as well but that seems unlikely considering his personality and a probable fear that his wand may refuse to attack Harry since according to Dumbledore, the twin wands recognized each others' owners after the duel in the graveyard.

However, it might also be that Harry is from now on immune to Voldemort due to the sacrifice. Not sure if it applies to him too or only to the rest of the people.
