Snape/Anyone for any reason but especially Harry: even ignoring the age gap and generally shitty and abusive treatment that Snape gives Harry at every opportunity, he has creepy obsessions with both of his parents that colour every interaction the two every have. What even is the appeal? As for literally everyone else, he's a terrible person and any romantic partner would suffer for it.

Harry or Hermione (or really any of the protagonists, but those are the who get shipped the most, so here we are) with any blood purist: I shouldn't have to explain this. That shipping a character who believes that people with muggle ancestry are subhuman with people with muggle ancestry (or someone without it but who knows better) is stupid and incredibly fucked up should be self-evident. That hasn't stopped me from running into multiple 100K+ Hermione/Bellatrix stories.

Hermione/Malfoy: this gets a special mention because he's actively wished death on her because of her blood status since he was twelve. Maybe he became less of a scumbag in his adult years, but Hermione has no reason to give him the time of day.

Harry/Malfoy: again, special mention despite having broadly covered it already, this time because it's so bloody ubiquitous. Malfoy is a horrible person, and while Harry did some questionable shit over the course of the series, he's a fundamentally decent human being. The two are not compatible.

Harry/Hermione: I don't enjoy it and I don't see the appeal. I don't begrudge anyone for liking it, but I personally do not.

Harry/Ron: admittedly, this is a bit of a guilty pleasure. I prefer them as friends, but their dynamic is fun and the relationship being romantic doesn't detract from that, so I can live with it.

Harry/a version of Ginny who hasn't grown out of her crush: gross. Also tedious. Develop your characters, please.

Harry/old-snakeman Voldemort: gross. Gross on every conceivable level. And on some levels of which humanity can't conceive.

Harry/young, sexy Voldemort: honestly somehow even worse. With these you tend to get authors who seem to genuinely believe that it's a healthy relationship. If Harry and Riddle are in character, it's not. If they aren't, there's no point.

I believe I have exhausted my vitriol. Didn't know I had a finite amount, actually.
