Pedoships (Snape-Remus-Sirius/Hermione), and ships with people with completely different ideologies. Why would Hermione be with a DE? She wouldn't, you would need to make her completely OOC, and at that point you're better off making an OC instead of a HINO.

On the orientation side there are some characters that are too straight to make gay and vice versa, but I don't really hate those, I just think it's poor writing to use them outside of smut stories.
