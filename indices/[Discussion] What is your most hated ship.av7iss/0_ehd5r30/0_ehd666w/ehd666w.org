Yeah, I don't like those either and is a big reason why I dislike slash in particular.

Hermione is one of those characters that I can't really think of a ship for her that I like. Harmony is my main ship with HP, as tainted as it is by all the bashing fics that utilize it, but beyond that I just don't like a lot of them.

She's hard to ship outside of crossovers where you have a character that would go with her well in my opinion, Dramione, Romione, Pedo ships, none of them really ring true to me.

I do remember reading a decent Neville x Hermione fic once, but damn if I can't remember the name.
