What a riveting discussion that gives this sub a welcoming,neutral,and not all circlejerking atmosphere.In all seriousness Snarry horrifies me and the fact that there are people who defend Harry/Bella here disgusts me as well.This sub's general attitude towards Drarry and stuff is understandable(these pairings disgust me too),but non stop one sided discussions get old and add jack shit.There's also the bashing of slash(f/f is apparently ok even the most is probably badly written hawt leasbian sex)to the point where /hundreds of people felt they needed a space to talk about slash without judgment/ I've only been here since November and this sub's general attitude has gotten incredibly grating.
