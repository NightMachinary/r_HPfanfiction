100% agree with this, I started out with a het pairing and after reading all the good ones, I had a hard time trying to read new ones that seemed reasonably decent, so I stumbled on a slash pairing and suddenly had a whole new slew of great fics to read, sure I came across a few crappy ones and figured out what my threshold was, but any pairing can have fics that can be good or bad regardless of what the pairing actually is
