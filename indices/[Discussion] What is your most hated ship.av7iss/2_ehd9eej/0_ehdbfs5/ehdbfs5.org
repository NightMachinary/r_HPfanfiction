Basically every slash fic is exactly like I described in my post in my experience. I have tried /so very hard/ to like slash, but unless the relationship is actually canon, they suffer the pitfalls I described because canon didnt do the heavy lifting for them.

As for talking about slash without judgement, I'm a proponent of "if your ship, fic, or idea sucks, I'm gonna tell you." I cant help it, I dont judge you for liking it, I like Femslash, I'm a hypocrite, but I will gladly tell you what is wrong with your fic/ship/idea, granted I try to do it in a constructive fashion.
