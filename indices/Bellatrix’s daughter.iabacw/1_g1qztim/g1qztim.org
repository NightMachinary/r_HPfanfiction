I've read a few of these, but probably not as many as some others. With that being said, by far the best one that I have read is linkffn(Harry Potter and the ashes of chaos) It's a WIP but updates every weekend. The author seems to post 8-12k word chapters without fail at this point in the story, and it is very well done overall, if a bit heavy on tropes. In saying that, he does a lot of unique stuff with said tropes. Probably my favourite ongoing story at the moment.
