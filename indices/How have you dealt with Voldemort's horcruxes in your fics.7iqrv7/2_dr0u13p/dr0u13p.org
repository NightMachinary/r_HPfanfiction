I'm nowhere near the Horcrux hunt in my main story, but I'll be changing everything but what the Horcruxes are (cup, locket, etc.).

I'll be moving them though. Well, not the diary since my story starts in fourth year. I also can't figure out any real reason to change the ring's location, so that's probably staying.

The cup will be taken out of the vault and moved.

The locket will not go to Umbridge, but will be sold to someone in Knockturn Alley, where it gets sold again, and so on. My fem!Harry will have a hell of a time tracking it down.

The diadem will be taken out of the RoR and go fuck knows where.

Nagini will get thrown into the sun. No, not really. Maybe. It's classified.

I'll probably have Voldemort make another out of desperation.

I'm also making them more similar to the movie version rather than the book version in terms of how sinister and evil they can appear and work. I like the idea of them being so dark that the Dark Magic begins physically manifesting itself. For example:

  She stared into the darkness of the Chamber of Secrets, silently trying to fool herself into believing she wasn't frightened. Even with her wand lit, she could hardly see a few feet in front of her. It was as though the Chamber liked the dark, didn't want anyone to disturb it even, and was waiting until she was just far enough into the Chamber to shut the door and shut out all light, even from her wand, leaving her in total darkness.

  She imagined a shadowy hand reaching out from the darkness and using its long, withered, rotting fingers to extinguish the tip of her wand. The thought of it sent a strong coldness up her spine. She knew there was a basilisk here, and for some odd reason, despite knowing it could kill her in less than a second, it wasn't as scary --- or perhaps scary wasn't the correct word.

  Unsettling, and unnatural. The thought of the basilisk wasn't causing her to feel unnerved, as though something unsettling, unnatural, and depraved was lurking in the dark. She could almost feel the evil in the air, and as she took step after step, ignoring the eyes of the stone snakes she was sure were following her every move, the oppressive feeling of something sinister grew.

  The light on the tip of her wand did not waver, however, nor did it vanish. It remained steady, and though it seemed as though the light was reluctant in spreading, Iris pushed forward, determined to find Ginny.

The diary Horcrux is corrupting the Chamber of Secrets with its influence. I plan on having the other Horcruxes work similarly. They're such twisted and evil works of magic --- utter abominations --- that they have the power to turn something innocent into the most vile. Like Dol Guldur in LotR. The place should be a beautiful forest, if my memory is correct, but the corruption of Sauron causes it to turn into the evil that it eventually becomes before Galadriel obliterates it.
