I did the same with the Locket in linkffn(A World Unseen: Vol II) The Locket fed on the dark magic of ever other cursed object in the drawing room, allowing it to take a semi-physical form. When it is encountered, The adults all hit it with their Patroni, which weakens it, before Harry goes all Gimli on the Horcrux with a sword he retrieved from the Chamber of Secrets.

As for the other Horcruxes:

Dumbledore bled the Diary for information until he knew everything the Diary had known before using Greek Fire to destroy it.

The Ring will be dealt with before the Quidditch World Cup, as it is instrumental that Harry have the Hallows by then. (Master of Death is a misnomer, but the Hallows are very important in context.)

The Cup... well, Gringotts will have another break in by a dark wizard.

The Diadem will be lost to sheer, dumb luck (or horrible luck depending on how you look at it.)

Nagini will fall victim to an Inigo Montoya.

And Harry's Scarcrux has the metaphysical consistency of spent charcoal at the moment, and there is only enough room in his head for two souls, so somebody has to go.
