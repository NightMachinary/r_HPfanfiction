Okay so some general thoughts on the horcruxes. First they should probably you treated like the one ring from Lord of the Rings so the longer someone is in contact with an active horcrux the more corrosive effect on them it has. Second these horcruxes should have plenty of very lethal defenses Voldemort is not stupid and in Canon leaves plenty of nasty tricks and traps to protect them. Three for me the coolest horcruxes in Canon to me were slytherins locket and Tom Riddle's Diary that is because the gang had to actively confront an aspect of Voldemort this could be especially useful if you want to have a dark Harry plot line where Harry starts embracing more and more dark magic you can then extrapolate that it's a result of him being exposed to Voldemort more and more often combined with his own horcrux in his scar.
