My story has a single point of departure, so the Horcruxes at the beginning are the same ones that existed in 1991 (although Nagini isn't one yet and probably won't ever be with how badly I've twisted around the canon timeline at this point). However, Harry, Hermione, Ron and Co. aren't trying to destroy the Horcruxes, just to round them up, since they have already subdued Voldemort. As of now they've got a Petrified Voldemort and the Diary safely locked away. Dumbledore is aware that Voldemort has been captured but not that any of his Horcruxes have been found. Only time will tell what happens for the other ones.
