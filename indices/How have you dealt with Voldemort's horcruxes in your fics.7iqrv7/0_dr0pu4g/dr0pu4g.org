In various ways, since I aim not to repeat my plots:

Canon locations - gathered and dealt with similar to canon, though more quickly since Harry's protection was still active against all curses cast by Voldemort before his resurrection in the graveyard.

In a crossover with Buffy, a ritual was used to mend Voldemort's soul which destroyed the Horcruxes (and greatly enhanced Voldemort's power as an unintended result) without having to track them.

Use of a ritual to shred Voldemort's soul using one of his (non-canon) Horcruxes as a link since it was impossible to find and destroy all of them.

Tracking his (non-canon) Horcruxes through Harry's scar and destroying them with Fiendfyre.

Bypassing the (non-canon and spread across the world) Horcruxes by destroying Voldemort's consciousness in a mental battle.

Emprisoning his soul in a crystal until his last non-canon Horcrux (literally) resurfaced, then destroy said Horcrux and release the soul.
