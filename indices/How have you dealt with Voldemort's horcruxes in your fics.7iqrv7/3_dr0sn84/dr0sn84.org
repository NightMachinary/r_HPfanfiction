I only have five in my outline at the moment. The locket, cup, diadem, diary, and ring.

The ring is the only one that I have a clear idea for. As it was made when Voldemort was at school, it would be like him during that time: enchanting and charming. And instead of a curse activating when the ring is worn, it is a enchantment that activates when the box is opened.\

That's all I got for now.
