The Gryffindor sword was key in getting Bella to spill the beans on the cup's location because she thought it was in her vault, and that if it was out, then other things (like the cup) might have been stolen as well. No sword, nobody knows where to look for the cup.

And in my particular mild AU, the slightly different mix of mental disorders in Voldy's head made his death eaters slightly more tolerable by the masses and slightly better at infiltrating the ministry and Gringotts and implementing their laws/policies. Getting Nevil compensation would be even more unlikely than in canon.
