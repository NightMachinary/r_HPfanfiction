I prefer to ignore the ones in Harry and Nagini since they are 1/64th or less of a soul. You can't anchor an aircraft carrier with a shoelace and I doubt that such a small part of the soul would work. After halloween Riddle still had most of his soul around. Only the destruction of the ring, diary, diadem and the cup made him mortal, he still had to be killed though.

Alternatively Harry has the scar surgically removed, taking the Horcrux out without ever knowing what it was.
