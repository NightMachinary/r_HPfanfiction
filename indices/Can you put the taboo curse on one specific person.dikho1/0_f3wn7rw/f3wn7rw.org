It's not clear if the Taboo is something Voldemort did or the Ministry did once it was under Voldemort's control. There are two main reasons to think it's the Ministry:

1. Voldemort doesn't do it until he takes the Ministry, which implies that before then he /couldn't/.

2. When Harry, Ron and Hermione activate the taboo in DH, the Snatchers who come to get them are talking about taking them back to the Ministry, implying that's where taboo operations are normally operated from. They only divert to Malfoy Manor once they suspect that they've caught Harry Potter.
