I have no idea where they came up with those values, but they make no sense. If you go with Rowling's estimate that 1 galleon is roughly equivalent to Â£5 (and assuming that was in 1991, since she didn't specify), 1 galleon would be somewhere around 15 US dollars in 2016.

Of course, if galleons are actually solid gold, her estimate is utterly ridiculous.
