If I remember correctly, the only good frame of reference we have for money in the wizarding world is how much Harry has to pay for a copy of the Daily Prophet while he's traveling with Hagrid all of the way back in the first book.

If you assume the cost of the Daily Prophet was roughly equal to the cost of the average British paper at the time, you get about 1 galleon to 95 pounds. Round up to 100 pounds for convenience sake.

This actually makes a lot of sense because it means that wands cost around 700-1000 pounds, not 35-50 pounds. It's easy to understand why the Weasleys can't afford a bunch of them under the higher price, but not so much with the lower price.
