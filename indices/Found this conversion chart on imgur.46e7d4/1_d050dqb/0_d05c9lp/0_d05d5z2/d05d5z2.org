I didn't say it was "simple," just that it's the only reliable frame of reference we have - it's the one and only time that a price is mentioned of something that exists in both worlds. It is thus the only basis on which any sort of currency exchange rate can be estimated.

The fact that it results in prices for other things making sense supports its use.

Finally, we haven't the foggiest idea what the "cost of living" for magicals might be, so we have no idea how "vastly different" it might be from muggles. There's nothing in canon about average salaries, the cost of food, the cost of housing, or anything else.

We know that the Weasleys are poor, poor enough that they can't even afford new wands for at least their youngest, and I believe also their older children (I think Charlie had Ron's first wand before him). Since the wand is the absolutely most important tool any witch of wizard can have, not being able to afford a well-matched wand is seriously bad poverty.

They really don't seem to be so poor that they can't afford the equivalent of 50 pounds, but definitely poor enough that 700-1000 pounds is out of their range.

JKR was bad with math, she admitted it herself. Her "official" currency exchange rate doesn't make much sense and neither does her "official" estimate of the magical population of Britain. Better to use well-reasoned and logical alternatives.
