[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1237073][Severus Snape and the Boy Who Lived]] is an absolutely fantastic series. The whole premise is that Snape is actually a strict, competent professor instead of an abusive incel. It's a blend of epistolary, lectures, and conversations instead of a strict story format.
