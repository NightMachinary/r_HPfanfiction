I don't know how to link to stories, but "In the Name of the Brave" on AO3 by Lullabyknell is one of the best portrayals I've read of Hogwarts functioning as an actual school, and features an expanded staff, and more competence.

It appears to be abandoned though, which is a crying shame as it's shaping up to be a fantastic story.
