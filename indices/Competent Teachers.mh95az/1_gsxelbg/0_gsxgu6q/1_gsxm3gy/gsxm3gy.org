I would /love/ for LullabyKnell to return to this fic. It is one that I would quite happily disregard all of canon for, it's that good.

I'm a sucker for a re-write anyway, but one of that quality is so rare. I'm still learning how AO3 works so need to figure out how to set myself an alarm in case of updates (back in the day when I first started fanfiction, there was just FFN and the Restricted Section (for all your NSFW needs - don't know if that even exists anymore).

I am also still quite new to Reddit so thanks for doing the link!
