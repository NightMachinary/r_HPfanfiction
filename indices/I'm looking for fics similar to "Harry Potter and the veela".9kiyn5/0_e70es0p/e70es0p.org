*Are you looking for WBWL or Harry x Fleur?*

​

*For WBWL:*

Linkffn(Antithesis) is one of my favorites. Very well written.

Linkffn(Prince of Slytherin) is a classic in this category

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy who Lived) I think this is the one where he goes to Durmstrang. Gets mildly AU

Linkffn(You get what you give) if you don't mind Fem!Harry

​

*For Harry x Fleur:*

Linkffn(A Cadmean Victory)

I don't read Harry x Fleur but I forgot to look at the tags on this one before reading it so I know about it lol. I don't know any others.
