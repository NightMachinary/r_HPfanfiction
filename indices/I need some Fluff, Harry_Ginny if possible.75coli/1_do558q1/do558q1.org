If you're interested in Harry and Ginny, they are mainly what I write. I started writing fan fiction before OOTP came out when the ultimate fates of the characters wasn't yet known and it wasn't a sure thing that Harry and Ginny would end up together.

Anyway, I have a whole raft of stories that sort of traces the arc of their relationship in my Potterverse, mainly one-shots but there are few multi-chapters including at 39-chapter monster over at AO3. Be advised, I write them as adults doing adult things so if "smug" was a typo for "smut", then you should be all right.
