I loved how in this book Hogwarts starts when they are 16:

  By the by, you may be wondering why I received this letter on my /sixteenth/ birthday and not my /eleventh/, as in my novels. The answer is quite simple: not even the wizarding community, a community so asinine that they elected Cornelius Fudge as Minister for Magic, would be so stupid as to give pubescent children magic wands. Combining teenage hormones with the power to unravel the very fabric of the cosmos scarcely bears thinking about. Besides that obvious drawback, wizarding children need a basic education just like Muggle children: it's no use having the power to brew a magic potion if you don't have the maths to follow the recipe. So students at Hogwarts College begin at sixteen. I reduced it to eleven because I was writing for the children's market (much more lucrative) and you have to give the little tykes a hero they can identify with; hence, my fictional self starting magic school at eleven.

Hilarious rec, only wish it went on longer.
