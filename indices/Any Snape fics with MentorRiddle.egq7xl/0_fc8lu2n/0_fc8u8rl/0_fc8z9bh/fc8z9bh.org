So, Voldemort after resurrection somehow regains his sanity as the diary had been destroyed. Then he makes Snape brew a potion to help him gain a proper body. After this, he manages to get cleared by the wizengamot using the old laws, gains guardianship over Harry and regains Snape's loyalty. The remainder is about how he manages to further his agenda politically and also about how he comes to terms with his new found morality and attachment to Harry.
