I think many things are regional - being from the west country, I swear we see so much older slang than the rest of England. Bloody, bugger, using a curse word every other word, are in frequent use in certain areas here though they're hardly universal. Northern Ireland, particularly where I grew up, everyone swore every other word and said shite and other random slang that probably doesn't look real at all. It's just a matter of perspective.

Personally, I only get jarred if everyone sounds the same or someone from Camden sounds like someone from Birmingham.
