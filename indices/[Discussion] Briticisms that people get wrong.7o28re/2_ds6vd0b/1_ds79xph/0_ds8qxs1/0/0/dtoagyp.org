Majorca had a reputation (particularly during the 90s) for being somewhere trashy English people went on holiday to, thanks to budget airlines. Google Magaluf to see what I mean. Similarly some parts of Spain, some of the Greek islands like Zante and Kos, etc. Some Med islands are considered luxurious, like Sardinia.
