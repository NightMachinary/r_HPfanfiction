Well yes, that's exactly it - they're trying so hard that their (relative) wealth, Vernon's job title, and sending Dudley to private school doesn't make up for all their other signals of being quite common. The smarminess, the bragging loudly about the company car, the fact that their son is staying out late hanging around parks and beating kids up (and we can assume drinking and smoking), the fact that they think the height of a luxury holiday is Majorca...

They want to be middle class and probably consider themselves as such. But I imagine the parents of Dudley's classmates at the private school probably consider them dreadfully common.
