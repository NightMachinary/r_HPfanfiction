I think there's a real misunderstanding of the British class system and how much it impacts day to day life. Much of the 'Lord Potter', type stuff is a symptom of that. I feel like Americans feel that they need to take it to such an extreme because they view it as Downton vs normal people, but actually it's way more complex than that. It's heavily associated not just with wealth, but accent, education, occupation of yourself and of your parents, your hobbies, the clothes you wear, where you live down to specific streets... Even people that are wealthy may not be regarded as upper class, and there are more levels than simply working class, middle class and upper class. There are nuances to it that I can't explain.

It's a running theme in the books, but plenty of writers miss it entirely, so you get odd moments in fics that don't quite gel. It's easy to see that Justin is upper class, as he was down to go to Eton, but it's not so easy to see that the Dursley's are aspiring middle class at the most.

This sort of thing will affect the way characters behave. Middle/upper class characters won't be using as much slang, but when they do, it will be a certain type of slang. Working class characters are more likely to have a stronger accent. They may even feel intimidated in places like Hogwarts initially - they might try and hide their background, but it's more likely that they will defensively play up their working class roots. The way working class kids and middle class kids nickname each other is different. The way they act out and misbehave is different. The way they talk to authority figures is different.
