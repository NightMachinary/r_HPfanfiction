Absolutely, I mean I always find it jarring when you find fanfics that just describe everything as being velvet, marble or silk, because that's what rich people have I guess. Then there's the people that just use synonyms for words in an attempt to make their characters sound more 'refined' and it always just comes out so awkward and clunky and unnatural.

Most of the time you see none of the impact a character's upbringing has on them and any introduction to 'upper-class society' is just flawless after you flip through a thesaurus and get yourself some new robes
