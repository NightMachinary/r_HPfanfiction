For example, a girl I know went to my last school just for sixth form after having been at state schools for the rest of her life. The differences were cery clear in the way she thought about things (such as terms like mufti, about politics, about authority figures, etc), the way she spoke (her accent was far less refined, she generally use a narrower and more corse vocabulary, and so on. Indeed, I founs it difficult to understand her at times because it was so different to what I was used to hearing). Then there are things like the houses tou live in, the state schoolers usually (though by no means always) lived in smaller houses in less well off areas to my my more middle and upper class school chums. One big thing was how a lot of us referred to years as forms while they would jse the years. Persoanlly, I used both sometimes because many of my school (out of eight) were international schools outside of the uk. There are other things as well.
