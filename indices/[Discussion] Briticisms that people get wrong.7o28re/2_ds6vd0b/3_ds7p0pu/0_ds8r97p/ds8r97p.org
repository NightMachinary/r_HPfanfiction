On the contrary, I think class comes into play a lot in the wizarding world. The Malfoys and the Weasleys are both pure bloods, but the Weasley's are looked down upon. You might regard that as connected to their 'muggle loving', but that is the same as the way middle class people might look down on their friends if they hung out with people that lived on a council estate. The fact that the Malfoys relentlessly mock the Weasleys regarding the wealth, and the fact that Malfoy seems to view Remus Lupin and Hagrid with the same disdain, points to Rowling making class prejudice a strong theme in her book, which would make sense considering her background.

We can't say anything about Seamus's background, but his mother was clearly able to afford world cup tickets, by the 90s there was not as much prejudice against the Irish as people tend to think.
