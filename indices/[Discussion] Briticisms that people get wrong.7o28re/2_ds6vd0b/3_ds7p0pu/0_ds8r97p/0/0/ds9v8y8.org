Muriel is on the Prewett side, not the Weasley side. I completely agree you can be upper class and poor (as was my point earlier), but wealth is a large part of it and the Weasleys don't show any other signifiers of being upper class - they don't have a grand home, they have many children, the points you made about Arthur's job - they're all about class. Calling it a piss poor example is pretty rude, just because you disagree, when JK Rowling feels very strongly about class and makes it a theme throughout her writing.

Malfoy didn't know Lupin wasn't fully human. All the things you mention about blood are just allegories for class, which tends to be a stronger issue of prejudice in the UK than race, but is undoubtedly mixed. I think on this matter we will have to agree to disagree.
