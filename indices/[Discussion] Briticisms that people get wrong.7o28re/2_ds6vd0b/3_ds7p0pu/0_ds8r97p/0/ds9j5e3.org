But were aware that in previous generations the Weasleys did have wealth (Ron's great aunt owns a goblin tiara - passed down clearly, but still indicative of wealth) and considering how large of a family they are continuously mentioned to be, I always assumed that the Weasley “fortune” was just stretched too thin and never made a difference from generation to generation- your parents dies you might get £40 after a few large generations. And clearly Weasleys were good enough to marry off to some high falluten families in certain lines - in some Rowling drawn family tree I think a Weasley married a Black or something of the sort. And you can mostly certainly be upper-class and poor (in a way look at the Gaunts, squandered their fortune, into dark arts, heavy inbreeding, but they're descendants of Slytherin himself - by all means they'd be considered wizarding “royalty” in a fair world). And I think Arthur is seen some what as a joke in his job - he's obsessed with muggles beyond simply sympathising. And perhaps this is harsh, but I wouldn't be surprised if Arthur could've had a better paying job had he not been so in love with what he did for a living and making his family more comfortable by working in a different field. Lucius and Arthur clearly have some issues with each other that don't boil down to class. I think the Weasley/Malfoy examples are piss poor if you think about it, because they hate each other personally more than anything. But we don't know enough about other feuds/family relations in the wizarding world. The Malfoys look down on Hagrid and Lupin not because of their wealth (though they mock them for it) but because they aren't fully human or shown as being 1. Buyable by Lucius like Fudge and 2. Don't conform to standard wizarding dress codes/standards. I don't see it as class prejudice, I see it as blood and prejudice against “lesser beings.” Malfoy probably sees Lupin and Hagrid on the same plane as Dobby, perhaps lower, because they can't be controlled. When I mentioned Seamus being from Ireland I wasn't meaning it as an Irish-English clash, more as a person that we know where they're from. I can't remember mention of where Neville or Dean are from in the series... and so was trying to find an example of someone who didn't have any obvious tensions with Malfoy (aside from being a Gryffindor) and was from a rather middling background (not super wealthy, not super poor).
