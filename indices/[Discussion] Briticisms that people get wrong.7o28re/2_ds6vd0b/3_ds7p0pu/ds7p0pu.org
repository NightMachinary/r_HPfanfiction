Well I wouldn't be surprised if this was the case with muggleborns, etc. Class doesn't really seem to come into play in the wizarding world like blood does (or at least this is the substitute for class). The Malfoys are “posh” and upper class more than anything because of their pure blood status and wealth. The Weasleys are seen as “blood traitors” because they are poor and sympathetic to muggles/muggleborns- not because of where they are from. What wouldn't surprise me is if half-bloods in Slytherin downplayed that they weren't pureblooded in the same way someone from a working class background (or say the north) would hypothetically downplay their accent in an Eton like environment. Seamus is an example of someone who is from Ireland, doesn't seem particularly well-off (this is never alluded to if I recall), a half-blood but nonetheless he doesn't hide who he is and Malfoy never seems to take issue with him (as far as we know). So unless you're muggleborn or a blood traitor or a pure blood from a distinguished family (we know there's the sacred 28) there's not much class “tensions” as there is family feuds or views on muggles.
