Well people do say mom in the U.K... it's just unlikely that a canon character in HP would use it. No one from the middle class would say mom- and I can't think of many characters that would refer to their mother as anything other than mum (i.e. most of the children are at least middle class). Also mummy is much more common for a much older British (English, lets be real) person to say. Whereas I'm pretty positive you'd be shamed in the states for saying mommy above the age of 6 (it was hard not to shudder every time my ex called his mother mummy),
