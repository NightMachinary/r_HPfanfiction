Usually, Americanisms is a much bigger problem in the HP fandom than misused Britishisms... at least the misused Britishisms show that the author is trying, even if they don't succeed.

At the VERY least have the characters say "Mum," or alternately "Mam," if they're from North East or similar... but not /"Mom."/ It's not that hard to remember.
