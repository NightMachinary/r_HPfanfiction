The wrong use of nuts or nutters. Saying to an individual 'you are nutters'. No. A single person is nuts or is a nut, a group of people are nutters. You can say 'you are all nuts' in the plural, but a singular person can never be 'a nutters'.

Also, cream in your tea. I have never known a person to put cream in their tea. Perhaps it's geographical or just me? But I often think the writers have got the wrong end of the stick about what a 'cream tea' consists of.
