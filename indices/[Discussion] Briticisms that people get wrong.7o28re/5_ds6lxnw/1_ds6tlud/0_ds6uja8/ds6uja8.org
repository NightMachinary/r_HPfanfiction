Ah! Well that would account for it. In all my years of tea making and drinking no one has ever asked 'do you want cream with that' but I'm not an expert and maybe somewhere in the UK people do that? Just not anywhere I've ever been or anyone I've ever met! It's optional milk and/or sugar where I'm from. When they write the Malfoys or Dumbledore putting cream in their tea I am jarred out of the story.
