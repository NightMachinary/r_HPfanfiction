Most of the stuff that gets on my nerves is when people pick up those idiotic lists of "British" words and then just shove them in wherever it seems right. Like, there's a lot of variation in "British" accents, and you have to consider you have people from all over going to Hogwarts - Hagrid's from the West Country, Harry's from Surrey, the Weasleys are from Devon, and then you have people from other /countries/, like Seamus, where a lot more than just accent is different, even though he's an English speaker.

Molly Weasley isn't going to be using miner's slang from Swansea. Harry isn't going to be talking like a Cockney. And the Malfoys probably aren't going to use slang of /any/ kind.

The only character I'm a little more forgiving over is Severus Snape, 'cause I know people do occasionally try to show he's from the North, but based on the way Snape speaks, it's very likely he trained himself out of his accent, and would avoid any slang or word usage that would betray him. Occasionally, it's great to see when someone has stuff from his POV, though, where inside his own head, you see the sort of language he uses.
