OK, that's another thing that bugs me. They're shops, not stores :-)

Opening hours for shops and cinemas varied widely, just like they do today. 24 hour opening would be rare even in city centres, but 6am to midnight would be expected for a few small shops in any significant built-up area. Typical cinemas would have the first showing at around 9am for large modern cinemas, or mid-afternoon for the awful local flea-pit, and the last would be unlikely to start after 10pm. Pub opening hours were 11 to 11, or 12 to 10 on Sundays and public holidays for no particular reason. A few specific pubs near wholesale markets opened earlier all the time, and very occasional variations for opening earlier or later were allowed for special events.

This 'ere young adult (well, I was back then) left the pub at closing time and went home. Some of my various flatmates had no taste and so enjoyed nightclubs, which had late booze licences under the pretence of being private clubs.
