  Do they still ring a bell and call 'last orders'?

Yes. Or at least, very often. Some pubs will just start cleaning up and hope you take the hint and piss off but those are usually best avoided. Pub closing times vary from place to place and day by day but 11pm is pretty standard. Most places stay open longer on Fridays and Saturdays.
