This is only my personal experience and someone with a better memory will correct me on details I'm sure, but to the best of my recollection:

I was with a heavy party crowd between those ages so what we did may not be average, I really couldn't say, but my friends went to gigs, pubs, fairs, clubs, parties, raves. I'm pretty sure raves were fairly common? We had wood parties where we'd light a bonfire and party out in the woods hidden somewhere. Some nice weather days we went to beauty spots and wandered around or sat in open spaces, free spaces or parks, drinking and smoking and socialising. None of us had mobile phones so it was word of mouth to find out where everyone was hanging that day. You might take a while to track everyone down.

We'd hang at someone's house all night, watching videos and playing on games systems. You could hire video games and CDs from the library. There were free festivals and parties in squats. There were a huge range of clubs from the small hippie clubs to giant dance clubs. The large clubs were expensive night's out and drinks were costly so we didn't do that often. We were pretty skint so we went to smaller clubs and gigs usually. There was often a house party to be found if you knew enough people. Most people I knew used intoxicants of one sort or another but how common that was I couldn't say either.

We sometimes went to the cinema especially if it was a huge film or a special showing. We went out to eat in boisterous places where we shared the food. I do remember going to the ballet once with my friends, seats in the gods.

How late you stayed out depended on if you still lived with your parents, were a student at uni, or were a party animal.

We stayed out till the club's or pubs shut, then we'd all pile back to someone's house. Sometimes you ended up going back with strangers or friends of a friend that you'd met while out as long as there were a few of you. Safety in numbers.

Some pubs had late night opening licences. Sometimes you'd get an after hours lock in but only if you knew the bar owners. I think last orders were at about 11. Do they still ring a bell and call 'last orders'? Pubs would shut in the afternoon then reopen in the evening but I can't remember if this was just on Sundays.

Clubs were open until the early hours, after midnight I'm pretty sure. Illegal raves and parties went on all night. I seem to remember we were more restricted by the trains stopping than the clubs closing. The night busses were our other way home.

I think the late showing at the cinema was about 10pm start.

Shops closed at 5 or 6pm except the corner shops. The Sunday trading act was 1994 and that really changed things. You couldn't shop on a Sunday until then. I remember late night opening at the shopping centre mid 90s was extended to 8pm on a Thursday. Supermarkets started to stay open until 10 on a Saturday night and at some point after that 24 hour supermarkets started.

As I said, my memory might be a bit off as it was a fair while ago, but I hope that helps a bit, or points you in the right direction anyway.
