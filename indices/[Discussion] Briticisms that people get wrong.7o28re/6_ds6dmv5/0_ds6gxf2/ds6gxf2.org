Alright, I have a question which I failed to find any decent results for through google. How were the opening hours of stores, pubs, cinemas and so on in the mid-90s? I found some info on the Licensing Act 2003 but very little on the time before. I know that pubs closed before midnight but what about the other stores? How late could you watch a movie? How long did young adults (18-22) stay out at night and what did they do back then?
