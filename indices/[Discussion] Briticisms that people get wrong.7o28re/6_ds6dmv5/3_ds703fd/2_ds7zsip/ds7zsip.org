We always use the full name of the road, so "Charing Cross Road", "Fleet Street" etc. Some roads don't include "road" or "street", like "Cheapside", "Cornhill", "London Wall" and we wouldn't add anything to those.

Some roads and stations have the same name "Tottenham Court Road" and "Chancery Lane" for instance. Usually you can tell from context which one you're talking about, but if necessary we'd add "station".
