When I was in London I /think/ I remember the station being called "Charring Cross" (without road) and that's how it is [[http://imgur.com/IpG5QX4.jpg][on the tube map]].

Would a native speaker still refer to it as "Charring Cross Road"? Here it's common to simply use the tube/tram station names, but I mean Brits are weird so who knows? :P
