The biggest annoyances for me are geographical errors, and errors in place names.

Yankee authors need to stop leaving "street" or "road" off a road name. It's Privet Drive, not Privet. It's Charing Cross Road, not Charing Cross.

People need to at least glance at a damned map before writing about places. Too often Harry goes from Little Whinging to Surrey and then gets the tube to somewhere. This is impossible. You can't go from Little Whinging to Surrey, because if you're in Little Whinging you're already in Surrey, and the tube network doesn't go to Surrey. It's like saying that he went from San Francisco to California and then got the Q train to Times Square.

Oh, and it's Surrey, not Surrey county.
