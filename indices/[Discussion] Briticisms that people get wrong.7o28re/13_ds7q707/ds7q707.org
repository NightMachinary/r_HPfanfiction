As I grew up reading the books as an American child and have lived over in the U.K. for many years, I have to say I really began to appreciate a lot of details from the books by getting to know Britain (and the little itty bitty details one must live in a country to see) a lot more. A particular one is spellotape. What in the states it's just tape or scotch tape (like 1% of the time), in the U.K. is sellotape. And that revelation floored me! So while some Britishisms are stupid, irritating, and take a minutia of common sense -others are things I'd never have thought of until living full time in England.
