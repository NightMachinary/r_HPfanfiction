Has there every been a fic that explored the strange phenomenon of Pancake Day? I realise it's a Christian thing and all, but maybe a few Muggleborns gathered in once a year to secretly make pancakes... I remember it being a bit of a thing at my school and, having come from abroad, thought it was a bit weird.
