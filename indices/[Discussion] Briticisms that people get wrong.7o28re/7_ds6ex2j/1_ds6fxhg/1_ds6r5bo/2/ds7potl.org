Don't get me started on pancake day! THEY'RE CREPES! The French call them crepes, Americans call them crepes... they are not the same thing as pancakes! Excuse. There are few Britishisms (or British words) that set me on edge as an American, but that is one of them. Funnily enough, I have found pancakes very common in a lot of cafes that I frequent (and I live up north). Even funnier still, the best pancakes I ever had were at Claridge's in London when I was a child staying there with my parents. And I always put Lyle's on them... my life has really turned into a mumble-jumble of British and American traditions.
