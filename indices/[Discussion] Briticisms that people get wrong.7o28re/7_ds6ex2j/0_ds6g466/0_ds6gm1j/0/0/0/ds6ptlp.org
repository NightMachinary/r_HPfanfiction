I suppose you're right, I guess? But still, it doesn't excuse authors claiming their stories are successfully brit-picked and all that when they haven't done their research.

Literally one episode of /Eastenders//any soap opera/British sitcom will give an author pretty much everything they need to know about how English works in the UK, and I'm sure there are places they can look to find out, or people they can ask about it.
