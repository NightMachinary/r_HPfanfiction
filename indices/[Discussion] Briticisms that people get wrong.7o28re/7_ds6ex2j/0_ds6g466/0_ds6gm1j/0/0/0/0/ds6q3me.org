I agree completely that people writing fanfiction should research more, I was mostly commenting on the fact that readers would probably still miss things like that. I'm Italian and I like to think that I have a pretty good grasp of the language, but sometimes you find things that you never could have guessed at, if it wasn't explicitly told.
