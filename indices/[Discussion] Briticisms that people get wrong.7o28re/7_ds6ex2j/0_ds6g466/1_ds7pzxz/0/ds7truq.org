I just think it makes more sense for her character to be excited and stating that she hopes there's pudding (the course) at the welcoming feast, as there always is, so the whole statement seems erroneous and weird - I.e. like Luna normally sounds. As another user said earlier, in the UK there are lots of "puddings" that encompass many flavours, textures and seasonal themes, so to say you want "pudding" in this country without specifying more closely what you mean much more strongly implies you mean the course rather than any individual dish that could be described as a pudding, or have pudding in the name.

My problem is like where authors get attached to Snape using "Dunderhead", in that they see a word used in one specific instance, and either overuse it as-is or (as the case seems to be here - to me at least) misconstrue the context of someone's statement.
