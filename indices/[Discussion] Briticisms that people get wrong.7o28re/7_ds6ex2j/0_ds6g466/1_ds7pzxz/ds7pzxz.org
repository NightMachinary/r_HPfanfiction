I don't know how I interpreted this... knowing pudding means dessert but also knowing pudding is a specific dessert. I think either way Luna could have meant it would make it funny tbh. Why would American pudding be a British feast (I have yet to see pudding in the U.K. - mousse is not the same thing - though I think angels whip (angels dessert?) might be the same thing?) or why wouldn't there be pudding at a feast?
