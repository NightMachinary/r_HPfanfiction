On top of that, the misuse of "pudding" definitely gets on my nerves - in my experience, it is generally used to describe the course during a dinner, /not/ an individual type of dessert like lots of authors think.

So when Luna says "I hope there's pudding" I choose to interpret it as her hoping there's dessert of some kind (which there pretty much always is at dinner, so the weird/nonsensical statement fits perfectly with the way she normally behaves), not that there's one specific thing called "pudding" at the feast for her. Even if that /were/ the case, to which pudding would she be amenable? Black pudding? Christmas pudding? /Yorkshire pudding?/

When I see authors make Luna into some kind of weird pudding glutton it's a serious effort not to cringe myself into nonexistence.
