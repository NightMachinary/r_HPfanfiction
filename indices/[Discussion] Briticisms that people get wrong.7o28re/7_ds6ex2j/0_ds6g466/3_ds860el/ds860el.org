A pudding is a particular type of dish, which is generally cooked by boiling, steaming, or baking, contains flour and fat, and is served warm and moist. For example, spotted dick (a sweet pudding), and steak and kidney pudding (a savoury pudding) are both on the Hogwarts menu at least some of the time.

Given that we can expect there to always be dessert (otherwise known as the pudding course even if pudding isn't served), it is clear that Luna is expressing a preference for particular dishes, not just hoping that there will be something sweet to eat.
