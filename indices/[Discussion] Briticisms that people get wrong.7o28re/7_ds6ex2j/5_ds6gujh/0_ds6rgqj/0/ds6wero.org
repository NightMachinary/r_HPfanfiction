I have no idea. It wasn't like I said, "Your story sucks you unsophisticated tart! Oh, and by the way, THE UK HATES PANCAKES FOR BREAKFAST!" I was calm in my review and mentioned the pancakes like a passing thought. But the author, haven forbid if anyone corrects him/her, replied in all caps and exclamation points. Maybe the author felt I was attacking the story...? Not sure but clearly critical assessment is a foreign entity of the unknown to the author.
