Also for what's it worth, I don't like pancakes for breakfast at all. Whenever I do have them, I like them for dinner (with a square of butter, a small dollop of Maple syrup, fresh strawberries, and a little whipped cream). I grew up eating pancakes for breakfast here in America, but my tastes and preferences for them has changed.
