For what it's worth, I have actually had pancakes in London. It was at a diner that was based on an American-style diner and called ... Diner. They even had blueberry ones. But, the syrup wasn't American style, but rather straight up Canadian maple syrup which isn't nearly as sweet. Also, I don't think they brought butter. I think I remember having to ask for it.
