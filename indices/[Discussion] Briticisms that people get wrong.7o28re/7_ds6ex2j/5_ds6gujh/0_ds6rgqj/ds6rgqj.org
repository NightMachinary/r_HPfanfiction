I don't get why they get so defensive. I fucked up a small thing in my latest chapter and had someone point it out. I didn't freak out, I just told them they were right, my bad, and went and edited it. It's just so much better. No one is angry. There's no trouble. You haven't lost a reader. You don't spend part of your day angry.
