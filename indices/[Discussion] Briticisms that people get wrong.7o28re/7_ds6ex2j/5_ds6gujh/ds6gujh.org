I read a story once where the author inserted the use of pancakes in his/her story for Harry and his gang to eat for breakfast. In a review, I mentioned that pancakes weren't exactly a popular breakfast choice in the UK. The author replied to me as, "IT'S FANFICTION! GET OVER IT!" Needless to say, I clicked out of that story and haven't looked back.
