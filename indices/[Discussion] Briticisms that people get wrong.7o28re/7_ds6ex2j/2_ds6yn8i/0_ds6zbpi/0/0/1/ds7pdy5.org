My mother (while not a professional chef- a good enough one that she's been invited to cook in kitchens of friends restaurants and was frequently auctioned to cook dinner parties for my schools fundraisers growing up) has always said that she thinks it's a waste of time to make puff pastry. The frozen is going to be better than anything anyone can make in a hot kitchen and even when done perfectly makes no different. The only other boxed thing my mother ever made was brownies - the mix is the perfect ratio of flour/chocolate/etc. and she's never found a recipe from scratch she liked better!
