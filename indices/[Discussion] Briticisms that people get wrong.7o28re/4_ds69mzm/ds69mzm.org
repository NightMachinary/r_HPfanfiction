"Bloody buggering fuck/shite."

Am British, literally /nobody/ I know swears like this.

Swear words - in my experience - tend to be used in a singular moment to punctuate someone's displeasure, like this: "Fuck" "Shit" - notice people don't tend to say "Shite" anymore (at least where I'm from) - "Bugger" "Arse" (although I say "ass") "Wanker" "Bloody Hell" "Cock" "Bastard".

There're worse, of course, and some people who grow up in certain strata of society feel the need to add "Fucking" before and after literally as many words as possible, or deploy cruder insults when they're swearing at someone in particular, rather than just voicing surprise/shock/pain/irritation/etc.
