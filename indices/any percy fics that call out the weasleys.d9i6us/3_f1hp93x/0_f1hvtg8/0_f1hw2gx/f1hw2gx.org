I had some problems with “Escape” (my attitude towards Harmony is rather problematic and your story shows many of its problems), but when Harry & Hermione are out of picture, the story is so much better. And yes, Snape-McGonagall relationship is another beauty (again, that's one of saving graces for “Escape”). Thank you.
