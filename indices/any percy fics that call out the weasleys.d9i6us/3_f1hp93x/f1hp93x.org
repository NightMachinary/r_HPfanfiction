Am I allowed to mention one I writing? It's Percy centric but is based in the timeline of another story I wrote. The dynamic between his family and the split is looked at but because it diverts from cannon certain events unfold differently.

The story is Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12373273/1/Mr-and-Mrs-Percy-Weasley]]

While not finished it's very nearly there and I am actively writing it I promise.
