It's not /quite/ the same, but Harriet and her "cousin" (Sirius' son) Arcturus have a near-sibling relationship in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense). It's an AU where Tom Riddle did some introspection and decided to pursue politics instead of Horcruxes, so there was never a war, the Potters and all the Marauders are alive and well, but non-purebloods are banned from Hogwarts. And Riddle's aiming to restrict half-blood marriages next.

I avoided reading it for a while because the summary sounded a bit ordinary, but once I started, I quickly found that it's a very original story, weaving a whole new world that's merely inspired by canon rather than retreading it.
