Well worth the read, though it takes a bit to get into it. Young Harry makes a wish for a better life and a supernatural entity decides Harry deserves it. So the entity goes back in time far enough to change history to the point that, by the time young Harry makes his wish, someone is ready to step in and rescue him. Which means Regulus Black survives his canon death and grows badass. (There's also a slight crossover with James Bond.)
