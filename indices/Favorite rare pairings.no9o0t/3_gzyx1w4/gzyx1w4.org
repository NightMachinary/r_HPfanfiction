Hrm. Interesting question. For romances, I guess:

Harry and Narcissa.

Harry and Andromeda.

Harry and one of the Gryffindor Chasers (almost all I can find are a few one shots).

Harry/Delphini (Presuming she was born older. I hate the Cursed Child, but like the idea of a daughter of Riddle being around. I do think it makes more sense if she was born before his first death though.)

Harry/Cho (Y'know, I can count on one hand the number of Cho stories which are not brief one shots or tragedies, and even including those there remarkably aren't so many.)
