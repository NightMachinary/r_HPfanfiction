There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2900438/1/Unsung-Hero][Unsung Hero]], but IDK if that's what you're looking for. Features a Ravenclaw Harry with a BWL brother, but I don't think the author says anything negative about Slytherin (mostly Gryffindor).

Be forewarned, though, that it is *not* a H/Hr story. It's H/Lu. There's also infidelity, which is why I quit reading it, but you may not care.
