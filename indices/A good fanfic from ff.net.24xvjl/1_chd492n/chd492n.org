So I have something... It's my fanfiction and it isn't complete yet (it's over 150k words now, close to 200k, and I just posted ch29), but one of the things I am doing is trying to show the Slytherin side of the war in it. Example Draco doing the things he did for his family. What neutral families are faced with etc.

It's AU and one of the main characters is Neville. The pairing is Neville OC, but I think it could interest you. The OC is a Slytherin and Draco's twin sister. Also, I don't know if this will be a deal breaker for you, Harry isn't really a main character. He's still the chosen one etc, but most of my fic is told from Neville, Draco, and Graces' (the OC) POV. Occasionally other characters, but mostly those three.
