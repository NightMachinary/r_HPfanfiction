There's /When Harry Met Wednesday/, but [[/spoiler][even though it's Harry Potter's body, set in the Harry Potter universe, the personality isn't Harry Potter. The basic premise is that Harry was a twisted little kid, who would have fit in quite well with the Adams Family, but Dumbledore discovered this when he was still a little kid and reprogrammed him into something suitable for the hero Dumbledore needed him to be.]]
