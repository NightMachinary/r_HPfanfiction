I have a hard time describing this without spoilers. Harry and Hermione find Avalon, fall in love, and meet priestesses in Avalon who help to defeat Voldemort and help Hermione deal with the consequences. This author is much nicer to Ron than JKR is, so if you're looking for bashing look elsewhere.
