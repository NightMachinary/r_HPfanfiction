For a good indication of whether you can do something or not with magic (in canon!) you should always consult [[/u/taure]]'s [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VOF1eu_B7qpTeTUykW5ZGK2HJmVAG5WouY71a5AiRPo/edit][Headcanon]].\\
It's the best study of canon-magic and its limitations that I know of, and it has basically all examples from the book where we learn something about magic listed.

About your question: I don't think there is anything that says it's /impossble/, however:

  Relative factors affecting the difficulty of a transfiguration are those factors which concern the relative similarity of the two objects. The more similar the objects, the easier the transfiguration (subject to absolute factors). Relative factors include: relative size, relative shape, relative appearance and texture, and even similarities in name

Transfiguration becomes easier if things are similar in shape, material, size, name, ... - and air, being a compressible gas is quite dissimilar to bullets. Air molecules are tiny compared to bullets. Weapons are used to hurt people, air usually isn't. They are basically apart in every sense.

There is also the fact that 'Protego' blocks solid objects, so yeah. If the blocking of such object is easier than the creation than it's rather... useless.

Anyways, besides that we also know that you can conjure things out of thin air - however, these objects don't last. Doesn't really matter for weapons though. And other drawback is that conjuration is supposedly hard.

I do not know of any fic where individual molecules are transfigured.
