I wasn't even suggesting it was legally enforced marriage (whatever that means), but legally enforcing monogamy. At the very least Peterson accepts this obvious contradiction in his political views isn't a simple strawman, he what was essentially a consequentialist defense of the view ("society is better is we tilt it this way").

So to me, it doesn't even matter if he just pushes this as a non-political, moral view because it can't sit with his other view that those on the left are fundamentally wrong for wanting this type of reform in other areas. Either social reform to rectify hierarchies is wrong in all cases or it is sometimes justified.
