  the article by Nellie Bowles made it sound like Peterson is in favor of forcing random women to marry incels.

Peterson's idea is that, somehow, enforced monogamy is the solution to the incel "problem". It's no one else's fault if he can't be clear with his language, especially since polygamy is already illegal and socially the overwhelming view at this point, so it's a pointless position, frankly.

#+begin_quote
  socially enforced monogamy evolved culturally over a long period of time whereas, according to Peterson, some of the utopian policies on the left are based on an incorrect understanding of the biological differences between men and women and are therefore highly likely to have unintended consequences. and unlikely to have the intended ones.
#+end_quote

This is just ridiculous though, it's nothing but a naturalistic fallacy (x is good because it's natural or developed naturally). It's just a causal explanation for how something came to be, it doesn't lend any weight to the view that things should be that way. Any argument of this sort, which you have summarized as such, is demonstrably not the conclusion of a sound logical argument. Consider:

Negative (violent, distasteful, etc) reactions to homsexuality evolved culturally over long periods of time. Therefore, efforts by the left to normalize it and make it legal are likely to have unintended consequences etc etc.

The same logical formal as what you said, the same features in that homosexuality has for ages often been socially rejected, and yet this argument is unsound. As is Peterson's, therefore. Ignoring the silliness of objecting to the so-so-called "equality of outcome" response, this seems pretty obvious a problem.
