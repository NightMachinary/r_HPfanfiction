  And I don't think it's a constructive use of anyone's time to argue about a position that he doesn't hold.

I don't see how it's a position he doesn't hold when he articulated it as his view twice in the interview. He wasn't tricked into saying anything.

  I quoted that Taleb tweet because I think it's a bit too easy to call Naturalistic Fallacy!
#+end_quote

I don't see the relevance unless a "higher dimensional experience" is defined. The point is the argument was indisputably argued for poorly because the structure was not valid.

  I'm not saying that the tradition of monogamy is particularly good. but maybe it's better than the alternative - afaik anthropologists are pretty clear on the fact that cultures with monogamy experience less violence from sexually frustrated unattached males.
#+end_quote

Again, this doesn't make sense. Most societies (including North America) enshrine monogamy even in law, as well as in social practice. The existence of sexually frustrated young men isn't because monogamy has done the dodo.

  I wouldn't have said likely, but yeah, sure. I think it's possible that those attitudes developed for reasons beyond some insecure dudes being secretly worried that dicks are delicious.

You have misunderstood the point of the argument. The point being that the moral status of homosexuality (not people's opinions about it) has nothing to do with it being "natural" or "naturally developed" or not. That's the crux of the naturalistic fallacy.

  but our current state of social, cultural and technical development is not natural. it took a lot of work to build up. [...] and Petersons objection to the changes of the 'indentity politics left' is that they not only underestimate unintended consequences, but also are operating from a faulty position (radical social constructionism).
#+end_quote

This is essentially the silliest version of consequentialism. It's not that these changes are actually shown to have negative consequences (violent crime falls nearly every year, as it has for decades), but it's still bad because of /possible/ consequences (as opposed to the very real consequences of "traditional" views about homosexuals, transgender people, such as violence, hosing and medical discrimination, etc.). This ethical view is incoherent.

#+begin_quote
  not sure what you mean by that.
#+end_quote

Simply that the characterization of left wing views as equality of outcome is usually a strawman (e.g. universal health care isn't equality of outcome because the idea is that there's a basic coverage everyone gets, not that healthcare quality is at the same level for everyone).
