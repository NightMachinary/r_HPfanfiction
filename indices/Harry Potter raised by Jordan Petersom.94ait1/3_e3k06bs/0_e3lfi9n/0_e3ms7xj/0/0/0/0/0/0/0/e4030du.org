  I don't see how it's a position he doesn't hold when he articulated it as his view twice in the interview. He wasn't tricked into saying anything.
#+end_quote

I'll work on clarifying that.

The author of the article wrote the following about 'incels' just before quoting Peterson on enforced monogamy:

#+begin_quote
  Some believe in forced “sexual redistribution,” in which a governing body would intervene in women's lives to force them into sexual relationships.
#+end_quote

I hope you'll agree that Peterson doesn't hold that position. and maybe you'll even agree that it's a bit of a dirty tactic to write this just before quoting Peterson as saying this:

#+begin_quote
  “He was angry at God because women were rejecting him,” Mr. Peterson says of the Toronto killer. “The cure for that is enforced monogamy. That's actually why monogamy emerges.”
#+end_quote

if you haven't read it, here is Peterson's clarification of his position:

[[https://jordanbpeterson.com/media/on-the-new-york-times-and-enforced-monogamy/]]

the part that's missing from that, I think, is the explanation why this at all relevant. because, as you pointed out, monogamy is the norm already.

this is a bit of a compilation of things Peterson has said in different conversations: while monogamy is still the norm, the opinions on sex before marriage and casual sex have changed drastically since birth control became reliable. and in the casual sex game, the rates of success for men are more like a in polygyny system: a few men have a lot of success, some have a bit of success, and a lot have no success.

where it becomes difficult, imo, is quantifying the influence of this change on the violent behaviors of sexually frustrated young males. I don't think it's zero. but I also don't think it's quite as high as Peterson seems to think, to justify calling enforced monogamy "the cure" - I think there are more things in play here.

maybe this is a good segue to the naturalistic fallacy topic. if you trust the research done on male violence (some of which Peterson quoted in the blog post linked above) it is an evolved behavior. as such I would call it natural. but I don't think it's good. it just is. And while we might say that violence is morally wrong we can't just change this behavior by changing the rules. I don't mean we shouldn't, I mean that we are biological creatures with inherited hardware and firmware. we may be the blankest slate of all the animals with the greatest amount of learned behaviors, but we definitely aren't a completely blank slate. ignoring that reality and trying to change things through laws - well, Peterson thinks that's what led to the horrors of communism. I don't know enough about it to completely sign on to that, so I'll stick to high probability of unintended consequences and low probability of intended consequences.

you defined the fallacy as "x is good because it's natural or developed naturally". I don't think I'm saying that. merely that x is real.

#+begin_quote
  This is essentially the silliest version of consequentialism. It's not that these changes are actually shown to have negative consequences (violent crime falls nearly every year, as it has for decades), but it's still bad because of /possible/ consequences (as opposed to the very real consequences of "traditional" views about homosexuals, transgender people, such as violence, hosing and medical discrimination, etc.).
#+end_quote

pretty sure that I haven't said that I'm against all changes. I said:

#+begin_quote
  the key to a civilization not stagnating or imploding is the right amount of change. traditions etc. need to be updated to fit the present (and if clear, the future).
#+end_quote

are you saying that the reduction in violent crime over the past decades is the sole result of the social constructionist policies of the radical left? (whose reality-estranged ideas I'm opposing here)

#+begin_quote
  Simply that the characterization of left wing views as equality of outcome is usually a strawman (e.g. universal health care isn't equality of outcome because the idea is that there's a basic coverage everyone gets, not that healthcare quality is at the same level for everyone).
#+end_quote

sorry, I'm used to that phrase from the Jordan Peterson subreddit where it specifically refers to those policies that aim at equality of outcome. not all left wing views. I agree with your point about healthcare. examples are gender parity (especially at the CEO level), the "gender pay gap" and prioritization of diversity over competence.

I hope this clarified where I'm coming from.
