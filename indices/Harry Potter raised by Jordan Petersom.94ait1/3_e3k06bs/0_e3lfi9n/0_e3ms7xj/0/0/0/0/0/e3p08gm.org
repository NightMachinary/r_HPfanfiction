  Peterson's idea is that, somehow, enforced monogamy is the solution to the incel "problem". It's no one else's fault if he can't be clear with his language, especially since polygamy is already illegal and socially the overwhelming view at this point, so it's a pointless position, frankly.

I think he made a mistake when he said that it's "the cure". in a good conversation / interview they could have dug deeper into the idea and gotten to the interesting part - instead the focus was put on the ridiculous end of the argument. And I don't think it's a constructive use of anyone's time to argue about a position that he doesn't hold.

  This is just ridiculous though, it's nothing but a naturalistic fallacy (x is good because it's natural or developed naturally).

  If you do not treat Tradition as (high dimensional) "experience", you stand against science and statistical significance --the spine of experimental science.

I quoted that Taleb tweet because I think it's a bit too easy to call Naturalistic Fallacy!

I'm not saying that the tradition of monogamy is particularly good. but maybe it's better than the alternative - afaik anthropologists are pretty clear on the fact that cultures with monogamy experience less violence from sexually frustrated unattached males. And I think you need to be able to seriously ask the question whether the rise in such violence in recent times may be causally linked to the widespread availability of reliable contraception and the increase in casual sexual encounters.

  Negative (violent, distasteful, etc) reactions to homsexuality evolved culturally over long periods of time. Therefore, efforts by the left to normalize it and make it legal are likely to have unintended consequences etc etc.

I wouldn't have said /likely/, but yeah, sure. I think it's possible that those attitudes developed for reasons beyond some insecure dudes being secretly worried that dicks are delicious. not sure what those reasons might have been, and whether they're still relevant today, but I don't think it's far fetched to think that normalizing homosexuality might have unintended consequences. so far it looks like we got lucky, but who knows. (I feel it's necessary to mention that I, personally, am in favor of this change)

the key to a civilization not stagnating or imploding is the right amount of change. traditions etc. need to be updated to fit the present (and if clear, the future). but our current state of social, cultural and technical development is not /natural./ it took a lot of work to build up. any change you make may have unintended consequences. the left tends to underestimate those unintended consequences, the right tends to overestimate them. and Petersons objection to the changes of the 'indentity politics left' is that they not only underestimate unintended consequences, but also are operating from a faulty position (radical social constructionism).

  Ignoring the silliness of objecting to the so-so-called "equality of outcome" response

not sure what you mean by that.
