sorry, bringing 'enforced marriage' into it wasn't ideal. here's how I got there: afaik bigamy/polygamy is already illegal in the west. and the article by Nellie Bowles made it sound like Peterson is in favor of forcing random women to marry incels. and you contrasted the monogamy thing with attempts from the left to /legally/ orient society in ceratin ways. all that amounted to the assumption that you think Petersons position is something like the marriage law trope.

I don't remember exactly how Peterson has responded to the accusation that he only wants to artificially influence hierarchies when it suits him, but I think a crucial difference between this issue and recent 'equality of outcome ' policies is that socially enforced monogamy evolved culturally over a long period of time whereas, according to Peterson, some of the utopian policies on the left are based on an incorrect understanding of the biological differences between men and women and are therefore highly likely to have unintended consequences. and unlikely to have the intended ones.
