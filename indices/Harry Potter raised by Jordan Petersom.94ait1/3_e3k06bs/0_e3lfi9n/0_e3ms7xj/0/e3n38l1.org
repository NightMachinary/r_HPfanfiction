[I don't really want to start a Peterson discussion in this subreddit, but I think it should be OK in this thread]

do you really believe that Peterson, the guy who objects to the government compelling his speech, is in favor of legally enforced marriage? maybe a HP fanfiction fan is particularly susceptible to this interpretation because of the marriage law trope...

"enforced monogamy" may have been a poor choice of words in that interview but Peterson has since clarified what he meant. and it wasn't legally enforced marriage.

I realize that there's a limited amount of time in a day, and not everyone is interested in this topic enough to dig a bit deeper. but staying on the strawman level of interpretation seems unwise to me if the topic is important enough to comment on a "Harry Potter raised by Jordan Peterson" thread.
