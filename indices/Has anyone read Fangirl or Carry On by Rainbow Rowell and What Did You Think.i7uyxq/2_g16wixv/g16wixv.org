I love Fangirl and how accurately Rainbow Rowell depicts fanfiction. Then again, she did say that she was involved in it herself. But for whatever reason, I'm not particularly interested in reading Carry On. Maybe because the excerpts in Fangirl of "Cath"'s fics didn't really appeal to me? And I feel like I'd rather read Drarry fanfiction instead lol. But I think it's cool how she actually wrote Carry On! That's like ficception.
