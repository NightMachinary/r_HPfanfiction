I had the same reaction to Fangirl - it felt so accurate like it was written by someone who has dabbled into that world. I'd recommend Carry On. It's pretty awesome in its own right. In Fangirl it's just a cool plot device, but as its own story it's like a reinterpretation of the Harry Potter world but also a clear homage to it. It's hard to explain.
