Remember that scene where Cath runs into a girl who reads Carry On and they used the word "love scene"? I was half-expecting them to use "smut" hahaa. Also I love how fanfixx.net (was it .net?) is obviously fanfiction.net.

Okay, maybe I'll give Carry On a try! I feel like I haven't been into YA for a while. I can reread certain old favourites like Harry Potter and The Hunger Games but all new YA series I've tried just felt too...juvenile. But I've read and enjoyed everything else Rainbow Rowell has written.
