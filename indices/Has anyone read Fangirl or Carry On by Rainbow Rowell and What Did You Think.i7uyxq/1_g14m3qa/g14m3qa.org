Actually, I had no idea fanfiction existed, I was obsessed with Harry Potter and other franchises but I had no idea fanfiction existed. Then I read Fangirl.

And then I started reading fanfiction and haven't really stopped ever since. So Fangirl will always hold a very special place in my heart, because it introduced me to fanfiction and nowadays I can't even imagine how life would be without fanfiction.
