That's the beauty of fanfiction: no matter who your favourite characters are or your favourite pairing, there's probably a bunch of fics out there to read. Draco has always been my favourite character, so I mostly end up reading Dramione fics, but I also love Snape as a character and have read some good Snape fics as well.
