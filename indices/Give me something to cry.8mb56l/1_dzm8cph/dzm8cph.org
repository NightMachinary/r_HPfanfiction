[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/54obkd/request_something_to_have_a_good_cry_over/d83sx2a]] is first and foremost the most comprehensive thing I have for you.

linkffn(Speak Softly, Love by Silens Cursor) fits very well, except its about Antonin Dolohov. Very solid.

linkffn(Don't You Worry by Potato19) deals with Harry's wife dying in childbirth and the father he became. Has its tear jerking moments.

linkffn(Letters by Morning Lilies) is solid as well.
