Weird complaint. I mean, all HP fanfics are derived from a series where the three main characters are all white and straight. Since these characters are the "main characters", they're usually the ones people write about.

Hermione is absolutely a strong woman in a non-stereotypical role pre and post-war, in both canon and fanfiction. In fact, most fanfic authors are more willing to turn a blind eye to Hermione's faults than JKR is.

And if you think there aren't that many fics with gay characters or portrayals of homosexual relationships in fanfiction, you clearly haven't been looking in the right places.
