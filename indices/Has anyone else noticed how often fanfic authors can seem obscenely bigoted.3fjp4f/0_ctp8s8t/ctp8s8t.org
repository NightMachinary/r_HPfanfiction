I hate when writers project real world prejudices unto the wizarding world. The wizarding world is not sexist, stop trying to pass Victorian era social mores as wizarding social mores. The wizarding world isn't backwards, its just different.

It iss virtually devoid of traditional racism and sexism.

They have their own prejudices involving blood and fantastical rascism to deal with. They don't need to be potrayed as some sort of stuffy Victorians with magic.
