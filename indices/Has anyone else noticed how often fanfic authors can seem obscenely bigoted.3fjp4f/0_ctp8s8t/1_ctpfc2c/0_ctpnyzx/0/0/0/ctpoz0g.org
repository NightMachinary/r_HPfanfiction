but it'd have to be present in wizard culture for ron to think it's insulting and for ginny to have reacted as she did. she didn't say 'what? that's weird. that's not even a thing'. it's like if i called you a cotton headed ninnymuggin, you're not going to be enraged so much as you'd be confused. women opposing misogyny isn't indicative of an absence of misogyny.
