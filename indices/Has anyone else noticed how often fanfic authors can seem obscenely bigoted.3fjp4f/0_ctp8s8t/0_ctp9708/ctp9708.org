So much this. The first female Minister for Magic was in 1798, so sexism is a prejudice the magical world seemed to do away with not so long after parting ways with the Muggle world.

Another thing worth remembering is that the Hogwarts Quidditch stadium has unisex changing rooms, which is something you'd have to go to Scandinavia to see in the Muggle world. So the wizarding world isn't particularly prudish either.
