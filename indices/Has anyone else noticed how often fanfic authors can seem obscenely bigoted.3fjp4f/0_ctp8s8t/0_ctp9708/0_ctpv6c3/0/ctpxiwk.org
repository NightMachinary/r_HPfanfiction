It's from Philosopher's Stone Chapter 11:

  Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green).

  Wood cleared his throat for silence.

  “Okay, men,” he said. "And women,” said Chaser Angelina Johnson.

  “And women,” Wood agreed. “This is it.”

  “The big one,” said Fred Weasley.

It's not clear if this changing room has showers or not:

PoA Chapter 9:

  “But the match,” said Harry. “What happened? Are we doing a replay?”

  No one said anything. The horrible truth sank into Harry like a stone.

  “We didn't --- lose?”

  “Diggory got the Snitch,” said George. “Just after you fell. He didn't realize what had happened. When he looked back and saw you on the ground, he tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and square... even Wood admits it.”

  “Where is Wood?” said Harry, suddenly realizing he wasn't there.

  “Still in the showers,” said Fred. “We think he's trying to drown himself.”

These could very well be the showers in the dorms, not the stadium, but the use of "still" seems to imply a normal routine of post-Quidditch showers and Wood is taking longer than normal.

If there are showers, I'd imagine they're cubicles rather than an open shower room. Hogwarts may not be prudish, but mixed gender showers stretch belief a bit far.
