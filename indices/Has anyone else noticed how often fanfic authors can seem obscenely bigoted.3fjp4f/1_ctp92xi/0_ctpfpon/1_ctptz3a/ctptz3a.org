I get what you're saying but at the end of the day Rowling was writing about children in the 90s at a British boarding school for (what she was assuming would be) an audience of British children. It's expected that the majority of the characters would be English and white because that is largely what the makeup of the UK is - white and English. There are some incidental Welsh characters, some Scottish characters, and also some BME characters, but largely everyone is white and English because that's her audience and the reality of the setting.
