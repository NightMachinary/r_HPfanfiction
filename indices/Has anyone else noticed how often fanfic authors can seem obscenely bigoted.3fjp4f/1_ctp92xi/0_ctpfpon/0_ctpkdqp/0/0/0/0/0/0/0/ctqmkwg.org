I'll say it again: there's nothing wrong with having an all-white main cast and there's nothing wrong with an all-nonwhite main cast. Neither is absurd. One can choose to center a story around more characters of that 16% and it would not be absurd. That's all I'm saying.

I don't think there's anything wrong with ambiguity on whether racism or blood purism is happening, because they parallel each other. I don't think it's distracting; I think it could strengthen the story, if written well. But I think this is veering into personal interpretation of HP and more hypotheticals, so I can agree to disagree.
