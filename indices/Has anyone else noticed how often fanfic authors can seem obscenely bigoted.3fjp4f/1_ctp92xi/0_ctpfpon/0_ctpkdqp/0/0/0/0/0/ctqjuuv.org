  I'm intentionally ignoring why most people here are having such a negative response to the subject of race in this comment section. That's what you meant to say, right?
#+end_quote

No, I really don't know what they're trying to say. That was in the first post I posted in this thread. I think OP is a drama-baiting troll. But that doesn't negate the other discussions I'm having, that are not related to OP. If those discussions are related to OP, I'd like those people to tell me.

  How? If Harry, and the Dursleys, were black, people would complain about the racism of having yet another dysfunctional black family. If Ron were black, everyone would complain about yet another financially poor black family depiction. If Hermione was black, people would whine about a black character having unruly hair.

Who are these people? Someone on the street? Facebook trolls? People complain about everything. What are their reasons?

I know one good reason: sometimes things get called out because they don't go beyond the stereotype. A badly-written black character is bad representation. Stereotypes aren't bad; relying on them and not going beyond them is bad--bad writing to be exact.

  All of the above is pointless however, because the books aren't about tackling racism. The primary discriminatory force in the wizarding world is classism. That's why I almost believe that it's a mistake for there to have been any POC's in Harry Potter; it muddies the issue and distracts from the point. It'd be as if District 9 deviated from its Apartheid allegory to talk about the HIV epidemic.

Wait, wait, wait, are you saying having Black and Asian people /distract/ from storytelling? How is a white main character less distracting, or better, or however you mean? Why should a white perspective be the universal example? Classism isn't white-only. White isn't a default race. Why can't a Black person's perspective speak to White and Asian people as well? Because all of us non-White people are perfectly capable of absorbing white-led media all the time, but we hardly ever get the favor returned.

  Please keep the sex stuff out of the children's books. Please!

There's nothing explicit about having an openly queer character.

  It feels absurd because there was never any indication that racial demographics were being messed with for the story. The general rule for fantasy writing is that once you've picked out the stuff you want to make magical, you leave the rest alone. This way the audience can easily accept the fantastical by latching onto the familiar.

Imagine Hermione is Black. Neville and Snape are Asian. No racial demographics being messed with (I was only suggesting it as a hypothetical). No storylines are changed. Only physical description. Is that absurd? There are times where I'd like to see culture-specific issues addressed and there are times when I'd be ecstatic if there were just more characters who are stated to be of color. Hermione being black doesn't automatically affect the storyline any more than being white, it's all down to the writing. But in her example, I think it adds an interesting depth, considering her blood purity. There's no requirement that a story has to openly address her race AND her blood purity; the metaphor is already there with blood purity.
