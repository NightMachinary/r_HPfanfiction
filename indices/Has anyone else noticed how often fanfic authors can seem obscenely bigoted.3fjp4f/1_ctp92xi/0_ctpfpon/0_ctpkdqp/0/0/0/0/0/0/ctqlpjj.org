  Wait, wait, wait, are you saying having Black and Asian people distract from storytelling?

No. I'm saying that if the story, even on a metaphorical level, isn't about race, then there's no reason to screw around with it. Britain is a white nation, to the tune of 84%, so it makes sense to have the vast majority of characters be white. If the story were set in India, I would say the same thing except that "White" would be replaced with "Indian".

  Imagine Hermione is Black... Hermione being black doesn't automatically affect the storyline any more than being white...

The plot? Sure, the subtext and audience attention? No. Remember that Hermione was picked on and insulted because of her mudblood status and almost anti-social character quirks. If she is black and this happens in a school that is predominately white, other character reactions would be misconstrued as racist. Which would distract from the other themes that the audience /should/ be paying attention to.
