I'm ignoring OP here because I don't know what they were trying to say. I've been saying exactly what what I said in the comment above--it would be easy for Harry Potter to have more representation of race and sexuality if it wanted to, even if it does not reflect our demographics, because people seem to find that idea absurd. There's nothing wrong with having a white cast and there's nothing wrong with a completely nonwhite cast.
