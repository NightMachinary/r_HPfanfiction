  I'm ignoring OP here because I don't know what they were trying to say.

I'm intentionally ignoring why most people here are having such a negative response to the subject of race in this comment section. That's what you meant to say, right?

#+begin_quote
  it would be easy for Harry Potter to have more representation of race...
#+end_quote

How? If Harry, and the Dursleys, were black, people would complain about the racism of having yet another dysfunctional black family. If Ron were black, everyone would complain about yet another financially poor black family depiction. If Hermione was black, people would whine about a black character having unruly hair.

All of the above is pointless however, because the books aren't about tackling racism. The primary discriminatory force in the wizarding world is */classism./* That's why I almost believe that it's a mistake for there to have been /any/ POC's in Harry Potter; it muddies the issue and distracts from the point. It'd be as if District 9 deviated from its Apartheid allegory to talk about the HIV epidemic.

Please keep the sex stuff out of the children's books. /Please!/

#+begin_quote
  ...even if it does not reflect our demographics, because people seem to find that idea absurd.
#+end_quote

It feels absurd because there was never any indication that racial demographics were being messed with for the story. The general rule for fantasy writing is that once you've picked out the stuff you want to make magical, you leave the rest alone. This way the audience can easily accept the fantastical by latching onto the familiar.

  There's nothing wrong with having a white cast and there's nothing wrong with a completely nonwhite cast.
#+end_quote

I agree, and someone needs to tell OP that. (S)he is literally saying that having a non-white cast has enabled fanfic writers to be noticeably bigoted.
