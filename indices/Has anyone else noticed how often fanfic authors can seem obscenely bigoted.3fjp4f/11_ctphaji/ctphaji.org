I'm pretty sure I read an article the other day that said literally the only line about Hermione's skin color was "very brown" in PoA. She's described as "very brown" at least once, to me that says she could easily be not white. I'd have to go page by page all seven books to see if that's really the only line, but the wonderful thing about books is that unless it's explicitly stated, the characters can look like whatever. Lots of us thought Blaise was female until it was revealed later on since we didn't really get much interaction with him until then.
