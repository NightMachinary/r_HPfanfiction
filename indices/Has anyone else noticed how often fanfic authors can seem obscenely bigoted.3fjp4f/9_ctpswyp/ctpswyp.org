I somewhat agree with the sentiment, and there are solutions to the problem, but as it stands, the fandom is what you make of it.

In my opinion JKR did a pretty good job given the circumstances. There are powerful women in the series. There are powerful PoC, too. It is true that they didn't get as many lines as some of us would have liked, but nothing is stopping us from changing that online.

She wrote a story about Harry. We can do the same, but we don't /have/ to.

For those who want a higher level of minority representation in their fics, it might be a good idea to compile a list of stories which have done so to date, and take it from there.

I'm not dismissing the issue, as it's something I'm subtly trying to do in my own fics, but it's unfortunately the type of issue that many cover their ears at on impulse.
