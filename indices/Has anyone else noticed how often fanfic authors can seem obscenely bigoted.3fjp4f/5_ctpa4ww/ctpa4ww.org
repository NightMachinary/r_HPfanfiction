Good lord, what a shitstorm already. I have no idea what question you're asking, nor what people in this thread are attacking because you're so vague that I feel like everyone's just projecting meaning onto your words? Harry Potter covered a lot of great social issues but it really isn't the best representation-wise, but to say it spawns bigots is way off. Again, have no idea what you're trying to say.

It'd be nice to have a reasonable discussion about some of the flaws in the series that fandom tries to remedy, because JKR does write a mother/monster dichotomy into her female characters to distinguish between good and bad traits, and devalues emotional characters like Lavender and Cho. Just because the wizarding world doesn't have our kind of sexism doesn't mean the writing doesn't inflate beliefs from our world. And HP isn't diverse in terms of race nor sexuality. It's not discriminatory for that, but it's just plainly not diverse in these qualities. It's how most of our media unfortunately is. Attacking past media for being a product of its time is non-productive. We should focus on how to encourage more diverse media for the future and question why we're /still/ whitewashing people who are canonically of color or not representing when we can (like Newt Scamander; JKR said his grandson was swarthy in an interview and you might not take that as canon, but casting him for /Fantastic Beasts/ was still a major opportunity to put a lead PoC into the HP world and it didn't happen. Nor for the rest of the cast).

But really, my top concern is whether or not you're drama-baiting because looking at your post history, I wouldn't be surprised.
