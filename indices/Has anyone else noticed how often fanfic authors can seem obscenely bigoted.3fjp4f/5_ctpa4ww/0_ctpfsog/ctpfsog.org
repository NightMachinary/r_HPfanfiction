  It'd be nice to have a reasonable discussion about some of the flaws in the series that fandom tries to remedy, because JKR does write a mother/monster dichotomy into her female characters to distinguish between good and bad traits, and devalues emotional characters like Lavender and Cho.

Personally I think fandom is much harsher towards Lavender and Cho than JKR ever was in the books.
