Not where I hang around thankfully, but I can imagine so. I think the way the characters are written, they're set up to compare against the female characters JKR favors, like Hermione and Ginny--JKR even said she used Cho to make Ginny look stronger. There's this general distaste toward emotional girls that I noticed while reading the books growing up, and I don't think it's all because it's Harry's PoV.
