I don't think its a flaw for the HP series or any one individual series unless they outright whitewash. I think its a flaw in media in general; its easier to see a literal female alien in a movie than an Asian woman. THAT should change.

I'm losing track of arguments because I'm on mobile, but there's been people who insist that the wizarding world doesn't have our sexism and racism but definitely has our demographics, and I have an issue with that selectivity in realism. I'm not saying the series should have gone one way or another with the realism but rather that this argument doesn't hold weight.
