That then raises the question of why JKR would choose to do so. For a start, making Muggle racial prejudice a plot point would rather undermine the focus on wizarding racial prejudices.

But there's a broader point too, which is that diversity isn't something valuable in and of itself. The reason why we value diversity is the principle of non-discrimination. Our society is diverse, which means that we expect the make-up of institutions to match that diversity. If they don't, then some kind of discrimination is at work. Diversity is valued therefore as a signal that society is just/non-discriminatory.

But if your society isn't diverse in the first place, then a lack of diversity does not signal discrimination. Indeed, to force artificial diversity where none exists in society is to discriminate, and so completely contrary to the reason why we're supposed to value diversity in the first place.
