Sorry, I accidentally responded too fast. Again, Im not saying half the population should be Indian, I'm saying it's not so strange to have one or two prominent minority characters. I don't think that streches the realm of realism nor does it need to have a justification. Is there anything shocking about a black major character?

Diversity does not equate to our-world racial discrimination storylines. Most people in this thread believe the series doesn't have our kind of racism. Why should that change? It could, but it certainly doesn't have to.

edit: I feel like people are getting caught up in my offhand mention of more black bloodlines; I was thinking like a writer when I mentioned that, meaning it as a possibility or just a mental detail to paint a potential history of magical Britain. Entire storylines do not need to be adjusted for this. It doesn't even have to be mentioned. It can just be a mental detail of the author so it inspires their world.
