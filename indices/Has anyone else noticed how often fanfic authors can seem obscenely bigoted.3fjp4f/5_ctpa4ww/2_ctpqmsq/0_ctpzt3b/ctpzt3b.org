I agree that it has themes of diversity in it! I completely think it has a lot of good things to say concerning diversity! But it's just literally not diverse when you're talking about race and sexuality, at least in terms of how its been representing in movies. And I've never called it the series' fault or flaw. It just IS. But I want to talk about WHY that is and how we can change that for future media.
