In this hypothetical, I don't mean racially determined, I mean just maybe it happens to exist in more black families.

The point isn't in this detail. A story doesn't HAVE to justify a black main character or more Asian side characters in Britain, as if it's cripplingly unrealistic to see them. That's what the demographic argument seems to say: "All main characters should be a white British boy with 1.5 siblings" as if one can't have a story in that 10% of minorities. And I have to keep saying this, but I've never said if a story followed demographics, that it is a bad thing.
