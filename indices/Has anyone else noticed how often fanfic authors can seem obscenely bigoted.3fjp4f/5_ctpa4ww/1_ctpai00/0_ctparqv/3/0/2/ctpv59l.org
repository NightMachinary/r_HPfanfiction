You obviously don't understand how fantastical fiction works. When you have something completely unbelievable in a story, such as magic, you need to ground everything else as much as possible in realism. This way the audience has something familiar to latch onto and thus accept the few weird/unrealistic elements as well. The story has nothing to do with anything racial (the wizarding world, as mentioned to you and others many times, has its own prejudices), therefore there's no need or purpose to screwing around with racial demographics.
