More magical black bloodlines? It's not hard to justify if JKR wanted it in her worldbuilding. It's based on the UK but it's still a fictional UK. You can do anything in that world. There's a flying noseless supervillain. Add in a fictional 10% more minorities?

You and the OP have a long history together looking at your comment history, so I question anything you bring up, too.

EDIT: I'm laughing because you're trying so hard to extend this argument and I know it's just going to lead to downvotes. You're ignoring everything I say except for a few things, and I don't think it's a coincidence you and OP posted threads at the same time that can turn out controversial. If you have to ask 'Why would the UK have more magical blood lines?' you clearly don't know what 'fiction' and 'worldbuilding' mean.
