this is the entire point. why not? there's no /logically/ justifiable reason for it. if you can create entirely different politics, abilities, realities, you can add more poc. the only reason you didn't is because you didn't want/think to. the question of 'why do you find it easier to create creatures and fantastical dynamics than feature more poc or prioritise their stories' is a good one.
