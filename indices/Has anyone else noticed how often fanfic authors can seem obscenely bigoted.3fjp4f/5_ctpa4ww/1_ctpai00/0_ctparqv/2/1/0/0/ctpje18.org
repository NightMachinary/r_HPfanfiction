Great word - that's exactly what is at stake here. JKR made a very clear choice to set her story in a real place and time. Once this decision was made, every detail she introduced about the magical world and magical/Muggle interactions had to serve a purpose in the telling of her story, which, like most fantasy, is at its core about a hero and a battle between good and evil.
