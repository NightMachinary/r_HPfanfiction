Wait, are you saying it's jarring and unrealistic if we saw slightly more non-white people in Harry Potter?

My issue is how people so quickly agree that the wizarding world wouldn't have our sexism and racism but it definitely needs to have our demographics. Why this selectivity in realism? If we're going to treat the wizarding world as an entirely separate culture, why couldn't this separate culture have had more Romani and Desi people? Or immigration--what if magical Britain is a hotspot for magical culture? There doesn't need to be a magical force to increase PoC. They just have to be written about.
