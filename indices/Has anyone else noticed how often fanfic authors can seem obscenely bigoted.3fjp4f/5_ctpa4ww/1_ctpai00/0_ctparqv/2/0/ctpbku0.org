I replied to the other comment: it's based on the UK but it's still a fictional UK. If JKR wanted diversity in her worldbuilding, it wouldn't have been hard. There are plenty of things that make much less sense in HP than having a few more characters of color.

Not every series has to be a bastion of diversity but it's something to discuss so we might have more diverse mainstream series in the future.
