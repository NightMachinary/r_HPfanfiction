Dean Thomas, Angelina Johnson, Lee Jordan, Blaise Zabini, Kingsley Shacklebolt (who becomes minister) all black characters.

Parvarti and Padma Patil- Indian

Cho- Asian

Tonks- Whatever she wants.

They're not main characters but there are plenty of races represented at Hogwarts in the demographics they should be.
