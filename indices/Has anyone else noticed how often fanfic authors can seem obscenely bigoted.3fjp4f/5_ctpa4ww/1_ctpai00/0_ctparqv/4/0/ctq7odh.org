I'm not going after HP for whitewashing, I'm only saying the story could have, hypothetically, featured more people of color, and it wouldn't be absurd. No one said anything about majority Asian Scotland.

But of Hogwarts had 5 Asian students in all and JKR decided to write about two of them as main characters--no demographic twisting at all!--would that be strange as well?
