Your argument doesn't work here because demographics are important to realism. If I'd picked up a book about mostly Asian students attending magic school in Scotland I would have laughed and probably thrown it back on the shelf because that's ridiculous.

If you want to go after something for not representing demographics try Noah, at least there you have a cast of white Europeans and Americans playing a middle eastern Jewish family.
