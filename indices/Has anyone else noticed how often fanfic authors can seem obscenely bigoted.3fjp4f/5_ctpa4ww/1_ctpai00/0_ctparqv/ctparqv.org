And that isn't very diverse; I'm not knocking HP for it. /The demographics weren't diverse and so HP isn't diverse./

I think it's a silly argument against diversity in general, though, similar to how "rape is historically accurate" so it's "realistic" to show it all the time in TV!GoT but so is dysentery and they don't show that. These are fictional stories. They doesn't have to be bound by the demographics of the real world. I mean look--this entire thread is arguing that sexism and racism don't exist in the Wizarding World like it does in our world. So why do they have to follow our demographics? Again, not knocking them if they do, but it's food for thought for any writers out there.
