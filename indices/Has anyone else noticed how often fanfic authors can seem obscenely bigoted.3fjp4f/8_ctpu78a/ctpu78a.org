I've actually read a lot of fanfics where the authors seem a bit prejudiced in one way or another. I read one fanfic where there was a ton of random Muslim-bashing that really didn't fit in to the rest of the narrative, I've read quite a few otherwise good fanfics where everyone is homophobic for no apparent reason even when there are no gay characters and the story has nothing to do with queer people in general...

Bear in mind I'm not talking about where the author probably doesn't feel these things but they're part of the story/characters for a reason to do with the plot/narrative, but incidences where these things are just present and they're kind of jarring because they don't actually fit the story and it seems like just a but where the author decided to go all editorial.

Sometimes I just stop reading when this happens, but I usually carry on regardless and view everything through a different perspective. IDK. Is annoying sometimes.
