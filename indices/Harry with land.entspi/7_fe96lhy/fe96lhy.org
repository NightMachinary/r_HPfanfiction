Harry has an OBSCENE amount of land in this one. I'm talking Newt Scamander levels of land. Mind you, this was before Fantastic Beasts came out too. He effectively has his own country? State? Dutchy? Anywho, he has farms, animals, Elf Villages, sports, houses. The sequel looks to be abandoned though. But the first story is worth reading in any right.
