Personally, my favourite 'Harry owns property' fic is probably Witches of Westfield. It's not so much about the property as it is about the things he does with it and the outcomes of those things, but it's pretty good.

There's also Novocaine, where Harry comes into ownership of a hydroponic winery in Australia.

One I find interesting is either Passageways or Charon. I know they both have the Nightshade family being a thing, but I can't for the life of me remember which one deals with estates and has a town of Nightshades that Harry looks after. Fair warning, both feature a collection of typical Indy!Harry tropes and I mostly enjoy them in the same way I enjoy B-Movie horror/action movies and schlocky comedy.

There's also a couple of Robst fics that deal with Harry buying property, but I don't particularly want to link those. Same with the myriad 'Harry inherits a million things'/'Harry finds Potter, Black, or Emrys property has been wrongfully hidden from him and he gets angry before living on it for a while' Indy!Harry fics.
