One of the best I have found is Harry Potter and the Harem War by Radaslab. It is as the title says a harem fic, something I have mostly moved away from, but I still quite enjoy this one. The Harem and a fight against Dumbledore is part of it but the biggest part is about an entire island/country Harry inherited and it really goes in-depth with a back story for House Potter. It's almost 750k in length but it is unfortunately unfinished as well. I definitely recommend it if you haven't read it or rereading it if you have.
