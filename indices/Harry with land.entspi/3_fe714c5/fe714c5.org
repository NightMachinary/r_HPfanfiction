There was a quite popular fic where Harry buys a land in Africa (it was a bit crossover, I think?), the seller was relieved because nobody was buying it for a while because it was really dangerous there. Harry harvests ingredients from wild animals and has a garden and exchanges letters with Sirius, I think. I clearly remember the part where Snape sees the new potions ingredients catalogue, gets shocked by quite low prices, wants to order many of these things but there's a tax added on the cheque saying smth like "greasy git tax - N galleons"

Don't remember the name though
