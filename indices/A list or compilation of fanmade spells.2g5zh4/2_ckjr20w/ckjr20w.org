Not a list, but the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Sacrifices Arc]] has the most fanmade spells I've ever seen. Not only are there huge numbers of brand new spells, but there's alternatives to a range of canon spells, expansion to wandless magic, and more detail into magical creatures. If you can get past AU & Draco/Harry then it's worth a read for that alone.
