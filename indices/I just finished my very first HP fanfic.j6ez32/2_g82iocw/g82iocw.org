Congrats! I'm also new, so take what I say with a grain of salt. Your lack of show is hurting you specifically in building tension.

First, you start telling us about Slytherin, lost opportunity to hook us with his wolf-like appearance.

Then, the Professor we're supposed to hate starts as a background guy, and you show us little. He just kind of exists as a background Professor, and there's no reaction. You could have made him any other Professor and it wouldn't changed anything. When you introduced him, that was the time to show us, make us curious. What's going on with Sam and this Professor?

And with romance, again, lost opportunity to build tension. Does Sam like him back? Is he shy? How much are they hiding their feelings? We don't ask these questions because Sam is a blank on those questions until she kisses the MC. And the MC just likes her as far as I remember. It's okay to surprise us with Sam's feelings, but we should be surprised in the same way your MC is surprised.

I only read through twice and am relying on memory, hopefully it's accurate. Good luck!
