  which Luna may have witnessed in person. If that's true, she was experimenting in front of her pre-teen daughter, which is incredibly reckless.

Luna has witnessed her mum's death, not necessarily the experimentation. Imagine some kind of explosion and little Luna comes running into the forbidden experimentation cellar to find her dying mom. Or no kind of explosion and Luna decides to check on mummy because it's past lunch.

Also I find your stance in regards to experimentation a little ignorant: Having less safety standards doesn't mean you're stupid. Lots of very smart people died in research simply because the dangers of certain things weren't known yet (I think of radiation or pathogens here). You have the advantage of standing on the shoulders of giants armed with all the knowledge from the past about what could go wrong, exactly because people died or received horrible injuries. "Don't touch the warm rock without safety equipment because you will get irradiated and get cancer" isn't exactly self-evident if you don't really know what alpha/beta/gamma radiations are and what they do.

I see no strong indication that Pandora was aware of the danger of what she was doing or that she was reckless.
