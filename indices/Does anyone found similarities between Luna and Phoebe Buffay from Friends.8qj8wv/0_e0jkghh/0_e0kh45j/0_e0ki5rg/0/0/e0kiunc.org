Luna described that her mother was quite bright but loved to experiment with spells. Between 1990 and 1991, one of them went wrong in a “horrible” manner, which Luna may have witnessed in person. If that's true, she was experimenting in front of her pre-teen daughter, which is incredibly reckless.

Now that I think about it, I'm not sure about something. Does a person need to actually see someone die in person to “understand death” or simply understand what it means for a person that was alive is gone? That raises some questions.
