That Mrs Lovegood was experimenting with spells or something, and it went wrong for some reason. It sounds from Luna's description (which is admittedly questionable) that she liked to test boundaries and wasn't cautious enough. It sounds like something that was rather common.

While I'm not involved in “magic,” I do work heavily in research and experimental work. The description sounds like what I see/hear about often where researchers did not follow safety guidelines at all or ignored them. Eventually this leads to a problems, sometimes even graphically fatal ones.
