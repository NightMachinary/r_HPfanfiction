yes. its hard to remember how much of luna is canon and how much is fanon. But from what I remember, both of their humor is drawn from their more casual perspective on events that others would find more sensitive or taboo. Also, the arguments between phoebe and ross (such as on evolution), are similar to Luna and hermione arguments.
