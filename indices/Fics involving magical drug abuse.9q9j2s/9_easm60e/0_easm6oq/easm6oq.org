  Hermione Granger is a mess, everyone can see it. She hasn't been sober in over a year, she's cut ties with her best friends and she spends her nights partying with Blaise Zabini and his crowd of rich, ex-Slytherin cronies. She finds herself on the cover of Witch Weekly on a regular basis, in more and more compromising situations, and rarely remembers the night before. All in all, she's an absolute wreck.Draco Malfoy has spent the two years since leaving Hogwarts travelling the world, studying Muggle and Magical healing and finding himself. Upon returning to England, they find themselves crossing paths more and more often. Draco finds himself becoming more and more fascinated with this new version of Hermione Granger, and increasingly concerned that she might never be the same again. What happened to send her into such a horrific spiral? What could be so awful that she's willing to kill herself to forget? Watching from below as she stands on the precipice of an impossible fall, will he be able to catch her before she reaches the bottom of her rabbit hole?
