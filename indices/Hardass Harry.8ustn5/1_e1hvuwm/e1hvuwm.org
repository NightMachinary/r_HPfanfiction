- Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge): Harry receives unexpected assistance that compels him to get his act together
- Taking Control linkffn(Taking Control): /the/ indy!Harry fic, but he definitely works for it when it comes to improvement and fixing his failures
- Magicks of the Arcane linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane): I have some problems with this fic, especially in the first five chapters, but by about 1/3 to 1/2 of the way through Harry is determined to fight in the war and bring it to an end. This is to such a degree that at one point he gets in a standoff with Dumbledore about not trying to reform or spare Voldemort like he did with Grindelwald.
- The Hero Trilogy linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero): Harry refuses to sit by and watch people die while he flounders about. Possibly one of the most OP Harry stories by the end, but ironically also the most OP Voldemort as well.
- The Unforgiving Minute linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute): possibly the closest to a "greater good" Harry I have encountered, he time-traveled back to 1995 to speedrun Voldemort and the Death Eaters in the most brutal manners possible. Dragons, dementors, undead worms, aurors; nothing stops him.
