In a word, yes. Sword of the Hero ramps up as it goes, but it maintains a dark tone during the whole affair. Which is /utterly/ brutal here (I won't spoil it, but its enough to scar my memories). It gets even better in the next book, as the series takes a major shift. Defiance is probably the peak of the series, but Soul is easily one of the most meta!Harry fics I can remember.

Honestly, you will probably have more trouble with the 3rd book than the 1st.
