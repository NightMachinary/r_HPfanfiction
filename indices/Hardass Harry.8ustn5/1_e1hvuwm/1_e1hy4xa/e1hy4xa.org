Thanks for the recommendations! I've read the unforgiving minute, taking control, and magicks of the arcane. I loved them all (not so much taking control because of the cliches, but it's still good).

I'll look at unlocked knowledge and i'm currently reading the Sword of the Hero.

I'm a little bit into Sword of the Hero and i'm not really hooked. When Harry was fighting the death eaters on brooms it was good, but then afterwards you get slammed with this DepressedHarry! PoorMeHarry! It'sAllMyFaultHarry! I just want to punch him more than anything.

I'm familiar with Joe's Wastelands of Time and i know he's a truly epic writer, so is it worth pushing through this part and reading the trilogy? Does it have action, mystery and awesome magic like WOT?

Thanks a bunch!
