I've read a few of these of varying quality, but I'm going to need a little more detail before I am able to figure out which one you're talking about. Do you remember anything else about the story? Who was in his "harem"? Do you remember who the "primary wife" was? Was the plot driven by the inheritance or was it just a side-show to whatever else Harry has to do to defeat Voldemort?
