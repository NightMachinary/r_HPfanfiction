Albus and Harry's World Trip linkffn(13388022)

Harry gets expelled after the Chamber of Secrets. So Dumbledore offers his services as a private tutor for the low cost of 1 knut a year (he actually hasn't directly taught in years you see, there should be a discount).

  Albus knocked on the door of the building and spoke in Gobbledegook to the goblin who answered the door.

  Harry bowed. "Thank you for welcoming me to..." and then faithfully repeated the Gobbledegook phrase he had been taught by Albus.

  The goblin looked at Harry for a moment, then looked up at Albus whose eyes were sparkling with joy. When he spoke to Harry, it was in clear English. "Can you repeat that?"

  Harry frowned and concentrated. He repeated the phrase precisely, then spoke in an uncertain voice. "That is how you pronounce the name of the village, isn't it?"

  The goblin looked back up at Albus and rolled his eyes. "The name of the village is Dewbrook. What you just said was 'Goblins are Awesome'. To be fair, we are awesome. Come on in."

  Harry looked up at Albus in shock. "I thought you wanted to build my trust."

  Albus's eyes sparkled with blatant mirth. "Pranks don't count. Come on, let's make you a fortune."
