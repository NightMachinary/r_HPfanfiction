That would still mean she hasn't been a duelist for 25 years or whatever age Bill is. It makes little sense that Molly beat Bellatrix. If JKR had played Molly up as being badass with a wand and we just didn't get to see it that would be fine, but I think the only mention of Molly being particularly good at magic was that she was invited to the Slug Club. That might be fanon though I can't remember.
