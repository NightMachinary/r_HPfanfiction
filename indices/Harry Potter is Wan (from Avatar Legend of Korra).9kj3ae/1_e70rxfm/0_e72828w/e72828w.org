It's more the character/personality of Harry. Also, Wan is kind of similar to Harry - they see a problem, try to solve it only to get into a lot of trouble, and stumble head first into a situation they have no business being anywhere near. Also, it would make sense that the only person capable of bending all four elements would be someone built for magic. I'm thinking he won't have magic simply because the Avatar world wouldn't have magic the way Harry's world does, like magic as an element would not exist.
