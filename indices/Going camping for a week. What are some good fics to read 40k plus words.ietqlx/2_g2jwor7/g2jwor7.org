So many I recommend that you've probably read... so I'll avoid the ones that seem to always come up. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the ashes of chaos) This is an ongoing story. Probably my favourite ongoing story at the moment. A bit trope heavy, but it makes good on them or seems to try and outright subvert them. Or at least, it's setting up to do so.
