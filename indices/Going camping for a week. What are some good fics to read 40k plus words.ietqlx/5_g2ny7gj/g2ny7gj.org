linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) is up to book 4 and over a million words thus far. Crossover with Alanna the Lioness, but a lot of the story is original, with rich worldbuilding and very interesting challenges for the protagonist as she navigates through a world where Riddle is less violent and yet more dangerous than ever. (And Alanna herself might have ended her masquerade at the end of book 1, without significant consequences, but Harriet Potter doesn't have that luxury; if caught, she'd spend the rest of her life in Azkaban, assuming that she survived to get there.)
