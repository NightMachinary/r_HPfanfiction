Deprived is a Harry/Fleur fic along those lines. Harry runs away because he is neglected in favor of his twin who is the boy who lived. He returns to Hogwarts as Fleur's bodyguard during the TriWizard tournament. It's pretty angsty but Harry is very powerful. He has a knight that his the embodiment of his hatred that follows him. Unfortunately it's incomplete but fits your request pretty well.
