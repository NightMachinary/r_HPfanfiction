Seconding HG:BWL.

McPherson... Well, I've just given /Child of Light/ a try. While not quite /bad/, it feels a bit unfocused and has pacing issues. The author inserted a large number of other divergences and too many extraneous characters to no clear purpose. (What are Regulus and Sirius doing there?) It took 23 chapters, and Hermione's cohort are finally getting to Hogwarts. Take this comment as you will.
