[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6055799/Katie-Macpherson][Katie Macpherson]] is a new author who likes to write HP crossovers. Her stories are generally good, but she has to yet finish one novel-length fic.

Hermione is the main character in "Child of Light", linkffn(11052921), a HP/Avenger crossover, and "Wild Flower", linkffn(12229585), a HP/GoT crossover.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-26436/DianeCastle+The+League+of+Extraordinary+Women.htm][The League of Extraordinary Women]] is a multiple-crossover with an almost canon Hermione. The story itself is great, but has canon pairings. The author [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/AuthorStories-22082/DianeCastle.htm][DianeCastle]] is one of my top five, as she specializes in crossovers and excellent world-buildings. Many have recommended her [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] on this sub.
