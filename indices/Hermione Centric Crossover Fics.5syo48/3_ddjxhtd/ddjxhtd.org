Most are complete, only one or two Sherlock fics are not (but they're pretty recent, I hope they get updated eventually). These are the one I read and liked, I might have one or two more, but I can't remember them. I like the magic side with Hermione/Loki, and the intelligence/mind side in Hermione/Sherlock. In some of the Hermione is a bit OOC, but it's a crossover, who cares.

Oh, and EDIT : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11172605/1/Sum-of-Us]] Hermione/Sherlock, crime case, very good.
