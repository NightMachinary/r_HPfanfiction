I like this question! So I'll be honest that my interpretations on some of the magical species are pretty limited because I haven't thought about them as much as others, but here goes...

Werewolves: I agree with you that the alpha/beta/family system is a neat interpretation and am content to assume HP wolves have similar limitations to traditional werewolves.

Vampires: I always thought these were just so barely touched on that they could essentially be made into /almost/ whatever you wanted. Rowling's portrayal left them kind of mysterious at best and enigmatic with a touch of hungry mixed in.

Dragons: They strike me as very different from the old-school hoarding and intelligent creatures you find in Tolkien and other lore. I see them more as animalistic rather than intelligent because they're kept in herds, tightly controlled, and can be “trained” to respond to certain stimuli. I don't see them being open to a higher level of intelligence.

Goblins: As you were describing your interpretation of goblins, for some reason I was reminded of the historical view of Jews. I don't intend this to come off as rude, but some part of me wonders if Rowling took a look at how Jews were treated long ago in her design for goblins. Examples: Jews were relegated to limited roles in society for jobs (i.e. banking), were shunned for their so-called greed, were seen as less-than by many members of European societies. Goblins get much the same treatment by being the bankers of the world, shunned and excluded from the use of wands because it would give them more agency, and relegated to the lower class fields of wizarding society. It's just an interesting comparison to me.

Ghosts: I find ghosts fascinating because they tend to be tied to a location. I've often wondered about Nearly Headless Nick and his affiliation with Hogwarts. I understand the Headless Haunt can move to different locations, but in my interpretation, they would require a form of magical permission and be limited to being gone only for a certain time period. The implication that people become ghosts who are afraid to face death is interesting and makes me wonder about the ghostly characters of Hogwarts who have chosen to make those imprints so they aren't forced to the afterlife. Nearly Headless Nick discusses this briefly with Harry after Sirius's death, IIRC, and he mentions Sirius would not have made ties to the world to stay in ghost form. So I do wonder what those ties would look like. Any thoughts?

Portraits: I LOVE this one, probably because my first longform HP fic explores the world of charming portraits. I've got an entire theory of the work that goes into it, but I highly doubt any of my ideas relate to canon. I think of portraits as sentient and like the idea of having portraits in a “sleeping” position (or fixed/arrested motion) until the portrait's human counterpart has died. In addition I imagine that knowledge the human held can be added to the portrait periodically throughout his lifetime, so if a portrait were painted while a person was in his youth, that person could submit to having his memories magically added to his portrait over time. Thus we get a portrait of Dumbledore that has knowledge of things the human version would have been aware of even so close to his death. I imagine portrait charming as a very closely protected field in the wizarding world and think most people involved would go through apprenticeships to learn to carry on this tradition. But I also imagine there are people who have gone down dark paths of trying indecent things in charming portraits, which is where the fic I'm writing gets a lot of inspiration.

(For reference, the fic I'm writing has combined the HP world with The Picture of Dorian Gray, and that's where I got quite a bit of inspiration for my own headcanon!)
