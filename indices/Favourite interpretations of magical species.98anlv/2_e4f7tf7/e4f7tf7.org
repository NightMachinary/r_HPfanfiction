- Werewolves: I hate the whole Alpha/Beta hierarchy thing as its based on disproven theories regarding pack dynamics and is almost always an excuse for bad writing. My interpretation is that the Wolf Totem is cursed, spreading like a disease and driving those affected to madness. Lockheart is implied to have stolen a story of a wolf animagus driven to madness in a similar manner to a werewolf. The curse is also much more insidious than most people think, that's why Remus forgot to take is potion and why most people are rightly wary of them.

- Vampires: are an artificially created species that didn't really work out in Harry Potter. Lots of allergies, weakened magical power, longevity but not immorality, and the whole craving and/or needing blood thing. Hate the SoS as they were able to use their greater longevity more effectively to influence muggles before it was implemented.

- Dragons: are simply magical apex predictors. That power has probably always been valued so wizards who made use of them as gloried guard dogs. Stories of this eventually grew into tales of intelligent dragons hoarding gold and lusting after princesses.

- Goblins: are a mainly subterranean species which is why they've tolerated wizards as long as they have. Power and position is a big thing to goblins, and most are bullies or tricksters. Ironically thet have a highly regimented society to curb there excess. Goblins delight in petty cruelty against acceptable targets and maintain the majority of the slave trade in the magical Briton away from the eyes of wizards going after easy targets such as muggles and other non-humans. They would love to have a bigger piece of the pie but don't want to risk a major confrontation with wizards to they mostly keep to themselves underground, Gringotts is basically an embassy.

- Ghosts: are lingering souls capable of little more than sustaining themselves with what magic they had in life. Generally magic that can affect ghosts is by definition dark because it can harm souls or magic. The Killing Curse doesn't leave behind ghosts making it a choice murder spell.

Most humanoids in general were created by wizards. Some where recreations of myth, while others developed there own mythology over time. They are all innately magical, but do to the majority of their power being used to support their own existence most are relatively weak compared to wizards.
