- Werewolves: it seems paramount to me that in the Wizarding World it's /just/ a disease. It turns you into a murderous wolf once a month and that's /it/. /No/ mental side-effects when you're not a wolf. Greyback and his gang are just desperate nutters, no more rational about their "wolfish" behavior than weird cultist hippies who'd ramble about totem animals.

- Vampires: Something I feel very strongly about is that HP vampires should be a separate species like Goblins and Veelas, as opposed to cursed humans like werewolves. It seems to me like otherwise they'd stick out like a sore thumb in a world where only the very darkest of dark magic can /possibly/ allow you to be immortal. Beyond that, yeah, it looks like they have a pretty sophisticated culture.

- Dragons: I've seen attempts to reconcile sentient dragons with HP dragons, but I'm sorry, it just doesn't really work. That they be children cannot possibly be true since the one in the Triwizard Tournament is a mother. The only way it works that I've seen is the recent story /Fight for Rights/ where dragons used to be sentient and powerful but caused too much chaos and were put under an inherited curse that stunts their intelligence.

- Goblins: Not particularly different from wizards save culturally; you could adopt a goblin baby and raise him as a human, and once he was grown up you couldn't possibly tell he was a goblin from his behavior. I /will/ allow that the average Goblin I.Q. may be a bit larger than the human one, though. As for why they believe objects belong to their makers: interesting headcanon, but an important point to remember is that this belief is not a wide-spread dogma but an extremist, conservative belief, which not all Goblins subscribe to by far.

- Overall I think ghosts shouldn't be particularly different from living people except that they don't have physical urges and can't affect the material world. They definitely /should/ be able to learn stuff, though not with more accuracy than living people, meaning that after a hundred years their oldest memories as ghost will start to blur together, and very, very old ghosts couldn't tell you a thing about what they were doing a thousand years ago unless that was particularly remarkable.

- Paintings definitely can learn too in canon: how do you suppose the Fat Lady knows what she's supposed to be doing? I think of them as fully sentient beings, but they're canonically /not/ a perfect imprint of the person they were based on; their personality upon inception is only a realization of what the artist /thought/ the person was like. From there on the original model can teach the Portrait to be better like them, or transfer some of their memories through Pensieve. Portraits put much pride in mimicking their original-selves as well as possible when they have an "audience", but they are ultimately different people and they know that deep down (though it's considered taboo for a flesh-person to discuss the matter with a Portrait).
