I always look forward to your comments, they are really well thought out!

- I agree with you about werewolves, for some reason I forgot to write about the disease aspect and focused on what they were like when they are transformed. I think there must be some kind of subtle pull on them during the rest of the month, or Bill's appetite would not have changed.
- I agree about Vampires being a species rather than a curse. I think as a culture they are really very ancient, as the earliest recorded stories date back to 4000 BC (Sumer). I really like the word "Dhampir" for half-vampire, so I would like to think they can procreate with humans in a similar way to Veela.
- With Dragons, perhaps children was the wrong word. The specific idea I had in mind was the Japanese myth about objects gaining a soul after 100 years (I think). I thought maybe that dragons had to actually get to a certain age before their intelligence awoke, but it is incredibly rare for them to live this long due to hunting, squabbles over territory, and a spate of dragon hunting which led to Elder Dragons being made almost extinct (the origin of all the dragonslaying myths in mythology).
- Goblins: I think the way their minds work is a bit more than just cultural, I really like the idea of there being a dichotomy between a cool, analytical mind and a raging inferno of bloodlust when they lose their tempers. I thought the belief about makers owning their creations was common to all goblins, not an extremist belief - is this your headcanon or have I forgotten something from the HP books?
- Thanks for your ideas on ghosts, that makes me a lot more comfortable with them tbh. I think they should be able to retain their original memories, though. Not in perfect detail, but I think it's a really important part of who they are. What comes after is fair game, though.
- The paintings... make me uncomfortable XD I'm not sure how I feel about being able to create truly sapient objects. I thought that there might be methods to make a portrait more life-like, by transferring memories to the painting or through particularly detailed enchantment, but that it would still not be truly sapient in the way that people are. I do like to think that there is some essence of the original person, though, so I'm not sure what I think about the portrait knowingly acting as a person. Gah. The ethics of such objects makes me feel weird when thinking about how they work.
