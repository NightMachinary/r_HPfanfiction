  I really like the word "Dhampir" for half-vampire, so I would like to think they can procreate with humans in a similar way to Veela.

That's canon; there's a famous Wizarding rock-singer called Lorcan d'Eath who's Half-Vampire.

  I thought the belief about makers owning their creations was common to all goblins, not an extremist belief - is this your headcanon or have I forgotten something from the HP books?

It's canon. Perhaps I phrased this wrong; this is definitely how it works for everyone /in Goblin society/, but only a few extremist take it as a central commandment and try to apply it in their dealings with wizards.

The ethics /are/ a bit weird, but I don't see them as moreso than House-Elves. The Wizarding World is bad at treating nonhuman sentients well, end of story. Presumably once Minister Hermione has sorted out House-Elves and the other such very pressing issues, she gives more rights to the Portraits and gives them representatives. That sounds absolutely bonkers, yes, but that's precisely why it fits perfectly for the Wizarding World.

And it's canon that magic can create sapient beings willy-nilly whether or not you classify Portraits as such: cf. the Sorting Hat, Acromantulas.
