  And it's canon that magic can create sapient beings willy-nilly whether or not you classify Portraits as such: cf. the Sorting Hat, Acromantulas.

Wait what? Magic can't create life like that. I always thought of portraits and the Sorting Hat as sort of AI s, you know? Programmed to act a certain way (and maybe even learn) but not really sapient creatures.

What do Acrumantulas have to do with it? Am I forgetting something?
