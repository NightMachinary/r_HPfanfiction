It is never said that magic can't create life, whatever gave you that idea? Portraits' /personalities/ are kind of "one-dimensional" (as Rowling amusingly puts it), but that doesn't mean they're not /people/, and Rowling speaks of them as such. They fear for their own lives, as seen with the Fat Lady when she's attacked by Sirius, and mingle amongst themselves. The Sorting Hat has never been treated as anything but a /character/, either. Note how he spends his time composing the Sorting Songs: that's a shining example of original artistic creation from such a magical-AI (the fact that he doesn't sing very /well/ is neither here nor there).

As for Acromantulas, they didn't evolve naturally: they were created by wizards in Borneo to guard their treasures, but rebelled against their creators and went into the jungle to live as barbarians. So magic was, at the least, able to turn something as unfathomably dumb as a spider into a fully sentient, talking race.

You know, you may benefit from reading my story. It's kind of all about this type of thing.
