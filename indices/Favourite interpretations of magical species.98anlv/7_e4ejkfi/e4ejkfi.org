You know, I wonder; about the dragons who hoard gold in classical mythology; Fafnir, Beowulf's dragon, Fucanglong...Smaug and Eustace Scrubb, even...are those dragons that hoard gold natural? Or are they artificially created, or transformed from humans in some way?

That'd be an interesting take; 'normal' dragons that are somewhat unintelligent, lay eggs, have a normal lifespan, and 'monster' dragons, smart and powerful creatures created by dark lords or transformed from overly greedy witches/wizards. Maybe Harry, hungry for Golden Snitches and gold gobstone sets and gold cauldrons, inadvertently finds that when he tries to follow in his father's footsteps and become an animagus, his desire for wealth influences his form...
