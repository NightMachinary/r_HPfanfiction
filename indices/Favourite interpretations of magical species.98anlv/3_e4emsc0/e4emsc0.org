Oh, say, Another thing on dragons; I have seen a fic series which has them be intelligent; [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/205025][Island of Fire by esama]].

In that one, it's explained that with all of the useful things that can come from harvesting dragons (blood, hide, heartstrings, et-cetera et-cetera), it wouldn't do for them to be discovered as highly intelligent creatures. That and feeding a baby dragon brandy has about the same effect as feeding brandy to a human baby.
