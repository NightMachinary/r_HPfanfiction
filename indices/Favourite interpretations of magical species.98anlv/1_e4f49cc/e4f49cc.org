*Werewolves*

I like the approach that canon takes - it's a debilitating curse, and doesn't come with any special powers, its own society, etc. Not much more to say as they're pretty well covered in canon.

*Vampires*

My preferred interpretation of vampires is the classic one: aristocratic, lurking in the shadows, dangerous in a predatory/seductive rather than warrior-like way. I picture them as very rare because vampire-hunting is legal around the world, due to their needing to hunt humans to feed. As such I imagine there's no more than a handful of them left in Europe, but those who have survived are the craftiest, most dangerous ones.

As for their powers, I would stick with the original: undead and therefore ageless and invulnerable to most physical harm, plus powers of hypnosis and other mind magic. I'd have them stronger and faster than regular humans, but not superman levels, and the smart ones avoid fights. I would keep the original weaknesses too, except for the religious ones (religion doesn't fit well with HP). Crucially, they cannot use wands.

As with werewolves, I would have it so only wizards can be turned into vampires - Muggles just die.

*Goblins*

I view them as not only culturally different to wizards but also having significant biological differences which result in cognitive differences. In particular, I view goblins as being fundamentally more bloodthirsty and cruel than wizards.

I also imagine goblins as the most populous of magical beings after wizards.
