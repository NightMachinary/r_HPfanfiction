  Dragons: I like both JKR's interpretation and the tales of old, intelligent dragons hoarding gold. I thought that they could be reconciled perhaps; the dragons seen in canon are essentially children and have not developed the intelligence that elder dragons possess.

:o SteamycutieAngel! In my story, I reconciled the issue of muggle fairy tale sapient gold-hoarding dragons and modern "real magic" HP canon dragons, by actually making it so that it's like the Merlin and Philosopher's Stone myths being historical reality! :) I made it so that dragons of centuries ago actually /did/ used to be sapient, gold-hoarding and village burning chaos-bringers like in the fairy tales, but that the old wizarding societies got fed up with it and finally came together and placed a super powerful curse on the whole species - which also carried on through their children - that turned them all from sapient beings into the mere beasts they are in modern Harry Potter. :)
