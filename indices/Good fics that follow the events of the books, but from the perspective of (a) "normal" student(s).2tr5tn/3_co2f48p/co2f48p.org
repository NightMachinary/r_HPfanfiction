[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2581495/1/Blackwand_Chronicles][The Blackwand Cronicles]] is pretty cool, though abandoned pretty early on. Its not so much about Harry and his life, but its a group of kids who start at Hogwarts in Harry's third year, so he is busy dealing with godfathers and dementors in the background.
