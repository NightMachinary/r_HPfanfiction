'Hogwarts is an ancient castle. It is a powerful and strange school with many, many secrets buried inside, underneath and in-between its ancient walls. Some of these things are monsters. Others, cursed artifacts. Occasionally, you even get a shiny bauble of monstrous power. All of them are hidden behind closed-off doorways, trapped corridors, hidden teleporters and more. Is it any wonder that the muggleborn happen to notice the similarities between their favourite school and every dungeon-crawler ever?'
