Thunderstorm is the only one I know of, but it's a great one. I'd definitely like to read something along the lines of what you're describing, I was disappointed there was such a lack there after i stumbled on thunderstorm.

Personally, I think back in time is the better way to go: it separates Voldemort from being such a monster a bit; especially the whole â€˜hideous due to rituals' thing.
