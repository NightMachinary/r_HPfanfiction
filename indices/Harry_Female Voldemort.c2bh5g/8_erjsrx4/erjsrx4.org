I completely agree and I also want more. That said there is another story that I think you might enjoy, it isn't a fem Voldemort (it's fem harry) it isn't a romance, (At least not between harry and tom), but /feels/ similar. Also, it's just really damn good. It hasn't been updated in a while but I don't think it's abandoned.
