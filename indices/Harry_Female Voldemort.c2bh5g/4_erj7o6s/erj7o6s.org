YES!!! I loved Limpieza de Sangre and wanted more of Harry/Fem Voldemort but it's really hard to find good ones. To answer your questions:

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12934044/1/Cleansing-the-Sins-of-the-Past]] (sequel to Limpieza de Sangre), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13250880/1/The-Advantages-of-Being-Sane]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12927826/1/Power-is-Control]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13102306/1/Gaining-Power]] (sequel to Power is Control), and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7186430/1/Thunderstorm]]
2. I would definitely read 200k+ Harry/Fem Voldemort pairing :)
3. Anything you or any author is good for the story
4. I think Harry going back in time would make it easier for the author to write since there is the whole "Harry can change Fem Voldemort before she becomes evil" but doing to present day would give more interesting plot
