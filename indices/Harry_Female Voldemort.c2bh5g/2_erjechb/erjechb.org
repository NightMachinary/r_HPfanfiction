In addition to all the fics that were linked here (I love Power is Control and highly recommend it), there is also Descent.

!linkffn(10755261)

Descent is, unfortunately, abandoned, but it's notable for being a f!HP/f!TR, an ever rarer pairing.

Also, self-promotion time!

!linkffn(Departure from the Diary)

Departure from the Diary is a fic I made because I wanted to add something to the abysmal number of fics with this pairing. It's an experimental piece of writing for me (written in first person from a single character's perspective), so it's not my best work, but I'd like to think that it's worth a read. I plan on writing several scenes delving into Tamelyn's memories in the upcoming chapters.
