Molested as a child? While that's a plausible headcanon where on earth is that canon?

And speaking of canon non-canon things, I'm preeetty sure Ted and Andromeda took measures to hide themselves. If Bellatrix could have found them (as per canon) she would. Then there's the psychology of a Bellatrix, who eats her food when she's done playing with it if she's not trying to get it to tell her where her +crush+ master is.
