Personally, I try to find large stories to read. Fanfiction is a hobby that I pursue when I'm taking a break from work or, as most of you are probably familiar with, going to the bathroom. So "How long can I expect to read this story before I have to bother finding another good one to read" is a huge factor for me. It's /probably/ a factor for other people, too, so a large word count could draw people.

Alternatively, if you're writing a very long story, take the time to polish your earlier chapters as you write and, consequently, get better at it. If I'm reading a 250k word story, I use those first couple chapters that I read to kind of gauge what to expect for the rest of it. No one wants to read 250k words of bad grammar or "ramble writing". If your writing gets /really good/ later, I might miss that entirely because I skipped out early. No matter how good the premise is, a person can only take so much.

It's not really a hassle for me to find the sequel on the Author's page. If I'm sinking, say, 20 hours into reading a story that's 250k words long, a 5 second detour and two clicks isn't likely to matter much.

If you /do/ split it up, though, I'd recommend writing both the last chapter of a prequel and the first chapter of the sequel at the same time. No one likes getting emails for advertisements or clicking "Next Chapter" only to find out that there isn't any more to actually read. If you write them at the same time, you can just add the note at the end of that last chapter that a sequel is available.

Again, this is just my opinion on a number of factors. I'm sure that are people who could disagree with every single point I've made, but until I'm proven wrong, I'll assume that my opinion is the average.
