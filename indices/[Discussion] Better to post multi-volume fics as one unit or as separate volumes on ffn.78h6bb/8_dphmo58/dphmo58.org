Personally the longer the better! I'm a binge reader and have been known to read the first 2 books in the outlander series in a weekend (no clue how many words, just know they're big)

I love that on archive of our own there is the linked stories facility, but I will always check that all of the stories are complete before starting, as I once got really into a series that the last book wasn't yet completed and it completely bummed me out. But as ffn doesn't have that functionality, one big volume works best for me.

Though once I've read a fic that I really enjoy, I will always go and check out the author page for more stories and binge my way through them all.
