I've always been a fan of telling the story in one “story”. If “book 2” starts a few days or weeks after the end of “book 1” and simply continues an existing story line with a small time skip, it should just be appended to the original. There's no real need to arbitrarily split a story over “books” unless you're dead-set on mimicking the feel of the canon heptology.

That said, if your book 1 concludes the story and you want to continue a new story with the same characters, then by all means start a new “book”.
