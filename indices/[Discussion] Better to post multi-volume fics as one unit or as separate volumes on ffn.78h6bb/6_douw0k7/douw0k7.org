Personally I like splitting the Volumes/Books up. One it reduces the fear of seeing 98 chapters and 2.1 million words and trying to find my place if I lost it a while back.

Splitting volumes also makes rereading entire stories easier as I personally can slam through about 80k words a night cutting through a volume in 2 days and be content knowing I got 2/3 chapters left rather than 40.

Plus new stories allow for changes in narrative feel and tone. Year one is light and easy, Year two being mildly darker but still joyous, year three significantly darker than the previous two, year three being a mirror of year 2 as things get easier and we have more adventures but we also have the Goblet plot hanging over. Even with OC stories it's better to split them after a while as thing become far more serious or lighter.
