Depends how long you're gonna make it. What I'm writing will likely reach over a million words, so I'll be splitting it up.

But that's just me. I've read series that go over a million words, but to be honest, if I saw the word count of the story as a million instead of like 250k words, I'd probably have skipped it. Something about it being split up makes it easier for me to want to dive in, you know?

Like if you gave me one book that consisted of the entirety of A Song of Ice and Fire, I'd probably not bother.

You might lose a few readers, I suppose, if you split it up, but anyone who's actually interested in the story won't have a problem going to your profile and finding the sequel.

If you split it up, make it clear in the summaries which part is which.
