It really depends, when it´s written by an author that, has a good track record for finishing their fics and updates regularly, I don´t mind if the stories are split up, because I´m sure the story will be finished someday, but it really annoys me when I stumble on a complete fic, only to find out that the sequel hasn´t been updated for two years, if it´s all in one volume I at least know if I get a full story or not.
