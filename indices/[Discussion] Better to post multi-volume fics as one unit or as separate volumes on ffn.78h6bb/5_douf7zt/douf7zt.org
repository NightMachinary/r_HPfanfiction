Really, if you're looking for exposure, it's better to release a chapter every 2 days or so, or maybe a bit faster than that. If you're looking to just post a story, if it essentially amounts to one continuous, developing plot, then a single unit is best. If it's many distinct plots, as in actual "books", it's better to separate them out into their separate books.

Edit: thought you were asking about how often to post chapters of a completed fix, my bad.
