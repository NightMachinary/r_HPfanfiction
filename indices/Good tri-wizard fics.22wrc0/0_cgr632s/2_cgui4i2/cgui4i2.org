I never heard of temporal beacon so I have read since you have posted this. I have to to disagree I really had trouble getting through the first part of the fic, it was really hard to get over the stupid/badly done Ron bashing. The interesting stuff happened when stuff get going in the latter stuff. a lot Peggy sue stories have trouble understanding cause & effect and randomness.
