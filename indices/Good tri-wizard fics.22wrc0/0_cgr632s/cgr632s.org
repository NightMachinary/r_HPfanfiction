Off the top of my head the two fics that come to mind are The Lie I've Lived by jbern and Temporal Beacon. TLIL is an all time classic as far as I'm concerned and has much more interesting tasks. Temporal Beacon is a time loop fic that goes through the tournament a few times. I really enjoyed the early chapters of TB but personally I think it went a but off the rails eventually.
