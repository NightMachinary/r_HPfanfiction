Hi. I'm sorry for the confusion---it /was/ intended to reference the trope article, not a story with that name. I.e. in /the Temporal Beacon/ tournament tasks get changed on each iteration because each time they are “reloading” the world, something they change manages to influence how the tournament is going to turn out in the span of the ~4 months (their checkpoint is at the end of June).
