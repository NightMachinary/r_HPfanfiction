I personally really liked it.

I've just looked what the first 10 or so pages are, and---yeah... the first chapter is generic intro material while the 2nd starts with silly “humorous” situation about accidental innuendos and such. But IIRC it gets back on the rails and generally keeps good pacing all the way afterwards right after that bad mini-scene (in my version it starts with “there's one more thing I want to ask of you”).

/(some spoilers follow)/

Depending on your preferences, you may also not like that the story has some Ron bashing and doesn't include him in the adventures, and that Dumbledore's version in the story is of a manipulative flavour.

The key concept itself is that they make a time machine in the chamber of secrets based on Hermione's research project (she decides to not waste her opportunity with the time turner under her temporal possession), and by activating it they get a chance of returning to that point in timeline from anywhere in the future---provided that they “die” in the appropriate manner (so far, certain rune tablets should be activated or certain rune sets should be carved on their bodies).
