I COULD do a familiar plot. Keep the gender-bent Harry, but instead of Mehrunes Dagon, it could be Molag Bal. I already have a similar plot on Wattpad, but since Molag Bal is one of my favorite Daedric Princes, and becoming a Daughter of Coldharbour isn't a fanfiction idea that I find anywhere, I could write one on Webnovel. What do you guys think?
