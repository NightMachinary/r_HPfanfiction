I don't know a lot about ESO and the very early periods of the ES timeline, so I can't really comment on the Ayleids and stuff.

However, my advice would be to perhaps limit the crossover to two fandoms. There's nothing really wrong with adding more fandoms. But the less you use, the easier it tends to be on most readers (less fandoms to know about). For HP x ES, perhaps keep it that way.

There's a lot you can do between HP and Elder Scrolls, though I think having the plot take place within ES's setting works better for freedom of writing.

Also, you should consider cross-posting to AO3 and FFnet.
