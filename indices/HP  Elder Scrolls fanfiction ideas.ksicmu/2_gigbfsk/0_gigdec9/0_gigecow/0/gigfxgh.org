Thing is, I also love RWBY, and Cinder is my favorite antagonist aside from Salem, so if I make a Pyromancer/Fire Elemental female Harry, I gotta go with molding her after Cinder, but not to the point where it's blatantly obvious... or, at least I try not to make it obvious. But I've also thought about that particular crossover (HP/RWBY), where fem! Harry is Cinder (I've only read one where that happens, and I was left frustrated afterwards). I was writing my HP/ES crossover, and realized that I may have made her too much like Cinder, then thought about just making it that way.

It would be something I know Cinder would actually do if she ever learned of Daedric Princes... especially one that represents Ambition, and Destruction.

So, yeah. I just had that thought. It would be unique to have more than just two stories as a crossover, but I was just going to leave this one at three... depending on how well the idea is liked.
