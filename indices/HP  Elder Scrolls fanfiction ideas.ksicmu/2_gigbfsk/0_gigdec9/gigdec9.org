It's an interesting thought. I have one Harry Potter/Elder Scrolls fanfiction on Webnovel where Harry's an Ayleid, and is the last descendant of King Laloriaran Dynar. Meridia also shows up and makes him immortal via making him into a Purified. Gotta admit, ESO has some very interesting things I didn't know about in ES Lore previously.

But I had one particular idea in preparation for the Gates of Oblivion chapter that's coming out for ESO this year. It was a female Harry Potter idea in which she meets Mehrunes Dagon, but I think I made her too much like Cinder Fall from RWBY, and thus started thinking if I could somehow still make that work by making it into a Harry Potter/Elder Scrolls/RWBY crossover, and make her actually BE Cinder Fall, but more competent, more cunning, and more powerful than she actually is in the RWBY series. I wouldn't know how to go about that though.
