Perhaps you could make Voldemort and the Death Eaters come across Ulfric and the Stormcloaks, and then both sides see the similarities and flaws in the other. Perhaps they'd temporarily join up and then betray each other down the line.

Perhaps you could make the Ministry of Magic meet the Imperial Legion (Skyrim era), and see how they interact with each other.

You could make Harry himself end up in the Elder Scrolls world, which means he'd have to adapt to the 'high fantasy' setting vs the 'low fantasy' of JKR's world. There's no Statute of Secrecy, magic goes way beyond needing to be fine-tuned with wands (how would Harry's wand rank among the Elder Scrolls's instruments, such as staves, etc.?), ES not being set in a 'realistic' setting like HP, etc.

Or you could do the reverse and have the Elder Scrolls characters cross over into HP's world, but then you run the risk of limited freedom while having to deal with the 'realistic' setting + Muggle stuff. Or you could merge the two worlds and make all hell/Oblivion let loose. But, again, that means you'll have to deal with the broader Muggle stuff.

You could make Harry, Hermione, Draco, or whoever else somehow end up in the ES setting. I can totally see Hermione going all S.P.E.W.-style on the fact that slavery still exists in the ES world, particularly in places like Morrowind. Or, lol, Draco starts making fun of the elves (because he had Dobby as a servant) only to end up running into one, especially the Thalmor.

You could make Harry cross over as the often-used 'Master of Death' title in fanon, which would be interesting. In ES, necromancy is very much prevalent, while resurrection is not an impossibility like in Harry's world. So how special would MoD Harry actually be with all of his fanon OP powers?

Perhaps Harry could meet the Daedric Princes and end up having to navigate between them and their values.

For example, how would Meridia react to Harry having once 'conquered' death, seeing as Meridia despises the undead (would she classify Harry as being one?).

How would madlad Sheogorath react to Harry? Would he not care about the whole crossover thing and just go on as usual? Harry gets treated like any mortal person from Mundus and has to deal with the fact that he's not really that special here.

What about Molag Bal, the King of Rape? Depending on whether or not you're writing evil!Harry, perhaps Harry would avoid Molag like the plague. Fenrir Greyback, on the other hand (given what it's implied he does in canon), would probably gladly alternate between Hircine and Molag Bal.

Hell, perhaps you could make a crossover before the end of book seven, meaning that Harry gets promptly ripped away from his own setting and plot and has to deal with whatever's happening in the ES setting before going home. Depending on whether or not you have Harry age or the HP timeline freeze during his absence, Harry's return would be interesting in different ways.

What would Harry's race even be? The ES folk would probably be scratching their heads wondering if Harry ought to be classified as Nord, Imperial, Breton ... or just some alien from another dimension.
