LMAO! I hate it when that happens to me in Morrowind! Especially when I'm escorting that slave girl that's pretending to be a Telvanni. I wished I could fast travel with her just to save me all of that unnecessary pain. As much as I love Morrowind, it got on my nerves quite a bit, but I persevered, and beat the main questline, Bloodmoon (as a Werewolf, and getting the Spear of the Hunter), and Tribunal. Never did complete the Mages Guild, Fighter's Guild, the Morag Tong, Thieves Guild, or any of the House quests (i.e. Telvanni, Redoran, Hlaalu).
