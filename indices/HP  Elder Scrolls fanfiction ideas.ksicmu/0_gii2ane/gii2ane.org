Idk how full of a crossover it'd really turn out to be, but perhaps throw in a twist right at the end of book seven. Harry has his climactic showdown with Voldemort and emerges on top. The monster that has haunted him before he was even born is finally gone for good. But then an even as his foe's body is still crumbling to ash unwordly voice booms out for all present to hear: "With this character's death, the thread of prophecy is severed. Restore a saved game to restore the weave of fate, or persist in the doomed world you have created".
