Well, I've just decided to rewrite Chapter 2 of my fanfiction on Webnovel that's titled "Harry Potter and the Return of the Wild Elves". In this story, Harry is the last king of the Ayleids, and is the descendant of King Laloriaran Dynar. In this story, Harry will be claiming the throne of Delodiil, the City of Light that once worshipped Meridia. Meridia is also taking an active roll in helping Harry along his path to destroy all evil from both Earth and Nirn.
