These three are very similar fics, though I'd argue Whiskey Time Travel is the best of the three. Basically, angsty, powerful, casually-alcoholic Harry is an Unspeakable who fights things. Whiskey also has time-travel in the mix (obviously).

In this one, Luna is an unspeakable and it's quite interesting. It actually has the Unspeakables as magical researchers and not James Bond/Jason Bourne types for once.
