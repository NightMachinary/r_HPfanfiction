Thus far I've been enjoying the worldbuilding in the very AU fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12957404/1/Subversion][Subversion]] by Myricle. The story delves far into the Mind Arts in a way that's different from anything else I've seen in the Harry Potter fandom. It's also got some fascinating (and creepy) worldbuilding about ancient magic practiced pre-Statute, long before wands were made.

Overall, this fic shines for me because it features a Voldemort who is legitimately terrifying, and the 'good guys' are correspondingly more competent to balance the plot.
