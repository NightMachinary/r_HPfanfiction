I have never written before but I decided I wanted to give it a go. I have something like this currently in the planning stage with the first chapter currently written but not yet finalised (I posted it at one point then realised I didn't like it and took it down). I plan to add a lot more magically significant areas of Britain, focusing on different periods in history, for example druidic (like stonehenge) or the dark ages (the legends of King Arthur and Merlin).

The basic premise of the story is going to be about Harry continuing the DA into 6th year and converting it into a fighting force. It takes inspiration from Starfox5's linkffn(Divided and Entwined) but it will be different to that muggleborn resistance.

Currently I have a list of characters that will be in this continued DA and a general overview of each of them and their skills, and a few other details about the magical world which I'm going to change or add depth to.

Only problem is, as I have never written before, it's very difficult to know what sounds good while I'm writing it. This means writing takes a very long time, if I want it to be anything like decent.

If anyone has any ideas that might be useful and go with the very basic overview I've given, I'd be greatly appreciative.
