These fics are for the most part massively AU. I'm not sure that is exaclty what you're looking for, but the worldbuilding in all of these is stellar.

NMB is one of the best in the genre at worldbuilding.

Linkffn(The Skitterleap by enembee)

Linkffn(By The Divining Light by enembee)

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forest of Valbone by enembee)

Linkffn(Shadow of the Serpent by KEDme) - Little known older fic that probably hasn't aged very well, but I loved it. You don't need to read the prequel.

Linkffn(An Unfound Door by joe6991) - Joe is better known for his Wastelands of Time series, but this fic is even higher quality and the worldbuilding is great. It's a familiar setting, but has a ton of new elements.

Linkffn(Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian) - Another popular one, but SD builds a strange back and bleak world. The prologue is remarkable, but at 30k words is a bit of a slog through greasy brutality. One of my favorite fics.
