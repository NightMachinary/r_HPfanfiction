I really like Starfox5's stories for their worldbuilding, it's the same worldbuilding shared between most of the stories so each story expands upon the others.

Examples:

-Jamaica ruled by houngans that use Voodoo magic and zombies.

-France being a monarchy ruled by the Duc.

-The magical Ottoman empire is still a thing, and it still supports piracy and slavery even though everyone else dislikes that. But hey, how else will the rich elite fill their harems? Breaking kidnapped girls out of those happens in multiple stories, including Patron, Atlantis and Water.

-Magical Germany isn't united and consists of Prussia and multiple smaller states.

-Obliviators use Seers to get to events the moment they happen.

-America isn't united and the various enclaves fight each other quite a bit. Being from Quebec and moving to Britain because of the recent war at home is a common fake identity for spies.

-Fiendfyre is green for some reason. Â¯\/ðŸ™„//Â¯

Linkffn(Prologue to a Revolution) is a good start.
