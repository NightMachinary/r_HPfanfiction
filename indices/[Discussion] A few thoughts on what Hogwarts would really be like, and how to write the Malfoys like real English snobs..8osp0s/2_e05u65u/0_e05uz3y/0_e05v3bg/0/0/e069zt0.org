Harry's year is probably undersized.

There would be people who chose not to have children in the worst of a war. There would be people who emigrated to escape it, so their children who WOULD have been Hogwarts students are now at other schools abroad. Very likely there were pregnant witches who died.

I'm surprised Ginny's year and the year below her isn't huge, too. Post war celebratory baby boom.
