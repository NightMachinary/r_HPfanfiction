Would the teachers actually read the list each lesson? Because in my school time they usually did it once (first lesson) and only did headcounts afterwards. I found it annoying because it took me weeks to get all names right. Most people don't participate in lessons and not all teachers force participation or rotating assignment partners.

And given the capabilities of magical healing, there would be very few people missing classes for medical reasons.
