Isn't that contradicting herself because she published that list as "Harry's clasd list" and not a part of it? Also, that's bullshit because canon never as much as indicates that there are more Gryffindors?

And doesn't the rather illogical "equal numbers" rule make it statistically "impossible" for everyone to get an invite because that implies that there is an equal number of witches and wizards born each year and that those numbers have to be dividable by 4? Once or twice maybe, but for centuries? I mean, the probability for just one year is 1/16. And it gets really low really fast.

Honestly, the longer we look at this the more holes we find.
