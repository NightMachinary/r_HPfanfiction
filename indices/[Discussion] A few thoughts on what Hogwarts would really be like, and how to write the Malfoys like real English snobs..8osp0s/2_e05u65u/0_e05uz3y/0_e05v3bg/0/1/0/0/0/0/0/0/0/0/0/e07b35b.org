I think the only subject which would have manpower issues is Astronomy (or NEWT classes are after midnight). The electives can be fitted very easily (1 day for each year with just electives, you can choose 4 without needing a time turner). And the core classes can be slotted with relative ease as long as you use double lesson blocks like with electives.

And if you always hang out with the same people, you might not get to know more than ten people in three or four years (although you would know their names). And due to Voldemort and Sirius, Harry had more pressing matters than socializing for most of his Hogwarts time. Although I'm curious, are there any situations where Harry doesn't recognize another student from his year?
