Magic folk live beyond 100, with some far exceeding that. Dippet (the previous headmaster) lived to 300, and Dumbledore was quite spry in his 130's. Those are the only two that come to mind immediately, but I can very much believe slower aging. Also, keep in mind that Harry's generation would have been born at the tail-end of the "first war", and so you're going to deal with families being killed, or simply choosing not to have children in such a dangerous time. It's never been made clear the size of the classes after Harry and Co's. I imagine that being born after the end of a conflict would result in a "Baby boomers" generation.
