She never really published it until this [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-original-forty][Pottermore article]] , what we knew about it before were from a video were they glossed over it.

Rowling once mentioned that she doesn't really think in terms of numbers and what they mean overall. She basically created 40 students so she can just pick someone if she need a character form Harrys year and doesn't have to create someone new. She even said that she didnt even thought about where the other kids would be sleepning.

  Well, Hogwarts. All right. Here is the thing with Hogwarts. Way before I finished “Philosopher's Stone,” when I was just amassing stuff for seven years, between having the idea and publishing the book, I sat down and I created 40 kids who enter Harry's year. I'm delighted I did it, [because] it was so useful. I got 40 pretty fleshed out characters. I never have to stop and invent someone. I know who's in the year, I know who's in which house, I know what their parentage is, and I have a few personal details on all of them. So there were 40. I never consciously thought, “That's it, that' s all the people in his year,” but that's kind of how it's worked out. Then I've been asked a few times how many people and because numbers are not my strong point, one part of my brain knew 40, and another part of my brain said, “Oh, about 600 sounds right.” Then people started working it out and saying, "Where are the other kids sleeping?" [Laughter.]

But honestly it makes sense for Harry year to have more then 40 students for the simple reason that he doesn't even know the names of some until sixth year(which would be impossible in a boarding schools with only 40 people in your year) Or just the size of the magical world in general.

I personally like to think of there being around a hundred and twenty students on average every year. That would give give Hogwarts 800-850 students and magical britian in general around 12.000 wizards and witches, numbers I think roughly make sense. The other students would simply have their classes with others at the same time. I'd handwave the extra professors that would be needed, because they would even be needed with the canon number of students.
