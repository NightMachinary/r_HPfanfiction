There are two main problems with this.

Firstly, Hogwarts isn't a public school (in the British sense). Rather, it is a public school (in the American sense), i.e. you don't pay fees.

And even if it were a fee-paying school, there are good reasons to think that it wouldn't share a culture with British public schools. The biggest is that literally every magical child in the UK gets invited, so it's not selective nor is it inhabited by a certain class.

Secondly, Hogwarts exists within the wizarding world, not the Muggle world. So Muggle cultural norms wouldn't really apply, especially ones which post-date the statute of secrecy.
