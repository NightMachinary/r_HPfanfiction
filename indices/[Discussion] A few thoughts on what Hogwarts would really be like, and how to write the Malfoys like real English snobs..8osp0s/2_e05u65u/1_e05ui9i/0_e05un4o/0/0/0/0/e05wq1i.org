One thing that you haven't mentioned but I think is actually a big factor is the fact that the public schools being referenced are all-boys' schools. That has a huge impact - in my experience, single-sex schools develop a much more insular culture with a lot more idiosyncrasies than co-educational schools do.

I have attended an all-boys school and lived in an all-girls school (parents were teachers) and in both cases the schools had much stronger and unique culture compared to the coeducational boarding school I attended -- even though the co-ed one was by far the oldest.
