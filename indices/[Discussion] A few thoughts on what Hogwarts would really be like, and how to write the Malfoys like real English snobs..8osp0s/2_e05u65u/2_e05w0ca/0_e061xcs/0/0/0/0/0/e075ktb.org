You could use that to describe public schools. They aren't elite because they cater to everyone in that society - upper class - and even take in some kids beyond that.

Saying ‘we'll take anyone who pays the fee, and even some who can't who win a scholarship', or ‘we'll take anyone who will attend the school organised faith services etc' is no less elite than saying ‘we'll take anyone who can do magic'. If anything more people are envious of going to Hogwarts than a public school.
