  Music in deaf communities is a big area of study, and stopping deaf students studying that would break the equalities act big time.

Granted, but they couldn't possibly learn about /in the same way/, and with the same lessons and teachers, as people with hearing. A school that teaches magical lore to nonmagicals would be imaginable in a Statute-free world, but it would not be Hogwarts. I mean, you could technically make it a division of Hogwarts, but it wouldn't be the /same school/ in a real sense.

  A school that also teaches magic. Maybe Harry and his friends would have learned some maths too.

But that would make it into a completely different establishment. Hogwarts is /not/ a general-purpose school, it's a school of magic. This is like trying to reform an art school by making it into a general school that happens to offer art as a class; both have merits but they're fundamentally different things.

Also, yet another argument: Muggles /are not citizens of the Wizarding World/. Quite a few schools around the world don't normally allow people who aren't citizen of the country they're in.
