  You don't teach musicology to people who were born deaf, and there's nothing discriminatory to that

Actually, that's illegally discriminatory in the UK. Music in deaf communities is a big area of study, and stopping deaf students studying that would break the equalities act big time.

  What do you propose a non-elitist school of magic would look like?
#+end_quote

A school that /also/ teaches magic. Maybe Harry and his friends would have learned some maths too.

  Muggles physically could not, in any event, complete the curriculum.

And kids with learning difficulties who can't complete the curriculum in the U.K. can't be legally discriminated against either.

Hogwarts is great, but it has no moral high ground over public schools because it's even more selective about its pupils and less open to access.
