No, I'm not at all. You're claiming there some special definition that makes the difference between wizards and muggles somehow larger than class boundaries or faith boundaries that makes it acceptable to be elitist on when those arent, but isn't reducing those muggles to something so far from wizards that purists like the Malfoys aren't right.

Why is the line of acceptable elitism having magic? Some public schools have entrance exams, judging pupils on ability, and of course ability to pay or social status or faith are all factors a school could use to define entrants. But somehow the only one that isn't seen as discriminatory is magic?

It's totally elitist. Now that doesn't mean it isn't a great story, and that it creates a very useful and interesting setting, but of course it's elitist - or wizards would go to comprehensive schools too.
