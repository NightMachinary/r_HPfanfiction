Calling Hogwarts "elite" because it does not invite Muggles is deliberately muddying the issue. Hogwarts is part of the wizarding world, not the Muggle one, and those two societies are almost completely separate. It invites every member of the British wizarding world to attend, it is *not* a school for the social elite of the society in which it exists. As such, it is attended by a complete cross-section of that society and is not inhabited by the "upper class" of the wizarding world, meaning that the analogy with British public schools fails.

Saying Hogwarts is elite because it doesn't invite Muggles is like saying the local comprehensive is elite because it doesn't invite French children to attend.
