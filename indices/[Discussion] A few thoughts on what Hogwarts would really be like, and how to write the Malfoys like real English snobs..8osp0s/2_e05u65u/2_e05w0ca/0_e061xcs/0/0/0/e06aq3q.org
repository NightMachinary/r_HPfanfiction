It's more elite than any other school. Faith schools don't even get to discriminate based on faith, fee paying schools have to offer scholarships, etc etc. Hogwarts is far more exclusive than that, and when you consider the way wizards think of themselves as better than muggles (even the good guys think of muggles as strange and /other/ and easy to fool) then yes, Hogwarts is more elitist than any public school is.

Not just on the letters of acceptance, but on the fact it's exclusive to wizards.

  saying a system where there's only one candidate but people still vote for him before he officially becomes leader is an election-based democracy

Loads of elections only have one candidate, particularly where nominations are required. Doesn't stop it being a democratic.
