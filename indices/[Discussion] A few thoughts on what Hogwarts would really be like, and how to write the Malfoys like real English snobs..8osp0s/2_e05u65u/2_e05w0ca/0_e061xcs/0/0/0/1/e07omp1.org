Why the hell would (again, creatures aside) anyone else than wizards /want/ to go to Hogwarts? Saying it's elitis because it only accepts wizards is saying a sports team would be "elitist" for not accepting disembodied spirits. Hogwarts is a school of /magic/, non-magical people would have nothing to /do/ there.
