  I mean, you could technically make it a division of Hogwarts, but it wouldn't be the same school in a real sense.

I 100% agree with you. It wouldn't be, and it wouldn't be nearly as interesting for us as readers. Doesn't mean it isn't elitist however, just that we like it as it is and don't want it to change, which is legitimate but doesn't make it in any way morally superior to a public school.

  Also, yet another argument: Muggles are not citizens of the Wizarding World.
#+end_quote

Perhaps not, but Muggle parents of Muggleborns are heavily involved in the Wizarding world, as are squibs, which means nonmagicals aren't completely excluded from society, and on top of that Muggleborns are still citizens of the muggle world with birth certificates, passports etc and thus Wizarding nationality isn't as separate from muggle one as you'd expect.

Equally, public schools actually don't judge on nationality at all in my experience. I had quite a few foreign nationalities at my school (although a Scottish equivalent not an English public school) - if they can pay they are welcome. So that actually doesn't hold up as a comparison to public schools.

At the end of the day, we might /like/ Hogwarts as an elitist school, but that doesn't make it any better than public and private boarding schools elsewhere in the U.K.
