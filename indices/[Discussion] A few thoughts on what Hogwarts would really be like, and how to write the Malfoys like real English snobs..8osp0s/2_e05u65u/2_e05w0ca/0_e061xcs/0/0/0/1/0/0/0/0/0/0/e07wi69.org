I still don't get what you're saying. What do you propose a /non/-elitist school of /magic/ would look like? Unlike lower-class people or people of a different religion than the school's, Muggles /physically could not, in any event, complete the curriculum/. Hogwarts has nothing to teach them. You don't teach musicology to people who were born deaf, and there's nothing discriminatory to that; you'd have to be delusional to /want/ it in the first place.
