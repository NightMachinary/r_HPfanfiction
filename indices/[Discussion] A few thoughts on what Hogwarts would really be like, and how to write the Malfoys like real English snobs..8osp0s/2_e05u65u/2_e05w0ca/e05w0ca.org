  Firstly, Hogwarts isn't a public school (in the British sense). Rather, it is a public school (in the American sense), i.e. you don't pay fees.

I don't think this is strictly true. JK clearly takes a lot of elements from British public schools, and whilst Hogwarts is non-fee paying, that doesn't mean it isn't an ancient elite boarding school in the same way public schools are.
