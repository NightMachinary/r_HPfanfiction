Very comprehensive. It's true though. People have yelled themselves hoarse at all the bullying that happens in Hogwarts. But that is how it was during those times. I find it very believable, for example, the characterization of Augusta Longbottom in the books. The way she keeps putting down Neville is exactly how it was before. So, even though we might not like them now, that's how it was done in the old times.
