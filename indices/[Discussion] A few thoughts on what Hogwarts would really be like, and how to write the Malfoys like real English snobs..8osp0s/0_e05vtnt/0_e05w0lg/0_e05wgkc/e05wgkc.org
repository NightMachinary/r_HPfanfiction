I think a lot of the language is specific to the setting - you won't use slang for things specific to school or to boarding etc again. Ours became ingrained and we definitely did it without evening noticing after the first year or so, and when I see friends from there and talk about it I definitely drop back into it.

I went on to an ancient university after school and just picked up a different slang language instead, which I definitely still drop into when talking about university with my friends from there.
