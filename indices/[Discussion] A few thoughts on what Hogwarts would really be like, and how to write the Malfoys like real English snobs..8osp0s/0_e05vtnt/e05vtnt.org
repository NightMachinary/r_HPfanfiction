  This tradition is admittedly not really prevalent now, but in the early 20th you'd be lucky if you could understand what they were talking about at all.
#+end_quote

It totally still is. We talked in practically a different language half the time at mine.

#+begin_quote
  Due to the house system, you make friends with people much older/younger than you a lot more than you may think.
#+end_quote

Depends on the size of the school. There were 40 kids in my year in my house, and I knew some in the year above and below but not really beyond that.

#+begin_quote
  Its kind of unthinkable for first years not to get assigned personal second year student guides, this is a tradition as old as time
#+end_quote

We had final years, but yeah this.

#+begin_quote
  calling them professor makes sense, but this always jumped out to me.
#+end_quote

You don't even call you university lecturers â€˜professor' in the U.K. (apart from a small number of high level academics who are given this title), so yeah this is very weird.

#+begin_quote
  They usually express their disapproval at more dog-whistly type things, such as being crass, or crude,
#+end_quote

Or classist, which lets face it is the original British version of racist. I know an awful lot of upper class folk who are horrendously classist, in ways that if it were about skin colour would be hate speech.

#+begin_quote
  They really love croquet, pimms, tennis, and cricket. A flat lawn is a must if you're upper class.
#+end_quote

And rugby and rowing. Rugby in the winter, cricket in the summer, and rowing year round.

#+begin_quote
  They don't usually dress with a lot of opulence
#+end_quote

And the women's hair is always a state.

But yeah, this gives a bit of an insight into how the British upper class is very different to American upper class - blood lines versus money.
