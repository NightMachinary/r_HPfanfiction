Although I'm not entirely sure I agree with your post since Hogwarts is after all a magical school and therefore has it's own culture-nothing in the books can really be wrong in that regard.

I do find it interesting, I'm Australian and went to both public (British private) and private (British public) schools and it's interesting to see the very obvious differences between my experience in both and compared to the upper class experience in Britiain. The rich and wealthy in my year went on cruises, owned holiday homes (near the beach) as well as had massive houses and the snobbery they expressed was towards other schools' students rather than necessarily the less wealthy. Accents were unimportant, some of the richer people even had what would be considered a 'bogan accent' rather than the more posh Australian accent.
