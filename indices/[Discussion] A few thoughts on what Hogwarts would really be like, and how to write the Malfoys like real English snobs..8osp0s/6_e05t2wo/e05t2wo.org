This is great stuff. I'm currently doing a story that starts and remains in the late 80s for several chapters. And since Lucius & Narcissa are very present characters, this seems handy for me as an American, especially with what terms they might use to reference their family members (somehow I managed to accidentally get the Uncle/Aunt use down). A few things:

How would Draco refer to his father when speaking to him? I can't recall an instance of it in canon.

  Your attitude. Snobbery is usually unspoken, and hard to grasp if you're an outsider. Most members of the upper class are not fervent racists like the Malfoys. They usually express their disapproval at more dog-whistly type things, such as being crass, or crude, or whatever.

Could you go into this a bit? The idea of dog whistling over just screeching about it isn't a new idea to me. How might Lucius behave/speak if, say, the he's forced to be in the presence of Muggles, homeless muggles even. He wasn't a (willing) Death Eater in my story, so I'd like to aim for him to be less bigoted about the muggle aspect and more irritated about the class difference.

  If your upper class, your grandfather is ‘Grandpa', and your grandmother is actually probably ‘Granny

  , but to her face they'll most likely say ‘Granny', ‘Granny __' or even ‘Grandmama' if they have a stick up their arse.

This and other things makes me wonder what connection there is between that usage and the fact that a lot of southern Americans speak just this way. I've always referred to my grandmother this way, she always told me to.
