I'd recommend watching British comedy for some examples of snobby set downs. Monty Python, those sorts of shows. For newer shows, Vicious is loaded with insults and the most recent episode of John Oliver showed a British politician insulting fellow politicians. They're not quite portrayals of how I'd imagine Lucius Malfoy to behave, but they're a start. And of course there's Downton Abbey for a more posh take.

As for southern American dialects, they're fairly close to how British English used to be spoken, at least according to my friend who's from the south and now lives in London.
