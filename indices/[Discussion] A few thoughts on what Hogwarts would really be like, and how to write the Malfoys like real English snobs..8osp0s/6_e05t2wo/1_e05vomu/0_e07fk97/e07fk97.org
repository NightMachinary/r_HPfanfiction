  As for southern American dialects, they're fairly close to how British English used to be spoken, at least according to my friend who's from the south and now lives in London.

There are a lot of Southern dialects and a lot of British dialects. This claim only really holds up when you're more specific. E.g. Maryland and Virginia were settled and their culture originally dominated by upper class Anglican royalists from the southwest of England, and the dialect that developed there and has now almost died out is the "posh" Southern accent people associate with the plantation class.
