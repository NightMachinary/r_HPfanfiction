Agreed. The real bottom rungs of society aren't really treated like real people: imagine how they'd make a big deal of supporting animal charities or an injured puppy - that's how they'd treat homeless people.

I also agree that Hogwarts would probably pick up public school mannerisms, but i think a lot are there already. The random 'hexing in the hallways' isn't too different from public school life in the 80s. An older student might look out for you. Or you might end up like Snape.

Corporal punishment is clearly referenced with Filch and the good old days. I don't see Dumbledore allowing it to continue, and certainly not into the 70s / 80s when it was fading anyway - he's pretty progressive.

Hogwarts speech might pick up its own notions, but it is the premier (only?) school for a hidden community. Everyone would talk like that. So a lot of wizard-isms might represent the same thing.
