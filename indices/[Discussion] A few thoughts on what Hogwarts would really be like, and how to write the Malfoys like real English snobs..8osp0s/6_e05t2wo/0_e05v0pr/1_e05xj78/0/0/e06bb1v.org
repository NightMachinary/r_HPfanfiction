Fair point. It also shows the ability for this schooling environment to polarise people along lines of who protects whom.

When I say "you might end up like Snape" I mean that you might end up with your rivalries defining you. The Marauders seem to have this to an extent, but are also fleshed out beyond this rivalry - possibly just because of who they are and their importance as three dimensional characters in the story. Snape seems quite like the bullied kid who gets his own back: his experience appears to be defined by the situation he's in, and he doesn't have much agency in his school experience.

The HPB potions book kind of goes against that but I'm not sure. Anyone with other takes on him?
