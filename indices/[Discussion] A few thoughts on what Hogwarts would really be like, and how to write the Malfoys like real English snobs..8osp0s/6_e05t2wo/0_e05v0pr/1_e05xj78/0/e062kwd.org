  Or you might end up like Snape.

Snape /did/ have an older, more popular student looking out for him, didn't he? Only, that student happened to be Mulciber and an evil bigot, and that was pretty much how Snape ended up cutting ties with Lily and becoming a Death Eater.

I also don't get the feeling he was a general hexing-bag for /everyone/, either; he was more the Marauders' personal archenemy and vice-versa --- and from the spells Harry found in the Potions Textbook, gave as good as he got.
