[[/r/humblebrag][r/humblebrag]] ?

Hogwarts is a school that welcomes students on the basis of their abilities, British public schools welcome students whose parents are willing and able to pay. In one case the filter is merit and in the other it's money which makes your comparison spurious, imo.

Of course *I clearly have my own biases* and while I don't actually want to crucify you, maybe when the revolution comes you would be good enough to just lean up against this wall? ;)
