All very informative, I liked the part about the more “elite” housing for English snobs.

As for the schooling it's interesting, but in the fantasy genre, largely irrelevant.

Authors may draw inspiration from the real world, but they ultimately decide how things work in their story. If they want things to work a certain way, that's just how it is. That doesn't mean the authors or setting is wrong. It's just different.
