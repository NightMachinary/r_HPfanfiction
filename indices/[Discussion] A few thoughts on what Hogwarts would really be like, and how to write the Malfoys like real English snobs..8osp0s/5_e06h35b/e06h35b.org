*Each public school has their own language.*

Although I can't argue with that I can't even imagine how annoying that would have been to read. I'm thankful that it wasn't included and hope to freaking god people don't take your advice and try to include it in their fanfic.

*Beatings from teachers were very common, even in the 80s.*

I think that when dealing with young magic users and the possibility of accidental magic, that this would be a very, very bad idea. This might be an apples to oranges comparison on your part.

As the main wizarding school that most magical people attended, it's going to be under a lot of scrutiny and secrets would be much harder to keep especially considering how small the magical society is. I'm sure Malfoy Sr would not stand for Draco being hazed...and those doing the hazing/were hazed have parents who know each other or work together. It's too easy to prove guilt and therefore get caught as well. I'm not saying thta it didn't happen but not to the extent you're suggesting. That said, I can see muggleborns being very easy targets.

*What to call your family if you're* *upper class:*

I think that you also have to consider the longevity of the people in these stories and the impact that would have on cultural norms, etc. Instead of comparing it to the 70's and 80's, you might want to compare it to the 30's and 40's (or possibly earlier). Their ruling body (Wizengamot) was most likely filled with people born between 1810 and 1900 - what kind of cultural impact would that have?

In regards to family names, you might want to go back even further in time since the generations are so long. What did they call grandparents in the 1700 and 1800's? I mean, that's when Granny was possibly born. You could have a great grandparent who knew Shakespeare

You also can't assume what sports they played - would croquet be considered too nouveau? Tennis is even newer and Pimm's is from the relatively recent 1840's (how gauche!).

Personally, I think JK's world building was fine. As you said, they are children's stories. But I think fic writers need to cast a much, much wider net if they want to add to JK's world.
