  Although I can't argue with that I can't even imagine how annoying that would have been to read. I'm thankful that it wasn't included and hope to freaking god people don't take your advice and try to include it in their fanfic.

Yeah. Readers already have to absorb a lot of new vocabulary related to everything magical. Making them learn new vocab for everyday things too is a pretty big cognitive burden.

I say this even as someone who's into constructed languages and once started worldbuilding an AU where a good portion of the magical community of Great Britain and Ireland spoke a Celtic language.
