What is the social importance of Hogwarts? I wouldn't say it's the same as of Eton for example. Literally everyone in their society goes to Hogwarts. It's not going to imply any kind of special social status or educational level or provide you with special networking opportunities or anything like that.

If Eton was the only school in the country and admitted literally everyone, would you still expect it to have any kind of "status"?
