Rowling didn't really base Hogwarts on a public school. She based it more on an ordinary secondary school (that would have reflected her own educational experience) that just happened to be a boarding school. But since it's supposed to be a fantastical, whimsical, magical place, those comparisons are pointless anyway. I can find fault with a lot of what Rowling does, but how can you say she got something 'wrong' in an institution she invented? She can do what she likes with it.
