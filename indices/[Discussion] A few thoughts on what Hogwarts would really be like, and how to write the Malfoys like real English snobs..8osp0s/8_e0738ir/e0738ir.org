Perhaps it is worth noting that a lot of the public school aspects are implied to be present at Dudley's school (albeit somewhat parodied). Rowling seems to have deliberately decided to make Hogwarts different. We are set up with an amusing comparison between Dudley's school where they wear an archaic uniform and carry sticks to beat people etc and Hogwarts where they do exactly the same, except the sticks can also be used for wonders.

Once corporal punishment would have been likely at Hogwarts (see Filch's complaints), but Dumbledore seems to have tried to end that.
