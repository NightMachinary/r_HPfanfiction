As others have already mentioned, you fail to account for the Wizarding World being a completely different culture. Some of this stuff is interesting, sure, but Lucius Malfoy /very much would/ scream and get possibly murderous if Draco married a Muggle-born witch; he's /not/ a Muggle snob, he's a wizarding Purebloodist --- a tradition which only /somewhat/ parallels Muggle snobbery.
