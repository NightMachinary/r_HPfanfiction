Why would Arthur need a flying car he doesn't intend to use? Sometimes people also invent things for entertainment.

It's a thought experiment, essentially. It might be pointless practically-speaking (and I completely agree it would be, except perhaps if it were designed to protect from large-scale spellfire), but it's interesting to consider how various things fit together to possibly create something interesting. I'm curious about the how, not the why.

eg. Would they invent a hamster-wheel-esque contraption so that animated constructs could drive a motor and thus move wheels without effort on the part of the wizard? Especially for heavy stuff that might be difficult to levitate or shrink or whatever?

It's the kind of thing I find interesting to consider. :)
