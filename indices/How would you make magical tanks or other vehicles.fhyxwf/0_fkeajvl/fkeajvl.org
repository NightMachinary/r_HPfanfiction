Bear in mind that the law imposed by the Ministry is, like in most muggle governments, meant to restrict the non-governmental, unapproved people from enchanting muggle objects (or anything else for that matter).

Its not about stopping everything all together, its about regulating and controlling risks to the Ministry's overall objective: enforcement of the Statute of Secrecy in the UK. Just as laws that control how prescription drugs are administered are not meant to discourage drug use but to prevent abuse or overindulgences that present a possibility of de-stabilizing civil society.

As for your specific question, let us ask another question: why would you need one? Tanks are by design a method to protect people in open terrain from anti-infantry weapons such as firearms and low-impact explosives. They were implemented by the UK in WW I to safely cross the No Man's Land without suffering enormous casualties. People, muggle or wizard, create or invent things to fill a need, not just because they can. And a tank serves no purpose more effectively than what is already feasible for wizards and their society.

Or to put it more simply, inventions serve a need in society. Wizards adapt muggle ideas because they serve specific needs (wireless for entertainment, magic train for comfortable travel experience/vacations/less able wizards, etc.).
