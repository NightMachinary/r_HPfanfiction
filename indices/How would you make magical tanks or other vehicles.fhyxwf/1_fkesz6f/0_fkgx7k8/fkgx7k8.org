Nope, not for a fic. It's literally just something I was curious about and wanted to see what input people had. I barely have time to write the fics I have already, nevermind new ones for a fandom this... exacting.

I don't know if runes or enchantments to prevent spell damage are a thing (genuine question - are they?), but I suppose lining it with basilisk skin could achieve the same end. Those are canonically resistant to spells, right?

I like the idea of the giant wand. That's pretty cool. I could see that sort of thing being developed as a kind of artillery-of-magic (to answer Xesh's point about inventions being invented to meet a need :D).
