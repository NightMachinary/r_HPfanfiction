To answer your question (even if just a thought experiment):

Imagine first taking a general cart of some kind, even like one of the thestral drawn carriages.

Next, you would imbue all of the outsides with Runes/enchantments that would prevent spell damage/impact damage. Which specifically would be up to you/what is available within the world you build (I am assuming this is for a fic you might be writing).

After you have a carriage that is basically the body of the tank, you would craft what would amount to a gigantic wand, perhaps only capable of channeling a single spell, likely Bombarda or Reducto. From there you mount it atop the carriage with a simple rotating swivel platform that could be gotten from anywhere (like turning a wheel on its side).

Next is propulsion. Given that they have brooms with charms to handle propulsion and steering built in by use of touch controls through a single wooden shaft, you could install something similar.

And voila ... you would have what amounts to effectively a purely magic tank.
