My idea would be something along the lines of how Dresden Files handles individual spells: there is only so much power available in each spell and the more people that know it, the weaker it becomes. Apply it to magic in general and the pureblood claim becomes true simply because there are so many muggles that the number of muggleborns is increasing and that results in weaker magic for everyone. A war that kills a lot of wizards, no matter from which side, would make magic stronger.

Until the numbers start to rise once more and the magic starts to weaken again.
