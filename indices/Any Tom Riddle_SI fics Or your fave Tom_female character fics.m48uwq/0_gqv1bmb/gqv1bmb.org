You're in luck! I have a category for this in my google doc. I love Historical importance too, I happen to be re-reading it now :)

linkao3(nightmare by provocative_envy) completed Tomione time travel fic, brilliant development of all characters (even side characters). Mystery and plot twists galore. This Hermione has a similar personality to Harry in historical importance.

linkao3(his persephone by Reneehart) another time travel Tomione except rather than being sent back to stop him, she is sent to join him.

linkao3(blood and gold by obsidianpen) /another/ time travel Tomione with manipulation on both sides, I love the power plays. It's not set at Hogwarts so the ideas are fresh.

linkao3(ink and parchment by rose_by_another_name) fem!Harry/Tom, she gets sorted into Slytherin. It's a bit too tropey for my tastes but the writing improves as the fic progresses, it goes from Years 1-7 so quite long.

linkao3(unbecoming by turnpike) fem!Harry/Voldemort. Features threadmagic, like Historical Importance.

linkao3(Byzantium by TreacleTeacups) fem!Harry/Tom. Fairytale elements AU, featuring the Fae and a curse.

linkao3(we are kin by artsydeath) fem!Harry/Tom in which she runs away from the Dursleys and lives as a wolf animagus for years until she comes across Nagini, who in turn introduces her to Tom.

linkao3(appetance by elysian_drops) fem!Harry/Voldemort in which he discovers she is a Horcrux in the graveyard.
