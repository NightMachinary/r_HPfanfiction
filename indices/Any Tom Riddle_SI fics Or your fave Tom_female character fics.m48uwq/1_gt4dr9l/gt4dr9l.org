linkao3(appetance by elysian_drops) fem!Harry/Voldemort in which he discovers she is a Horcrux in the graveyard. Such a nice and pleasant writing and the author is a sweetheart who updates often. It's really well written.

linkao3(we are kin by artsydeath) fem!Harry/Tom. A sane Voldemort who discovers that she is a horcrux. Harry can't handle having to embody two active souls in her body and unravels entirely. Implied assault/torture from the Order allegedly which left Harry traumatized and sought out her enemy for help. (on hiatus but not abandoned).

linkao3(corruption by itsjustsilver). Hera goes to meet her death in the Forbidden Forest but there Voldemort discovers that she is a horcrux. He takes her at his side and things starts to go downhill from there on for Hera. She didn't die but that would have been a better deal for her than what is gonna happen later. Definitely a heavy fic.

linkao3(Grace Potter and The Great Mistake by RonChee). Starts to take place at the graveyard in the end of HP and The Goblet of Fire where Voldemort kidnaps Grace for a ritual. HUGE TW for sexual assault and torture. It's not a soft fic but it's very well-written.

Enjoy!
