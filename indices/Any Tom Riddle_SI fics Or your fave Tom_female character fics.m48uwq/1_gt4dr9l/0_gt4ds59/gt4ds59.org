  Appetence--- defined as an attraction, a natural affinity, or an instinctive desire. A cosmic sort of bond that clouds the mind until all thought is consumed by that singular point of infatuation. When Voldemort divines what Harri Potter truly means to him all those years ago in the graveyard, a festering sort of obsession begins. His horcrux. A part of his split soul, crafted from his marrow, magic, and might--- his very own damning appetence. He knows what has been kept from him, what rightfully belongs at his side, and he wants her back.

  "... didn't know where else to go." Tom finds himself with his nemesis living in his wardrobe, bemused and disturbed but also curious about the strange fate that ties them together. - Or: life has left them both just a bit broken (but it doesn't have to stay that way).
