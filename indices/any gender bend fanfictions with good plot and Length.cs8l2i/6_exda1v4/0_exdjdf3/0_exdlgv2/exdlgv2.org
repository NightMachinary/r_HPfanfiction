You don't sound like a dick. That is a valid point to make about the fic. Personally, I really like having the super long chapters and I know the story well enough now that I can usually read the latest chapter just after skimming the one before to remind myself where exactly I am in the story, but that's mostly because I've reread it, like, 5 times. For someone who's only read it once or is less familiar with/invested in the fic it can really hurt the reading experience.
