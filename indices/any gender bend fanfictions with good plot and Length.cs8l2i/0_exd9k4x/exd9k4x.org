!linkffn(Weasley Girl)

This fic features a female Ron, and is heavily canon divergent. It's a great fanfiction.

!linkffn(Victoria Potter)

This fic is a fem!Harry fic that has almost exclusively original plot. It's very good.

!linkffn(The odds were never in my favor)

This is probably one of the most involved fanfictions out there, up there with Prince of Slytherin in terms of worldbuilding and complexity. Neville is the Boy Who Lived, and Alexandra Potter has her own enemies to face. Voldemort has barely been in the story so far, and the plot has a much larger scope with far more powerful players than Tom Riddle.

!linkffn(Limpieza De Sangre)

Fem!Voldemort. This one makes her into a very interesting and well balanced character. I don't care for the climax or ending of the story, but the rest of it is amazing.
