I honestly don't know if there's any really good ones. I read them all when my standards for fanfiction were quite low. I'll list a few I can remember off the top of my head though. Don't remember how good they were though. They're all incomplete though.

Linkffn(Season of Change) I think this one is good.

Linkffn(Son of Potter, Daughter of Black) This one has that dumb political shit where 15 year olds speak all formal and whatever to certain people.

Linkffn(To Reach Without) Big angst here, awkward dialogue pacing (giant paragraphs of text between single lines of dialogue make it feel super slow), and the author feels kinda pretentious with his constant changes of spell incantations.
