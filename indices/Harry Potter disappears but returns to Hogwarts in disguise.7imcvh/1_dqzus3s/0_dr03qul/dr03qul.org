[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7931017/1/Harry-Daniels-and-the-Order-of-Shadows][Harry Daniels and the Order of Shadows]] sounds like the right title. It's a majestic wrong-boy-who-lived fic. The author has two sequels on his profile.

The summary that you mentioned sounds like "A Cloak and Dagger State of Affair's" by Sage Ra. Does an enormous underground pit city in Eastern Europe sound familiar? Metamorph Harry acting as a body double for Fudge and accidentally assassinating a foreign head of state?
