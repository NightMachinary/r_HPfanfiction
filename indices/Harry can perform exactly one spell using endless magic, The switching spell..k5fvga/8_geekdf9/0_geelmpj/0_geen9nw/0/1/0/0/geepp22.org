I think some aspects of the series after the original came out as forced or rushed. I mean Solangelo works, but it is just missing setting and background.

He dropped the ball by putting diverse characters like Beckendorf in the background in the first series, then he overcompensated in the next series.

I mean, Leo is cool, but some stuff doesn't feel as natural flowing as in original series
