I am not a romance intense either. Though you cannot really leave it out in a teenage school series. It appears even in the background, and personally I think I need to work on my romance writing skills, so I have read some from time to time.

However, even in no romance series, OOC behavior like this kind of takes me out of a story. Even a good story can do that if suddenly Ron and Hermione start calling each other "love" the day after they got together.
