in the graveyard, when Tom is spamming killing curses, he keeps switching places with death eaters so they die, or he can switch Snape with Peter during 3rd year and 4th year never comes up, switch fawkes in 2nd year with a rooster, switch himself and Dumbledore in 1st year or in 5th year switch a pebble with Sirius so he knows he's safe.

It's op af to use said ability, imagine how versatile it can become, you can switch EVERYTHING.
