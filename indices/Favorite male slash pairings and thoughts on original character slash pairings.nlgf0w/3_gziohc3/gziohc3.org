My inner monologue be like â€˜don't tell them you'll ruin your street cred' but my favourite male slash pairing is Tom/Harry! Obviously only time travel, AU, or Horcrux Tom so there's not a stonking great age difference. I love different author's exploration of Tom's character, and JKR made them to be perfect foils of each other so they're similar but different in an interesting way. I dislike relationships where there's a power imbalance or when the author glorifies toxic relationships though, so I gotta wade through a lot of shit.

Original characters are fine but I prefer it when someone invents a backstory and new personality for a named background character in canon. Otherwise I skip over the fic because there's a 95% chance the OC will be a self insert.
