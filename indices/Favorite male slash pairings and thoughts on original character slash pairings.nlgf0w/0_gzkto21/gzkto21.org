I probably read the most Harry/Tom OR Harry/OMC. And omg I love love love when I find a good m/m/m fic. Kind of difficult bc I'm not the /biggest/ fan of Snarry, though I have given it a chance in the past. (I just mean that I feel like I see Draco/Harry/Snape quite a bit tho I could totally be wrong).

Otherwise, I'm also a fan of Harry with most of the Weasley brothers. Got a soft spot for him and the twins but not a ton of long finished works for them together.

And I kinda said it already, but this is one of the few fandoms where I'm totally down for an OC being paired up with a Main. I just love Harry centric stuff but I'm not super into some of his most popular ships. So checking out Harry/OMC fic gives me more reading material. :D
