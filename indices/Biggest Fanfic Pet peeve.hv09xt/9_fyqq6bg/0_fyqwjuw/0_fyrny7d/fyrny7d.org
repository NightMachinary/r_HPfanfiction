The thing is that... magic /can/ do anything. If not by the time Harry goes at Hogwarts or even at the point of his death, someone somewhere will have discovered/created a way to do it with magic.

As Belial666 once wrote (I'm paraphrasing):

  Magic is thought, spells are the words that allow you to express it and enchantments are essays (quite literally with runes). The only difference with actual languages is that most people will only really know around a thousand words and even fewer people can write professionally.

Of course, there are certain limitations like the transfiguration of food, but that's why wizardkind turned themselves to Charms and Herbology to produce food. The thing with magic is that you can do anything with it. You just have to want it badly enough and be creative and intelligent about it.
