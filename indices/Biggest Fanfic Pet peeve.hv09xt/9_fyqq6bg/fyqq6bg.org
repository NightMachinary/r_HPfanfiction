I have [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6osl0v/discussion_pet_peeves_that_will_instantly_turn/dkknhq4/][so many]]. But if you forced me to pick just one, it would be nerfing magic (and in particular, its abilities relative to Muggle technology). The "what if I was a wizard?" aspect of HP is its primary draw, for me. Nerfing magic ruins that.
