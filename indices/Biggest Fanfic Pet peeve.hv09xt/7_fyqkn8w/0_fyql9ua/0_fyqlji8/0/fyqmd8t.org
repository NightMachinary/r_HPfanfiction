Can you find it? Cuz I'd love to read that lol. I know I've made this point before, and I'd LOVE to see a full on rant about it. FFS it's been /years/ and I still struggle some days with day two hair!

On the flip side, I've read about Hermione brushing her hair 100 times to "fix it" at which point I'd start raging and my blood pressure would start to rise. That's not how it works!
