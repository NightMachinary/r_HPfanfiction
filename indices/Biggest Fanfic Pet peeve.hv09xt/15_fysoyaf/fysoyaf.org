Brilliant! Prepare for a long-ish rant!

When Harry goes to gringotts and suddenly he is this overpowered, multi-lordship, betrothed ‘god' I mean, bruh, first of all HOW DOES HE EVEN HAVE THAT MANY LORDSHIPS and secondly just because the horcrux is removed, doesn't mean he literally becomes 1000000 times more powerful

When his name is not ‘Harry' but ‘Harold' ‘Hadrian' or some other name.

No comment. Sorry to break it to you, but he is Harry and I'm afraid I will not take another name

When simple surnames or words are misspelt, like once someone misspelled ‘hermione' - it's not that hard.

For some reason it just really annoys me when things are misspelled.

When people's names are shortened or have nicknames.

‘Mione' , ‘Pup', ‘Cub', ‘Dumbles', ‘Moldyshorts'. They are good at first, but after a while, just no.

When weasleys are bashed for nearly no reason, or evil!dumbledore. The amount of OOC required is too much. To this day I still do not understand why some authors make dumbledore Evil, manipulative etc.

Harry/Ginny fics.

I'm sorry, but I don't really see this pairing working out. Especially in fanon, where she is seen as a possessive potion-addict evil person. Please, stop.

Soul-bonds

Noooo! Not soul bonds! I don't see this working. For me, soulmates already push my boundaries. A ‘soul bond' is basically a horcrux. Also, for hinny soul bonds they suddenly need to be constantly in each other's presence. No, No, No.

Overpowered!Harry fics where out of the blue he becomes a god.

Seriously? How bored are you?

There are probably loads of other types of fics that I HATE but it's kinda late and i'm sub-conciously typing this. Some fanfics have been ruined for ridiculous reasons.
