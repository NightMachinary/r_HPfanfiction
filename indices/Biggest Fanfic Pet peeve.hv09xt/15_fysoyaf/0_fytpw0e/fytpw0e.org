Hmm. Mione is kinda ok with me especially cos that how i hear her name being called in the movies but it should be said by close people to her like harry or ron. The others not really unless its harry being a dog animagus at a young age and being called by sirius as a cub. That would make sense. The others not much unless the story is purposely written as a comedy strip.

Manipulative Dumbledore kinda depends to the extent. I can say dumbledore is somehow manipulative but not to the point he toys with harry.

Harry/Ginny fics - it ok to me unless its written badly. I mean it is canon pair and most ive read are time travel fics with past actually being paired with her. OOC is a no no though.

For Weasley being bashed - there were fics were they were written evil and definitely OOC to me. I find Molly and Arthur very kind and evil them is jist not my cup of tea. Ron bashing is another tho specially he acts like a total arse when jealous but not to the point he's the arse of the century bashing.

Soulmates would depend on the fic. If its already mentioned as a norm like alpha-beta-omega stories or another type where everyone falls on the same category like all is bounded to another ect.

Lordships still depends on the story, like deleda est where harry timetravels and still carries the black heritage but those which are just OOC, really will drop those. Ive dropped i think 3 of them already.
