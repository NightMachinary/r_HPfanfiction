Lord Potter-Black who is richer than god, has multiple inherited seats on the Wizengamot, becomes besties with the goblins, and outsmarts Dumbledore at age eleven. And the preteen political geniuses of Slytherin house.. I understand the appeal of the power fantasy, but it's just so insufferable. And what's up with the lordships? The only character who uses that title in canon is Voldemort.
