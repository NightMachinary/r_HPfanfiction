While yes i do agree with your opinion of major change in personality without reason is bad.

My biggest one is that so many people make Harry so overpowered without very much reason. Sure if he trains he would be able to get stronger yes, but making him a god from the get go without reason gets on my nerves.

That and the interpretation of "neither can live while the other survives" where neither can live actual normal lifes while the other is just surviving by magic holding them together isn't used more.
