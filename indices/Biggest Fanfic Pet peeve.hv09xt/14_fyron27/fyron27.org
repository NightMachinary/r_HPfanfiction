Mine's /Good Guy Harry/(tm)

The sort of Harry that does no wrong, is always stupidly nice to everyone, but throws a tantrum whenever he sees something he doesn't like - and is /obviously/ right in doing so. And, by extension, his entire friends group being an echo chamber of that. Characters are /supposed to have flaws/. The lack of nuance in that is just astonishing. EVERYONE has quirks and biases. The whole "Perfect Good Guy Harry Who Fights Inequality 24/7 And Shits Rainbows" trope just doesn't make it a good read. It makes the story bland.

And on the opposing side, the "Kill All Muggles" dark!Harry whose only personality traits are being sadistic, edgy and racist is pretty much just as bad.

I guess the real pet peeve is fanfics that read like political propaganda for real-life political movements without anything else going on in the fic. We are surrounded by politics IRL every single day. Going on FFN/AO3 to read more politics just isn't a good time.
