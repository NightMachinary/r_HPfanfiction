Yours, plus events either diverging from canon without a clear reason or being forced back onto the canon rails when they /should/ be diverging - the worst of the latter I've seen has been fics where Sirius dies around the end of Harry's fifth year despite not fighting in the DoM.

A smaller but still irksome one: Characters spouting information that they shouldn't know yet without explanation or with just the explanation of "Harry studied more". One of the warning signs of a particularly bad Indy!Harry is him rattling on about Horcruxes and/or the Gaunts and/or the orphanage as if this is just readily-available information that anyone should know.
