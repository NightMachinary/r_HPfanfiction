Justifying Hermione's relationship with an older man by her use of the time turner in her third year. I remember someone calculated that at most she would have aged by a few weeks, not a full year. I'm not against a ship of her with an older man, but not when she's 14, that's creepy.

Poor abused Draco. I'm not against a Draco redemption story, but not when his redemption consist solely in explaining that nothing he did or said from book one to halfway through book six was really him and pretending that someone (usually Lucius) was "forcing" him to act this way.
