For Harry Potter fics specifically, my biggest ones are:

- Dedicating an entire chapter, or even multiple chapters, to Gringotts and/or shopping. No one cares about the inheritances, lordships, money, wardrobe, fancy school supplies, TARDIS disguised as a trunk, or seven-part wand that you decided to give Harry. Especially since there's a very good chance that none of it will ever actually matter.
- Runes are the best magic ever, and can do literally anything. No, they're actually canonically useless and have no actual magical abilities. The only thing they are good for us reading ancient texts, which is also the one thing I never see them used for.
- Swearing on your magic. Again, this has no basis in canon, it rarely serves any real purpose, and its existence as an option just opens up plotholes.
