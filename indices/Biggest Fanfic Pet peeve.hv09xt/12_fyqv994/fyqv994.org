Making characters into cartoons (ergo.: Dumbledore being an asshole for absolutely no reason, Ron being defined exclusively for the times he wasn't there instead of all the instances in which he was and his help was essential, Harry being Lord modest that shall never do any wrong...), rape scenes (I find them really uncomfortable), muggle-wank, hand-waved magical system (giving characters the ability to use wandless magic is acceptable, making it so the only thing they need to do to use it is desiring really hard isn't), MC having crippling self-confidence issues that never go away, soulmates, overly helpful goblins (making them collaborate with the character to get more gold or be professional/have impeccable work ethics is one thing, making them bend backwards and forwards because a kid remembered their name though is just plain ridiculous), making MC become Lord of a cubic ton of houses (if it was so easy why the Hell their parents didn't do this), moralism (there is a very defined line between having a character with a set of morals and having a character force-feeding his morals to anyone unlucky enough to stay still long enough).
