It's an odd pet peeve but mine is gender bend Harry Potter that isn't tagged. I've read a few that I've liked but I just can not stand when it's not tagged. I'm also not the biggest fan of Harriet or Lilly being used as the genderbend name of Harry but that's just me being a bit picky.

Another is when character names are not capitalized in a fic. I will usually try reading a bit to see if it improve but will quit reading quick if it doesn't.
