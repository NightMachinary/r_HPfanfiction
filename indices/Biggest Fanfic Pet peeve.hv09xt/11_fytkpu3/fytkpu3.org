When the author doesn't keep track of their own story and contradicts themselves.

I read one fic that had an entire chapter devoted to Hermione purposefully harming herself, then several chapters later it had Hermione thinking about how she's never purposefully harmed herself in her life. And it wasn't a dream sequence or Hermione being written as having a faulty memory, it read as if the author had forgotten what they wrote in the prior chapter, even when it had been a large plot point of that chapter. And then it was never addressed again??

If the author themselves isn't going to pay attention to what's happening in the story, why should I?
