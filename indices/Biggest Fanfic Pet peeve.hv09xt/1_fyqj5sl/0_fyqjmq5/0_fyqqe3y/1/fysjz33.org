I won't even read those.

Spelling the names wrong, especially "Zambini" instead of Zabini, or the Janus Thackery unit. Also Americanized names like "Little Whining" instead of Little Whinging.

Listing the entire canon Sorting Hat song and/or Gringotts door poem. That's just padding your word count.

Genderbending a character, and then making them gay. If you want those two characters together, and they're already male/female, just make it a het pairing.
