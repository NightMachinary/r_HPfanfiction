Misformntioned text. You know how when you copy and paste a text from PDF to word the text comes with, like, two line paragraphs starting and ending at random and having three or more blank spaces between each word? I honestly don't particularly care for grammar, but this instances in particular really pisses me off, almost impossible to read.
