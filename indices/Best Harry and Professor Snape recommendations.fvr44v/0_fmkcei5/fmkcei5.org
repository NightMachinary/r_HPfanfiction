The flair you are looking for is "Request." The "Recommendations" flair is for when /you/ want recommending a fic for the rest of /us/ to read.

With that aside, HP and the Problem of Potions is a pretty fun fic that where they have an interesting dynamic. Harry is still a Gryffindor, and pretty much his canon self, but the major is change is that he really likes potions. Snape still doesn't like Harry though.
