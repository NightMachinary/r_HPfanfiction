I saw one a long time ago where Hogwarts read /My Immortal/. I looked for it again recently, but I couldn't find it - I think it may have been deleted, but I really hope not.

What I remember: there were two (I think) OCs (possibly reader-submitted), one of whom was named Marty. The last chapter was a stinger set years later where the Marty OC got an iPod (?) for Christmas and freaked out because /My Immortal/ had had iPods in it.

If anyone remembers and/or has a backup of this fic saved, I would really appreciate it! :)
