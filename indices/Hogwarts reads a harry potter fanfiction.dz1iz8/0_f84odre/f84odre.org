Hermione: Scribere Fabulam... Scribere Fabulam... Scribere Fabulam...

Ron: Hermione, what are you doing?

Hermione: Trying a spell. What does it look like? Scribere Fabulam...

Harry: What spell is it?

Hermione: Well, it's for Arithmancy. We have to figure out the incantation and wand movement from a Charm that Professor Septima described. Scribere Fabulam...

Ron: I thought Arithmancy was just all maths and stuff. You actually cast spells in that class?

Hermione: You would have known that if you had tried it out. Scribere Fabulam... Ugh! The spell is supposed to conjure a book with a fictional story, but I just can't get it to work.

Harry: Are you sure you have the right incantation? Because it sounds like you're trying to conjure some fabulous scribbles.

Ron: So... Hermione writing normally?

Harry: I was more thinking Malfoy, you couldn't take anything he scribbles seriously.

/The trio giggles and sniggers./

Hermione: Maybe?... It's a Latin translation of Write a Story, maybe I got the translation wrong?

Ron: Write a story? Wouldn't it be create it conjure a story?

Hermione: Normally, yes. But spells aren't always that literal, and what I found could fit the equations if I found the right wand movement... Scribere Fabulam... UGH!

Harry: What about a translation from... the Latin word for author or something.

Hermione: ... That might actually work.

/Hermione makes a bunch of notes for a couple minutes than readies her wand again./

Hermione: Auctor Artis

/Suddenly, a scroll of parchment appears, displaying an essay of words in messy handwriting./

Hermione: YES!!!

Ron: What is it... Oh did it work?

Hermione: Yes, and it's all thanks to Harry's idea!

Harry: Well... I didn't do much...

Hermione: Oh, nonsense, I'd have been stuck on this for the rest of the day if you hadn't helped. Turns out the incantation translates roughly to Author's Craft.

Ron: Nice going, Harry. What's the story?

/Hermione picks up the parchment./

Hermione: There's no title... It doesn't look very good... In fact it looks awful.

Ron: Even better, let's hear it!

Hermione: If you say so... Ehem... “Hi my name is Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way...”
