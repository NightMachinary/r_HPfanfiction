[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): who cares about the puny Wizengamot and lordships if he conquers half of Europe, commands thousands of Magicals and millions of Muggle soldiers, and becomes the damn Emperor? Also, he fried thousands of enemy soldiers with wandless Fiendfyre in battles.

Another Fiendfyre happy Harry is in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167). He just doesn't want to take that shit anymore, and is willing to literally burn down the entire Ministry and Wizengamot.
