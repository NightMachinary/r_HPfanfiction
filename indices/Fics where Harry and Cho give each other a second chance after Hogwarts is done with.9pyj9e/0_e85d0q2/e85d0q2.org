This is a really fascinating and original premise; I cant think of any off the top of my head but that relationship could go in so many different ways. What did she do during Voldemort's reign and will any (in)action cause lingering tensions with Harry? How will his relationship with Ron change as a result of him being with Ginny, etc.?

You're right that they sdidnt work together in OOTP because they didnt know who they were yet and, hopefully, after the war they would then be ready to try again.
