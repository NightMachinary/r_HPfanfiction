[[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/cepls-introduction-to-femharrys.html][Which fem!Harry]] you want: always-girl or turned-to-be-girl (or returned-*)? If the former, “Videus Charm” linkffn(13197260) is one of the best (except, I am not totally sure, why she is a female). “Pranking the Tournament” linkffn(13132217) is from the other group.
