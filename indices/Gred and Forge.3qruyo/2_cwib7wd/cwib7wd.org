My big question is, in 90% of the Weasley-bashing fics I've read, Gred & Forge (ha!) are usually two of the only ones who are "good" and not trying to manipulate Harry. Sometimes Charlie and Bill get thrown in since they're far away, but even then occasionally they're scheming in the background (Bill MUST be a schemer, he works for the goblins!)
