I could go on about all the twin tropes... :/

The one that bothers me the most is that they're always called either "the twins" or "the pranksters" when being referred to as a group. Why not just "the two of them" or "Fred and George"? Also, the whole

"we-"

"finish each-"

"others'-"

"sentences!" thing drives me CRAZY! Literally /no one/ does that. Unless the two of them have a telepathic connection that's been previously explained, I just can't see how it would be necessary. It's not /clever/, it's just kind of annoying.
