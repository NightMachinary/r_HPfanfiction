The sentence finishing is infuriating. I can handle the occasional back-and-forth as long as they switch speaker at the end of a sentence (or at a point where there's a natural pause in the sentence), but things like your example are just... no.

"The twins" thing though--that's just a matter of time. It has the least amount of letters type. (Anyone using "the pranksters" I'm going to assume also uses "the black haired boy" and other descriptive phrases, which is a whole different problem altogether.)
