  I actually find this one amusing as long as it isn't overdone. Same with Snapes billowing robes.

To be fair, I've read this quite good plot point once where Harry discovered a spell to make one's robes billow (and realized that Snape used it for show). This leads to him discovering how childishly Snape actually behaves, and helps him grow out of his stubborn hatred of him and learns to pity him.
