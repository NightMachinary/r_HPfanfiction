My favorite 'niche' is fics that portray Voldemort/Tom Riddle as more rational than in canon.

I can enjoy fics in which he is the villain or the protagonist, as long as his character is well written. Unfortunately, due to FFN's tagging system, the Voldemort-as-protagonist fics are easier to find.

The most common tropes I've encountered are time travel back to before Riddle became Voldemort, Voldemort as mentor/parental figure to Harry, and Tom Riddle grows up with a magical friend/sibling at the orphanage. There's often some overlap with other tropes, such as 'Master of Death'!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, or Heroine!Hermione. I love to find well written fics with plot ideas I haven't seen before.
