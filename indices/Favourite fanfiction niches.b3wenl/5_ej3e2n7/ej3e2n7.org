This isn't specific to HP, but I love fics that feature a close (but emphatically /not/ romantic/sexual) relationship between a teacher and a student. Good examples of the kind of thing I mean are [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11779530][Nightmare]] linkao3(11779530) and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/56192][Immutability]] linkao3(56192). Fics like that are damned hard to find (at least outside of the Snape-adopts-Harry genre, which I'm not super fond of), so if you've got a suggestion, do please drop me a link!
