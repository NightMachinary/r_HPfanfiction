I'm a big fan of fanfics where a character is basically minding their own business somewhere else - like Canada or Australia - while on vacation, and they casually bump into Snape. He's somehow survived Nagini, and he's living life basically as a muggle.

I also really like fics where the author delves into the castle as a magically "alive" structure that's more aware of what's going on than most people realize.
