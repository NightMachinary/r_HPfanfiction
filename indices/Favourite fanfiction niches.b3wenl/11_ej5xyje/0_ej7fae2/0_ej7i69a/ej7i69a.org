Definitely imo. They are one of my favourite pieces of fiction and could imo be easily a very successful fantasy series if they were released as standalone books. Many people have issues with the main character, since she is a bit of an antithesis to the rational controlled hero that people in the fandom love so much. She can be quite the shithead but the books and other characters absolutely acknowledge that. Generally the first book is a bit standalone, but the other three that are currently out are pretty connected. The first one was definitely the hardest for me to get through, with the least complex story and the most repetition. It picks up a lot after that.
