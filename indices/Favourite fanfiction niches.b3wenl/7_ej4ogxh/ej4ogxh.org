I like fics where characters tinker around with magic and come up with new things, as well as using existing magics in new ways.

Hermione's chemistry spells in linkffn(The Arithmancer)

Butter powered death beams in linkffn(So, how can we Weaponize this?)

Harry's arsenal of runes in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path)

The Black Phantom's sticking charm superpowers in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina)

Harry recreating a bunch of stuff from Lord of the Rings and Dungeons & Dragons in linkffn(For love of magic)
