I like the Transcedent thing too. Where the MC becomes so powerful that they transcend in some aspect. My current favorite example is an original story where the MC quite literally become very similar to most monotheistic ideas of God. That's actually why I use the word transcendent.

My way of thinking about it is that character X is so beyond someone that it is analogous to a fictional character fighting a real person. It doesn't matter how strong Goku is because he exists in a state that can't rival someone who actually exists. It's less about a strongman against an infant because you could actually imagine the infant winning. It's more like a strongman trying to punch color or some other abstract concept.

In HP Blindness... Harry seems to transcend in his understanding of death. He sees it as a comfortable inevitability after becoming the master of death. He also doesn't go full genocide because he knows normal people could never understand that he was helping them. At least that was how I interpreted the ending. It's not as extreme, but I sort it in the same way.
