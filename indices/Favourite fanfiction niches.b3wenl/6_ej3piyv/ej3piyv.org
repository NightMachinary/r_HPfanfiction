Daphne Greengrass-level minor (we practically only know their names) characters galore, e.g. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1117133][The Accidental Renaissance of Zacharias Smith]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16460747][and whose army?]] (Anthony Goldstein), [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9525716/chapters/21539333][Tell Brave Deeds of War]] (Terry Boot, Michael Corner, Anthony Goldstein), as well as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12181042/1/Order-of-Mercy][anything Audrey Weasley]].

I love how it gives the author an opportunity to write practically original stories in a very familiar world as well as show the story from other POVs -- who know much less than Harry and the gang, might not have believed Voldermort is back, etc. Similar to rare pairings, super minor characters also force the authors to do more character development work as opposed to falling back to old tropes like Leather Pants Draco or Death Eater Ron.
