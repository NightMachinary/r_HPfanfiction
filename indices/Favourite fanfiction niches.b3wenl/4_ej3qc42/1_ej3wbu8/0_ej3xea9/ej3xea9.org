Definitely would recommend picking it up again. It's by Taure, so of course it's good, and it's also one of the few fics that manage to capture the magical-ness of canon. Lots of fics have good magic, but some feel too mechanical, or too scientific, or just not whimsical and whacky enough (or sometimes too much).
