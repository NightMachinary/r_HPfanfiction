Overthrow the corrupt, incompetent, and malicious British Ministry of Magic

Not many fics address that topic, but there are some very good ones:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): The Trio and their friends finally had it enough and declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. They began with vigilante killings against Death Eaters who got off again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Grindelwald broke out after Dumbledore's death and offered to help Harry. Together they spread chaos and revolutions across Europe.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Badly traumatized and deranged Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan time travelled and killed off their enemies in droves. They even did the Goblins in, but failed to get Snape and Karkaroff...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2612901/1/][There's Always a Way]], linkffn(2612901): One shot written by the author of NOFP. A gravelly injured Harry hires a super assassin SI from America to take out those responsible for a tyrannical marriage law.

Finally, I greatly enjoyed the scene in CoG where Grindelwald burned those Ministry goons to ashes.
