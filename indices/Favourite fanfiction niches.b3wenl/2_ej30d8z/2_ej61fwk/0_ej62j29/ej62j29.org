Well, I'm not that pessimistic. The Epilogue is after all only a snapshot and only indicates that Harry and his friends SEEM to be doing fine.

I wrote an [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/][one shot]], linkffn(12925628), that is an interview of Harry for the Battle of Hogwarts's 20th anniversary. He's been playing totally hardball politics for decades and “very thorough with Voldemort remnants”.

I have written additional scenes that depict Harry & co no longer as innocent children and naive teenagers, but as hardened warriors with a big vindictive streak:

  [Ministry of Magic, August 27, 1998]

  Seamus: We can't do this? We can't do that?! What was that soulless motherfucker thinking? He thought he could hide behind that foul “I'm just following order, we have to follow procedures” excuse? You know what, if any of those Death Eaters got away because of that motherfucker and more innocents are harmed, I'm going to personally tear that motherfucker from limb to limb!

  Neville: Language, Seamus, Language.

  Seamus: Sorry, Neville. I shall rephrase it to “inbred soulless motherfucking Ministry minion”! It's not just that little piece of shit, there are a whole bunch of those inbred soulless motherfucking Ministry minions who still think they own this damn place. We fought, we bled, we suffered, and we died, and those shit think they can still order us around? It's about time we teach them a lesson!

  Ron (laughs out loud): That was bloody brilliant, Seamus. That felt so good! Sorry, Neville, I hope you take no offense?

  Neville: None at all, I and Seamus went all the way to hell and back. We understand each other perfectly well, although I certainly wouldn't express myself that way in front of Kingsley. But Seamus has a point, there are still too many from the old Ministry, with their arrogant and corrupt attitudes. Kingsley might have cleaned out the Auror office, but it's only a part of the DMLE. We need to change that, and soon.

  Harry: Which means more politics. I hate that. I thought we had it after the Wizengamot was purged, thanks to your gran and Molly of course. But the rot in Ministry goes far deeper than my worst imagination. They weren't just forced into serving Voldemort. They did it willingly!

  Dean: We can't be too reckless though, or else we might face a full-fledged rebellion.

  Seamus: I say bring them on, lure them into the open, and then we will deal with them like we did with the Carrows...

  Neville: Seamus!

  Seamus: Oh, sorry Neville. I'm really really sorry this time.

  Harry: What did you do with the Carrows?

  Ron and Dean both turning their attention on Neville and Seamus.

  Neville: I think this will sooner or later come out. Seamus, do you agree that we should tell them the truth?

  Seamus nodded.

  Neville: Good. After you three went to sleep, we remembered that the Carrows were still tied up in the Ravenclaw Tower. So I led scores of DA members and we tortured them into pieces of vegetables. Then we killed them and explained that they were killed trying to escape. I'm not proud of this action, but I have no regrets. For what they did to hundreds of my fellow students, they totally deserved it.

  Ron: Bloody Hell!

  Seamus: Neville, it's not only you! We all agreed, especially Ginny...

  Neville: Seamus, what Ginny did is not our right to tell. Harry can ask her directly.

  Dean: Why didn't you call me to join the party?

  Neville: You were asleep as well, and Luna said not to get you involved.

  Dean: Luna was part too? Why did she leave me out? I have every reason to get back at them!

  Neville: You have to ask her, Dean. Luna cares very much about you, and she certainly had her reasons.

  Ron: You have my support too. Those two totally deserved it. I'm glad Ginny had her revenge. It's a pity Mum got Bellatrix too quickly. Harry?

  Harry: I certainly can't blame you, since I crucioed Amycus Carrow for spitting on Professor McGonagall.

  Others: You did what?

  Ron: Wow, I never knew you had that in you, Harry! You got Cruciatus to work on your first try?

  Harry: No, that was my second attempt. I first tried to cast it on Bellatrix in the Department of Mysteries, after she had murdered Sirius. It didn't work, and she taunted me by saying that “I have to mean it!”.

  Harry: Now that I remember it, Ginny did feel somewhat off when I met her in the common room after waking up. Does anyone else know?

  Neville: Professor McGonagall knows. Although she disagrees, she understands us.

  Harry: We will need a full pardon on all of our actions against Death Eaters during the War, and we will need significant freedom of actions against them in the future.

  Ron: Does that mean you want us to use Unforgivables?

  Harry: Maybe not Unforgivables, but lethal force for sure. During the Final Battle, they were throwing every dark curses at us, while we mostly answered with Stunners. A simple Rennervate by their fellow murderers meant they were back in business. It was criminal. We would have lost far fewer if we had fought back more effectively.

  Harry: Remember, we had Doholov and Rowle down in that Cafe, and we let them go. God knows how many more Muggleborns, Muggles, and Hogwarts students they had murdered afterwards. Remus was killed by Doholov, and it was my misplaced mercy that Teddy lost both of his parents. I should have listened to you then, and killed them on the spot.

  Ron: No Harry, you can't blame yourself for that! Dolohov murdered them, not you! Besides, Voldemort had my whole family as hostages, and if we had killed them, he might have retaliated by killing my family!

  Harry: Maybe. Maybe it was the right decision on that night, for us. But then during the Final Battle, we also had Greyback down after he mauled Lavender. Why didn't we put him permanently out of business there? Why?

  Neville: Because we were students then, not trained killers. They failed us, so we had to step up to do the dirty work. The Ministry, the whole lot of them, they all failed us.

  Seamus: Damn right, Neville! So what are we going do about those inbred soulless motherfucking Ministry minions?
