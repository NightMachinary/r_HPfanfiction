I like peggy sue/time travel , but not if they're presenting themselves as serious fics where Harry acts like a regular 11 year old, befriends 11 year olds, and does nothing except let canon come at him. I'm happy with that kind of stuff if it's a comedy, but if it's not then I generally want to read about a powerful and dangerously competent Harry actively making things happen.

 

I like the idea of Harry being transferred to a parallel universe, but I haven't found many that I really liked.
