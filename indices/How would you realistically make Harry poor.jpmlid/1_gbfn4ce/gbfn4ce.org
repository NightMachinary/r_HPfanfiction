  A simple "James and Lily spent all their money in the war" because they thought they would live and have a chance to earn it back to some degree.

I've seen this done before, though I can't remember the story in question. James spent all the fantastic fanon-level Potter wealth during the war, leaving Harry with enough to get through Hogwarts, but not much else. Whoever was taking care of Harry in that story (might have been Snape) was furious at him for not thinking of his son's future.
