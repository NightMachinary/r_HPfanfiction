I know what you mean it happens with me all the type, especially with common tropes, like, I must have read or at least started to read some dozens of stories about a trope (muggle-wank, indy!Harry, Bashing feast...) but when someone asks exactly for those instead of subversions or parodies of them I just draw up blank, like all of them were a single bad story that I can't remember the name.
