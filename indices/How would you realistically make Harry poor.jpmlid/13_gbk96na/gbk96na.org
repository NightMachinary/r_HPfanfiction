- Have the Gringotts cart crash or something. Harry wakes up in a Gringotts infirmary. Horcrux and abuse discovered. Shitload of gold to remedy the situation. That could substantially hurt the contents of the "trust" vault.
- Blame Dumbledore for the rest. I can't remember the fic, but Dumbledore left the Potter estate with the Wizengamott Inheritance department or something. Which was run by a Death Eater. They did their standard thing, selling stuff for dirt cheap to themselves. Pocketing loads of others. Investing in sham businesses. Donating to sham charities. etc.
- Blame Umbridge. Have her find the Main Potter Vault key. When she comes up with the "great idea" to seize the potter cottage. That would put even more motive behind the dementor incident.
- Attach a withdrawal limit for his trust vault. Sure, he has money, but he can't use it. Say he can withdraw 20/50 galleons a year for personal/fun stuff. X for necessities. X for caregiver (food/shelter) X for education. And X for supplementary education (secondary books/materials for further education. A Hermione fund). Second year would be hilarious. "I couldn't buy all of the Lockhart books, as it went over my Education Allowance."

That last one can be used to get the Dursleys to stop treating him like crap.
