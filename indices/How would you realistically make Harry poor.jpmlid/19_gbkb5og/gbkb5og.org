I mean... just have them be poor?

If you really wanted to get into it... bump James and Lily's ages by ten years (so they die at 31) and James beggars the family trying to hold on to the family home in the face of taxes and disrepair. Yes, I know, magic, but even so.

A more intriguing option would be to borrow the structure of something like Vanity Fair or the Grapes of Wrath. Vanity Fair has several basic options... there's the sympathetic but naive Harry, in which case you model him after Amelia, i.e. the family loses its money just after Harry finishes at Hogwarts (I guess we'd have Ginny as George, so the Weasleys get to be wealthy... and Hermione as Dobbin... or the reverse... or do it as slash, of course... Fred should be George, for the memes).

If you want Harry to be unsympathetic but understandable... he's Becky (with Ginny for Rawdon and Aunt Muriel as the wealthy Aunt... Hermione can be Jos, I guess). In this Becky!Harry case, Harry's a poor orphan who twists everyone around his finger, forces Rawdon!Ginny to gamble for a living, exploits the Weasley's good name to scam their landlord (seriously, the chapter's called something like "How to live well on nothing a year"), probably murders Hermione!Jos for the insurance, is a complete arsehole to their son (I think the line is something like "my son loves a stone")

If you want Harry (and James) to be unsympathetic and to die part way through... he can be George... with Neville as Dobbin and James gets to live on as Old Osborne.So, the basic thing here is that Harry kind of likes Amelia!Ginny and we'll go with Dobbin!Neville again (Hermione can be Becky and Ron Rawdon... although Rawdon and Amelia aren't related so Ron can be Jos and... screw it, Draco!Rawdon works). Anyway, James and Arthur arrange for a match between Ginny and Harry, which is a major reason why Ginny is completely into Harry. Anyway, Arthur goes out of business, James tries to break the match, Harry's already pushed things to the point of dishonour, Neville loves Ginny but advises Harry to make it right... so Harry marries Ginny, James cuts him off, Harry knocks Ginny up, goes off to Waterloo (er, the battle of Hogwarts) and dies (er, stays dead). Just extend the period of time where James cuts Harry off and Harry's busy flirting with Hermione.

If you want Harry to be sympathetic but also a jock... he can be Rawdon. You can do this one as a good WBWL concept because you just have Harry's older brother inherit everything while Harry's completely earnest affections for Becky!Ginny cause him to be disinherited by.... I guess, Uncle Vernon (who, previously, liked him)... or maybe it's a rare fic where Petunia and Lily's parents live or something.

Incidentally... if you're interested in the pureblood society stuff but aren't overly interested in the Potter seat on the Wizengamot, Vanity Fair is a good model. Of course, it also works if you are interested in the Potter seat on the Wizengamot trope.

The Grapes of Wrath option is interesting... you start the fic off with Harry's release from Azkaban into a wizarding depression (dust bowl). And then it basically never gets better.
