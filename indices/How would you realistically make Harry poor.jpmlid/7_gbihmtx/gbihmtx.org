Or just use the fact Harry is an unreliable narrator. What looks like an amazing fortune to a neglected 11 year old could just be a modest bank account.

Or, if you don't want to make it that, you could easily have what Harry has to be modest in the wizarding world. Even the Weasleys have more than him! He just doesn't know it.

(Since the wizarding economy is mostly undefined, you could do this a couple of ways: For example, magical real estate could be *#$*$ expensive to keep/maintain from our eyes, thus what looks like a fortune is really just a modest amount. Since Harry isn't paying for his own lodging, he doesn't have that on his finances).

This is, of course, just framing him as not having a lot of money. If you want him to have to act poor during his school years, you need to give an external pressure he has to find money for: Tuition, Taxes, Debt, whatever.
