If you're writing a fic you can just make Harry being poor a fact and go from there. Harry says he has no money and Hagrid instead of saying

'nah you're loaded',

comes back with

'That's true, some asshat bombed your house, you are the proud owner of some second hand clothes and a pair of broken glasses. Don't worry, the hogwarts orphans fund will give you just enough to get all your school supplies second hand.'

â€‹

That being said, an option is that the goblins trick Harry into spending all his money on useless services with exorbitant fees.

Just picture your usual indyharry Gringots scene except the goblins are playing the cocky 11 year old. Every 'service' they offer is basically a scam with a very large price tag. Six months of 'managing his finances' later they've perfectly legally siphoned everything out of his account and all Harry has left is his canon trunk of school things and the clothes on his back.
