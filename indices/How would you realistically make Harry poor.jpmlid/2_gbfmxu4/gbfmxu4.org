Let's say that the Potters' 687 vault really is the only one; there are none of those fan-made extra vaults and we disregard whatever's been said in Pottermore. Then we treat it like a savings account in real world banks, where money gets deducted annually then monthly if it's just sitting there, meaning no transactions (deposits or withdrawals) are being made. The account may even be reverted back to the state due to dormancy, like it is explained here: [[https://www.mybanktracker.com/news/inactive-bank-accounts]]
