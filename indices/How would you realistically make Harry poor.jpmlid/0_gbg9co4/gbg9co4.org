It depends on how AU you are?

It also depends on what kind of plot you have. Generally, yes, it is vastly more entertaining, satisfying and just makes for a story better all around to have an underdog (anti)hero who fights against the odds, starts with nothing and ends with everything.

Some random ideas:

- In a world where James and Lily aren't heros, but traitors, the Ministry seized their assets for compensation. Harry got moved to the Dursleys because literally no one wanted to take in their spawn, and he enters the world broke and disliked.

- In a world where everyone thinks Harry died, the Ministry seized the assets as part of a law declaring without heir, they are the default beneficiary. It was intended for Death Eaters, but the Potter fortune got caught up in it. Harry enters the world broke, and the Ministry desperately does their malicious best to cover it up and keep Harry marginalised, because they are (still) cash-strapped, after the war, and can neither return the money nor compensate him in other ways. It's a rather nice plotline with a ready antagonist. There's good a Slytherin!Harry with it.

- In a world where the Potters simply /weren't rich/ Harry enters the world howevermuch-broke-you-need: The Potters couldn't work, and going into hiding costs money. So there is nothing/little/modest amounts left.

The last is probably the easiest if you want to change nothing else from Canon; as you note, we are never told how much money he's got exactly, so you can always say that while it /looks/ like much compared to the Weasleys initially, as opposed to them, he's not adding to it earning money, and therefore has to run an equally tight budget if he wants to make it through Hogwarts.

.

Note I didn't add anything with Dumbledore. I just don't think you can make that plausibly work (as evidenced by the fact that a lot of those stories don't even try, Dumbledore steals money for no reason, just to show how evil he is.)
