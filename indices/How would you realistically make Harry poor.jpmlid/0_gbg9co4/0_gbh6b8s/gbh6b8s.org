This is, in fact, the law in very nearly every jurisdiction on the planet. /Bona Vacantia/ is a fairly common name for it - 'goods with no owner'. Such goods revert to the crown/state/government/local lord/temple of whoever.

It's part of my problem with the 'vaults unclaimed since the founders' times' trope: uninherited property just /doesn't/ get left laying about like that.
