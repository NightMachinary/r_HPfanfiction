I can see the goblins waiting a few years after they got notification of the death of the last owner and then not bothering to let the vault rental fees make the vault dwindle away to nothing, just clearing the thing out and renting it to a new customer. Someone posted elsewhere on this thread about the whole dormant accounts thing: in the real-world banking system they don't even need a notification of the account-holder's death.
