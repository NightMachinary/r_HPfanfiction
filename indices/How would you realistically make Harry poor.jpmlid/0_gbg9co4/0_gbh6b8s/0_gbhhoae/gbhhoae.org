Granted, it might be an issue of getting that law to work. In a world where "assets" are either in a Goblin vault, or in a manor that can be arbitrarily protected, a law that says "it's ours" is nice until you have to actually try and get the stuff. So in theory, I can see random old vaults just getting dusty with no one touching it, if the Goblins just shrug and point the Ministry workers to doors that suck them into the vault if they try to open them.

That said, the "Founders' Vaults" trope is still terrible.
