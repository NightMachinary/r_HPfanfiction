After finding out he has his own money, Harry goes on a good old Diagon Alley shopping spree: solid gold cauldron, seven-compartment trunk, fancy clothes (that he'll grow out of in a year). The shopkeepers happily offer their most expensive products, and Harry, never having been taught to be responsible with money, buys everything.

When Malfoy's father buys broomsticks for the Slytherin Quidditch team, Harry does the same for Gryffindor just to spite him.

Before he knows it, his vault is empty, because what looked like a lot of money to an 11-year-old is actually not that much.
