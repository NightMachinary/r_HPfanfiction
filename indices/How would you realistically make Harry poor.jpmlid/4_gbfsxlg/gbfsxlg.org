  James and Lily spent all their money in the war and ubiquitous Dumbledore thievery

These are the most common, but I've never seen any sort of explanation and I don't think there's a good one, tbh. Dumbledore is an alchemy brainiac and has access to Nicolas Flamel as well as the Philosopher's Stone. And I just don't think it's believable James and Lily blew through a fortune in ~2 years.

You could have someone hand Petunia Harry's vault key because they think she'll use the money to care for Harry, but she just ends up converting to pounds and placing them in her/their account.
