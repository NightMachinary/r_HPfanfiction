Well, yes. And that's Pottermore. If you look at the books (and only the books) the only indication that Harry has money comes from glimpses of inside his vault. Actually, when examining the firebolt at the start of book 3 Harry says "and what was the point in emptying his Gringotts vault for the firebolt when he had a very good broom already?"

That indicates that Harry does not have unlimited wealth.
