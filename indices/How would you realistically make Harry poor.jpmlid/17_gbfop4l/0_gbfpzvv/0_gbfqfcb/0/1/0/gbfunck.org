Harry is thirteen and the Firebolt is 'price on request'.

So a. he likely doesn't exactly have the best idea of financial scale and b. /he didn't know how much the Firebolt costs/. He is assuming that buying one would empty his vault, we don't know whether or not that's correct because we /never/ find out how much the Firebolt cost, only that Sirius was able to buy one and still have 'a reasonable amount of gold' left over.
