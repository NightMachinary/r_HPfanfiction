State Schools get government subsidies (the Muggle UK government spends about £90 billion a year on education) or what a teacher friend informs me is called 'Philanthropic Giving' (like our version of the US Alumni Donations - reached about £1 billion a couple years back, apparently), and at the end of the day, they probably don't have a significant amount of expenses. They have greenhouses to grow ingredients, things at the quill and parchment level can be conjured, the furniture has probably all been there for longer than the entire teaching staff has been alive, etc.

They'd only really need money for the big magical stuff, and there's some idea that they either don't have enough money or can provide for themselves for some of that too. They waited for their mandrakes to mature instead of buying someone else's potions/mandrakes, didn't they?
