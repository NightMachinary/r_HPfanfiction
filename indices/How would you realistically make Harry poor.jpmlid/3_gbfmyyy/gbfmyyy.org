I've seen the Ministry fining families and when harry assumes his head of the family, the fine is activated which takes most if not all of his vaults.

I've also seen the theft angle from either Dumbledore, Molly Weasley or her children and once even the Dursley family as well.

You could do a duel and have Harry lose, therefore losing everything to the winner.

Could have Harry declared dead by the Ministry and then they claim the funds as spoils of war.
