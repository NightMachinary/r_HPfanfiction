The story Faery Heroes by Silently Watches in a note at end of chapter 2 discusses their ideas on the exchange rate.

"A quick note on the exchange rate. Rowling said that a galleon was equivalent to five pounds; she also said she was bad at math. From the only item we get a price for that has a nonmagical equivalent (the Daily Prophet in Book 1, which costs five knuts), I calculate that a knut is 10 pence (author switched to US values), a sickle about £3 and a galleon about £50. The Twins "life savings" of 37 Galleons, 15 sickles, and 3 knuts would be just under £1900, while the tournament prize is £50,000. Suddenly it makes a hell of a lot more sense why students would be willing to risk life and limb in the Triwizard Tournament to begin with.
