I can't remember the fanfic author at the moment but in his fic he discussed his rationale for the exchange rate he used. It started with knuts and the cost of a newspaper and then considered the wand and the cost of a small car. Eg one time purchase that lasts for the rest of your life. With the rationale that most witches and witches only ever have one wand.

I think he used 500-1 (which seems way too high when you consider the other items that are purchased). Well one thing this does do is prove that JKR did not lie that she is bad at math because the various prices folks pay for things in the books make no sense when you compare them side by side.

I would say that it probably be in the 50-100 to 1 range. But then the Weasley's joke wand at 5 galleons makes no sense.
