5-1 seems way too low, eg if we take wand prices, 7 for 1 that is 35 a piece, add to that if it's several wand makers and Olivander is the "premium" one, and there is 40 students each year, he earns basically nothing when considering production cost + storage fees.

A wand costing 35 pounds is a steal, i reckon its more like 50-1, a wand should be fairly pricy
