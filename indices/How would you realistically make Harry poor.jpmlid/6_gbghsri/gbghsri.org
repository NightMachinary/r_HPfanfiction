Someone used the image of Harry's vault and calculated the minimum number of galleons that are in there. (Considered the minimum because not sure the image showed the complete vault).

Those calculations resulted in 50,625 galleons. If you agree with JKR's 5 pounds to the galleon exchange rate that means he "starts" with Â£253,125. Obviously more if you believe JKR's rate of 5-1 is to low.
