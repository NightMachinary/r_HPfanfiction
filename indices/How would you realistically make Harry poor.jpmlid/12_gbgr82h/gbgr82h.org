Basic evil bank shenanigans:

  Griphook grabs Harry's wrist and drags him up to the center of the doors, indicating Harry should place his palm on the oval stone at the center. Doing so, a brief flash is seen, and then the great doors swing open. Within, everything is dark.

  Harry: “Griphook, a little help with the lighting?”

  Griphook: “One galleon.”

  Harry tosses the coin towards the goblin who snatches it from the air with the skill of a professional Quidditch Seeker.

  Harry: “Are you overcharging me?”

  Griphook: “Yes. /Activate sconces/.”

  Torchlight flares to life surrounding the chamber from 16 separate wall sconces placed around the room. With the lights fully aflame, Harry and Moony take a look around at the contents of the Potter Vault.

  Harry: “I don't understand.”

  Moony: “It's all paper.”

  Moony reaches down to pick up a parchment laying on the floor.

  Moony: “This is a certificate for 40,000 shares in a magical flying carpet corporation, dated 23rd November, 1982.”

  Harry: “Aren't flying carpets banned in Britain?”

  Moony: “Yup.”

  Harry: “Griphook, is there a way to get an assessment of the current value of the contents of this vault?”

  Griphook: “Two galleons for the answer.”

  Harry: “Fine.”

  After Griphook pockets the two coins, he smiles.

  Griphook: “You may have the clerk of courts evaluate the paperwork for review of contracts to look for improprieties, but at this time, there is no value in this vault. Except perhaps as insulation or kindling.”

  Harry: “No value. Griphook how is the Trust vault sustained?”

  Griphook: “One galleon.”

  Harry: “I'd ask to run a tab but I doubt my funds will hold out.”

  Griphook: “You're not as dumb as most. Your Trust vault is renewed to a level of 50,000 galleons every 1st of August from the contents of this vault. As this vault is in arrears, you have been refilling the Trust vault from a modest loan for the last 8 years, interest set at a forgiving 3%, compounded monthly.”

  Harry: “If I were to put the money from the Trust vault back into this one...”

  Griphook: “We can process that request for a 1% handling fee, as you do not have financial control of this vault yet. As it stands, your Trust vault will be replenished with additional loans until you have the authority to change that arrangement and order it so.”
