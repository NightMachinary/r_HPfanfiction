  Also, go just a little bit deeper. Write conflict that doesn't exist in the books. Set up trials and quests that take place instead of the ones that take place in canon. A different, better Dumbledore wouldn't use the same stupid puzzle that Rowling thought was sufficient in a children's book.

Seconded on this one. Even if you avoid all the tropes and crappy aspects of a "manipulative Dumbledore," you have to, have to, have to set up new obstacles. Canon rehash is probably the single most uninteresting plot you can write and honestly makes zero sense, because if you start changing key aspects of the stories, the future changes too. Canon is a set of interlocking plot-threads and changing a major character means that you can't wind the threads back together again without the story seeming completely contrived. So, you need to build up a plot from scratch that doesn't follow the stages of canon, but also doesn't diverge so far as to break the reader's belief in the events that are happening.
