It's also necessary if you have a tendency to bash. Often, I find that fic authors take the character's motivations and traits and misinterpret them, and even if they don't /try/ bashing, they end up making the characters do something stupid. The best advice I could give someone trying not to bash in a story is to make the characters into something we can like, and that means creating adventures that expose different sides of them than we see in the book.
