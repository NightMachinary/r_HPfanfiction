The problem is that you try to make him manipulative, but you do this by modifying the same tropes that bashers use. Don't make him fight tooth and nail for his greater good master plan if it isn't immediately and obviously a good outcome (like ridding the world of voldemort forever with very few casualties, or something). A master manipulator would not drop hints, rather, you'd expect to see a series of /very/ subtle coincidences that pile up. Also, you have to understand: if Dumbledore is a master manipulator, then Harry Potter would /fall for it/, regardless of the circumstances he grew up with.

What you've told me so far seems to be indicative of this, but be careful not to define yourself with the things others use. Who says Dumbledore is controlling the Weasleys or Hagrid? I mean, his parents seemed to be pretty chummy with the two of them.

Also, go just a little bit deeper. Write conflict that doesn't exist in the books. Set up trials and quests that take place instead of the ones that take place in canon. A different, better Dumbledore wouldn't use the same stupid puzzle that Rowling thought was sufficient in a children's book.
