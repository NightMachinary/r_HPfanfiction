I think a manipulative Dumbledore would know that the best course of action was to be open and honest with Harry. Tell him that his father couldn't stand Slytherin, that Voldemort was a Slytherin, that most Slytherins hated his mother and considered her a mudblood, and that the current head of house Slytherin hated his father with a passion, that both his parents and their best friends were Gryffindors to the core, and then see if Harry has still any desire to join the snakes. Show him pictures of his parents in the Order, and point to the Weasleys, Molly's brothers, and the Longbottoms, and see if he won't feel a connection to Ron and Neville.

If he doesn't want Harry in Slytherin, Harry shouldn't be in Slytherin, unless Dumbledore is inept. He just has to tell him the truth, and Harry will probably rather leave Hogwarts than share his dorm with Draco and co.
