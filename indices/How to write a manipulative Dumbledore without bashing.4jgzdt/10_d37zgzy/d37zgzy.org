I will probably echo many earlier statements, and some of my points are rather obvious but here we go.

1.  Dumbledore needs to be competent.
2.  If you make him competent, it may be good to change some earlier canon.
3.  There should be reason to his actions.
4.  He should have some antagonist, make Lucius, Cornelius, Umbridge competent.
5.  Use backgrounds of characters (Dumbledore's guilt, Cornelius' past in Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, Malfoys' family history).
6.  Do not immediately reveal plans to reader, let him think that those are coincidences, and then reveal truth.
7.  Use narration to misdirect reader.
8.  Plan your story, so there will be long-time plans.
9.  Think what you liked and what not in other renditions of Dumbledore.
10. Crucial to all fics, do not slavishly follow canon plot, circumstances are different, so story will be different.
