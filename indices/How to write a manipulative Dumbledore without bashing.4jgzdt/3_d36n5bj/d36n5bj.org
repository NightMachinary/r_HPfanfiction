Can you elaborate on your plot? Its hard to judge whether or not a manipulation is good, if we don't know the ultimate goal.

In general you /have/ to get rid of the influence of normal manipulator!Dumbledore fics.

For starters, if Dumbledore wanted to shape Harry, he would have raised him himself. Its just that simple. First rule of Control is: If you want something done right, do it yourself. So if Dumbledore has a goal in his mind when he decided where Harry should be raised, he would consider something very close to himself. In the role of Grandpa Albus, he'd have the biggest chance to set Harry on a path of his choosing.

Also, if he truly is a master manipulator, Dumbledore would not include wildcards like the Sorting in his plans. Its just that simple. Easy plans generate reliable results. So in any of his plans, Dumbledore would include the possibility of Harry in any of the four houses.

Also, he wouldn't have Quirrel around. He gains nothing from it. Dumbledore has to know that one can easily break into Hogwarts, so laying a trap for Voldemort doesn't have to include the wildcard of his employment. If the plan doesn't require it, you cut it out.

ecetera, ecetera
