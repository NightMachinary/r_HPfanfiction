Your problem is basically this: Dumbledore is as powerful as Voldemort, but also has two advantages that Voldemort does not:

1. Everyone thinks he's good.

2. He has direct access to Harry.

All this means that you can't really write a Dumbledore who bears Harry ill will. Well, you can, but it would be a really short fic. There's nothing Harry can do. If Harry even manages to become aware of said ill will he's already far exceeded what you'd expect of him.

That's why evil Dumbledore fics are all bashing fics. The only way you can write evil Dumbledore and have a story is to seriously downgrade Dumbledore's competence i.e. bashing.
