Why would the will include something like "BTW Pettigrew is the secret keeper" ? I mean everybody assumes it would(every single fic i've read that had the will), but would it ? Magicals tend to lack logic, and common sense.

The entire switch from Sirius to Peter could easily be something done on a hunch a week before Halloween. I mean why would Voldemort go exactly then to kill ?
