A thing that i wanted to see in HP fiction, but never did is a logical way for Dumbledore to leave Sirius in prison all while being a nice fellow.

So imagine being Dumbledore and seeing that all these evil, evil Death Eaters bribe their way out of jail, and you have one that would get custody of HP. The same DE who would get custody of HP is also thought to be the right hand man of Voldemort.

So what do you do ? Seal the will, make sure Sirius doesn't get tried (nothing to bribe) and hide HP far away so nobody bad can harm him. (Security by obscurity)

It would also play right into why he directly never visited Harry as a kid, Dumbledore is an important man, and most probably under constant watch. So he leaves this to a person he trusts (a squib) and places his faith in the connection between Petunia and Harry (because they are family).
