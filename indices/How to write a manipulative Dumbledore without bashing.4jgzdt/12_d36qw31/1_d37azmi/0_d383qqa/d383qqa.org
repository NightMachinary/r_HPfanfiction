Maybe but if a complain that is addressed to a fan fiction also works against the original source than blame belongs on the original author.

We are given a source that in the begging tries to use child abuse as source of humor. (Look at these people, they are horrible and they are abusing 'the hero' don't feel bad when bad things happen to them. Simply laugh)

A very good manipulator Dumbledore might try to limit abuse by making sure there are regular CPS visits and inspections and good school budget. A *really* effective master manipulator would make sure that Harry grows up in a neighborhood with several other muggleborn kids so that Harry will have friends and a support group even at Hogwarts.(How to arrange this ? IDK, magic ? I am not manipulator so idk)
