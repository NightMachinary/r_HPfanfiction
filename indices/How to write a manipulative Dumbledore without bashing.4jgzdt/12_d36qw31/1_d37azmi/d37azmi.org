You forget that we know that Dumbledore can effectively vanish at a moments notice. If he doesn't want it, nobody is able to follow him.

Also, Mrs.Figg may be a bit senile, but even she had to notice the outside differences between Dudley and Harry. Clothes, weight,... . And it just makes no sense for Dumbledore to /never/ check in on harry in over a decade over his contact.

If we ignore the fact that Rowling needed a story, so she made it so, then we have to conclude that, at best, Dumbledore is horribly indifferent to the well being of Harry, even if he cares about his survival. A caring Dumbledore would eventually see the problem with letting him stay at the Dursleys. At the very least he would've investigated after being told so in Harry's first year.
