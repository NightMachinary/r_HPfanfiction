Well, first you have to detach yourself from ridiculous tropes like "Dumbledore wanted the Weasleys and Hagrid to prejudice Harry to Slytherin". Ask yourself what Dumbledore actually wants to achieve with his manipulations, and whether it actually aligns with anything he did in canon.

I think Dumbledore was manipulative in canon, but not much towards Harry - if you want a manipulative Dumbledore that is still good, make him be manipulative towards the Ministry, Lucius Malfoy and other enemies, in ways that are beneficial to Harry. You can say that Dumbledore tries to manipulate Harry to accept death, but that's something he already did in canon.

So answer me, /why/ do you want to write a manipulative Dumbledore? what's the point?
