The best way to do it is to write Dumbledore's thought process out for the reader - he wants to achieve some good end (and make it obvious it is some good end that he is trying to achieve, please don't say the words "greater good"), but show debate with himself on how to go about achieving that end while still maintaining the illusion of choice for whoever he is trying to manipulate.

This is what is done poorly in manipulative!Dumbles stories and what make me give up on them so often. A truly manipulative person plans in such a way that /everyone/ thinks they have a free choice in the matters at hand. Writing Dumbledore as anything less than a master at manipulation is lazy writing and a poor attempt at the trope.

A "good/light/benevolent" manipulative Dumbledore would be playing off the good qualities he sees in people - courage, self-sacrifice, and love. He would plan around those qualities of people to both get them into the situations he wants and to achieve the outcome he wants. A little setup and behind the scenes help from him is a plus as well, but it must be very subtle - not like dropping a sword in a puddle and using a patronus to lead someone to it.
