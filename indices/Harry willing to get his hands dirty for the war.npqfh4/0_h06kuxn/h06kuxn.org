linkao3(For Lack of a Bezoar) fits this request exactly, it's just canon Harry choosing to take a more ruthless approach after he loses his best friend to the war. There's some revenge torture there, but it's all aimed at Death Eaters and doesn't go into revenge porn territory. No Dumbledore bashing either.
