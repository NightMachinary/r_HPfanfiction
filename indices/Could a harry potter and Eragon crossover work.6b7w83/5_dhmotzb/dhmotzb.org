Yeah- any crossover can be done. Some just need more skill than others.

If you just wanna take Harry and drop him into Eragon like the fic someone else has already suggested, then it wouldn't really be difficult at all.

When you start trying to merge entire universes worth of lore it gets far more difficult. But I also find that, if pulled off properly, those are the /best/ fics. linkffn(Child Of The Storm) is honestly my favorite fic, and it's a full blown merger-crossover.
