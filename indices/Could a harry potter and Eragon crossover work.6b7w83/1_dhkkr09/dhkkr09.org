Linkffn(9622073) has a demension traveler MoD!Harry, and while the story hasn't been updated in a year, it is a good story. While powerfull, Harry and his magic isn't OP (I think, its been a while).

So in answer to your question, yes I think it could work, but it would depend on the wroter and how you wanted the different magics to interact.
