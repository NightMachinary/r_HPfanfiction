A random note: I do not think that people who did not have enough contact with platinum to recognise it as something not created by the goblins would be able to actually distinguish it from silver to the point where they'd give it a name rather than just think “well, it's silver”. Neither platinum nor silver generally get much ... hmm, let's say “utility-related use”, unless you are going into more modern technology, which means that it is unlikely people would actually feel the difference in any way, and appearance-wise platinum can look close enough to silver to consider it just that.
