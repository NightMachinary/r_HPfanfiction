It's not completely impossible, to be honest. If you had people who did not as of yet know about something and in the situation they saw it looked close enough to something else, it could be given a name based on that.

Now, while I doubt there are any stories where you'd have that happen to platinum as with metals it generally tends to be applied to alloys that are either not yet known or no longer popular and thus somewhat obscure, and I have no idea why would the kind of request that this post has be necessary for something, I will note that I did see people, maybe not in-universe but certainly in a discussion about it, refer to mithril from Tolkien's stories as “dwarven silver”. Sure, it may just be an outlier, but it's similar enough and there are people doing that.
