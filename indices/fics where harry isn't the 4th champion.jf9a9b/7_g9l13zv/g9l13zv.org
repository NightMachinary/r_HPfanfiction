the only one good fan fiction i know where harry isn't a triwizard champion, is some kind of book series on wattpad. each book represents 1 schoolyear (just like the normal books). The main character in the book is Harry's older brother. in part 4 he takes the place of harry in the election of the school champions.

I think it is really well written, and i really like the story! If you are planning to read it, i strongly advise to just start with the first book, since the main character experiences much more than 'just being Harry Potter's brother'. It might help you understand the whole story.

Title book 4 (the one with the championship): Prongslet and the olympian alliance Link: [[https://my.w.tt/1AEb4k03Lab]]
