I don't care one way or the other. Unless it is clear from the summary which character is dead or going to die. If it is, then it must be tagged so that people could filter easier.

I'm much more concerned with the summary and excessive tagging or deliberately under/incorrect tagging.

First one is rampant on AO3, every single character gets tagged even when they only have single line of text, sometimes not even that.

Second one could be seen in FFN, stories with just one or no characters tagged even when it is clear there is at least one other character who has a significant part in the story, romance stories that doesn't tag the pairings as pairings but as regular individual characters.
