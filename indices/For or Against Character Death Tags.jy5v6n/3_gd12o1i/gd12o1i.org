Apart from Hedwig (because people who kill Hedwig are the true monsters :D), I'd say no to specific character death tags unless it's a big enough part of the story that it'd be cited in story recommendations here ("Oh yeah, it's all about Harry's wife /Insert Name Here/ dying in /Insert Character Appropriate Death Event Here/ and how he deals with the aftermath as a single dad").

Otherwise, I'd agree to having general ones, yeah, but only as either 'main/significant character death(s)' or 'secondary character death(s)'. There's still more than enough of both types of characters that we'd have pretty much no idea who the specific character that died is, so we're not wholly spoiled, but it gives enough of a guideline that people who are bothered by one of the main lot dying (ie. Hermione, Ron, Harry, Neville, Minnie McG, Dumbledore, Voldemort, etc) can skip the fic.
