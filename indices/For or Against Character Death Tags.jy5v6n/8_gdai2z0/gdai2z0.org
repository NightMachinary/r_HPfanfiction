I like as many helpful and specific tags as possible. I like and dislike very specific things.

I think major character death is a good tag. Death happens a lot in the books so it's not shocking it happens in fanfic and doesn't ruin the surprise cause u don't know who. I might still read.

But generally no I do not want to read a romance where the other person dies at the end. I just don't. And I would like that to be tagged very clearly. Like if it is a Sirius/Remus or Sirius/OC I want to know if he is going to die because I don't want to read that.

Also like let's say there is a weasley twin centric fic that's gonna through the the battle at hogwarts I want know what the outcome will be because I don't want to relive George losing Fred again and again
