I feel like HP/GoT is severely lacking. I look pretty much every week for anything that's remotely interesting, and always come up empty. Like, I look at the list posted here and I can't say I like any of them, and a few of them are actively terrible. The best is probably "The Black Prince" but it's a super low bar, and I don't think I would even call it good. It got a rewrite, but all the reasons I didn't like the first version of the story are still there.
