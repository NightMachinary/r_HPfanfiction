I would recommend "Legend of the Gryphon" just for one thing: The story shows what happens when a HP wizard with their wand appears on Planetos: They do whatever they want because the rest of the world is powerless to stop them.

"The Winter Witch" also shows that, but to a lesser degree. Many stories have the HP wizard(s) join some faction in Westeros and accept the feudal system without any explanation for why they don't simply take over.
