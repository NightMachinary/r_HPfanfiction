I like linkffn(11132113)

It has Harry landing beyond the wall and surviving there with the help of his magic. Eventually he meets Wildlings and gets cozy with them. He quickly becomes their leader and ends up building a thriving city with them and his magic to aid.

It drags a bit, I admit. It is by no means a quick read. But I found it to be entertaining for someone who likes to read Harry solve the little problems of a community coming together and the bigger political problems arising with their success.
