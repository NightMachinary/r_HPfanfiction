I agree with you there. I really enjoyed the progression and detail of the city they built behind the wall and the usage of magic in mundane tasks. The way he was able to construct the city just really struck a chord with me I guess. Good world building is really hard to find.

My only issue with Last Lion of House Reyne is the pacing. In 140k words he really hasn't move the story along very far. Although I will admit I love the way he wrote Harry.

As for my fic?

That's because I haven't posted it to FFN yet. My Inheritance Cycle fic pushed back the publish date, it was just too much fun to write and felt like it was ready to go. This Saturday is when I'm aiming for launch. It's honestly coming together really well, I just can't get my first chapter to work right, it's driving me up the wall. I've got 20k words written and edited and the first big arc outlined. I'll PM you a link to what I have so far, feel free and read it (and roast me).
