Forgot about linkffn(The Last Hero's Heir by A Step into the Unknown)

Godric Gryffindor was contracted to stop the others the first time around. He did so, and in return the Children agreed to serve wizard for the next 1000 years. The children came to be known as house elves. At the end of the 1000 years, the house elves return to Westeros taking Harry with them. This takes place before Robert's Rebellion one of the few fics that takes place that far back. Great read.
