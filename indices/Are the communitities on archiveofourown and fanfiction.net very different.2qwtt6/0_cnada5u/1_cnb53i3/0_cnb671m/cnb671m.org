There's no hosting site which has a high amount of quality content, because hosting sites are open to everyone who wants to post a fic. You just have to trawl through and find good fics amid all the rubbish.

One useful thing is to go through the favourites lists of authors you like. Another tactic is to go through old recommendation threads on HP forums.
