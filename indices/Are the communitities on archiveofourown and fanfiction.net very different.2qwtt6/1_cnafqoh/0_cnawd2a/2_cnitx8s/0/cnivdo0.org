Exactly. While there a ton of issues with FFN, I can't fault them for putting a limit on characters and pairings in the description. It solves the problem of mass tagging at least.

Trusting people not to tag everything is stupid, especially when if you /don't/ do it, you lose views because everyone /else/ does anyway.
