Archive requires a wait to sign up and start posting, which tends to lead to better quality fic since someone who is posting crap usually won't want to wait the few months it takes to get an account. It's also a site that is largely populated by tumblr communities and older writers, which tends to result in a lot of tumblr popular ships and general porn. In addition, the tagging system leads to porn because of how specific you can be to find the right 'market' for your fic if you're writing niche porn. So you get some FANTASTIC fic when you find the good stuff, like, some of the best you'll read sometimes because of sheer quality and in-depth characterization. But you're going to have to wade through a significant amount of porn to get there. Fanfiction.net on the other hand is a very old, very well known fanfiction site. Everyone who wants to try fanfiction hits it up at some point, tagging is basically nonexistent, etc. You're going to find much less porn because of it's restrictions, but also a lot more general crap because everyone regardless of talent is going to post there.
