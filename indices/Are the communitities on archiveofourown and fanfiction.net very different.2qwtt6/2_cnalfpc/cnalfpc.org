AO3 doesn't really have a community to speak of. It is an end point for people who use other services to talk. It doesn't have forums or even a PM system, so it doesn't have a good way to gather on-site. FFN has lots of forums and personal discussion tools, but few people you'd want to actually talk to as a sane adult.

FFN has anti-porn housewives patrolling it and lots of teenage crap submissions, whereas AO3 has no quality control or censorship whatsoever but also virtually no "edgey", AU, power-fantasy, forced slave harem, millionaire, real-world high-school, 8th grade writing level, teen drama fics.

I've written some straight porn on AO3 and gotten zero backlash from the mostly slash audience and writers and several individual compliments. So in that sense, it is better than the FFN community treats slashers. My M-rated straight action/romance fics have gotten a good reception as well. I strongly recommend it for explicit erotica and romance. Though it is still a little thin, the quality is usually quite high.
