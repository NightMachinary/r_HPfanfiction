There is some crossover, where people post on both sites (generally uncensored on archive and censored on fanfic, but otherwise, generally archive does have a bigger ratio of erotica (straight and slash) than other sites (at least for all the fandoms I care about to look up fanfiction for), the stories listed there are /generally/ shorter than on fanfic for some reason as well.

So, TLTR, yep.
