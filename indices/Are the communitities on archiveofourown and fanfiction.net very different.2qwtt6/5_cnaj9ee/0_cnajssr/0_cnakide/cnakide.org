No problem! :)

Personally I'm really proud of AO3, because it's something that came straight from fandom and is run by/for fandom as part of a non-profit organization. I think slashers probably have more of a vested interest in protecting their fanworks like this because we're used to being historically misunderstood and attacked by creators in a way that people who write het fic may not always experience. Although there's more of an overlap between het/slash fandoms than ever, so I think ultimately it's all fanfic and the difference is more about quality/experience than what pairings you write.
