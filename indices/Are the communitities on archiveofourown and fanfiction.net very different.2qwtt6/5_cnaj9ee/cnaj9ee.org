The basic difference is that the core of writers at the Archive (AO3) are long-time slashers. The idea of AO3 originated from slash fandom and the founders were all older slashers active on slash fandom on LiveJournal at the time. The older slash community on LJ generally consisted of fans who'd migrated away from FF.net completely and formed much more mature communities of writers/feedback/beta-readers/etc, or from even older fans who came from Usenet or late '90s mailing lists or sci-fi fandom--basically LiveJournal is what people migrated to when they "graduated" from FF.net. All the best fandom writing of the mid-2000s are still to be found there, though discovering fics there is much, much harder now that LJ as a community is basically over. Pinboard.in is probably your best bet to find great LJ fics. LJ fics are, again, primary slash, and the high quality is, again, due to the critical community that tends to form around slash and the generally older age of slash fandom writers.

Beginning in 2008 with the founding of AO3 and really picking up speed in 2010, when LJ started getting hammered by Russian political DDOS attempts, all of the LJ writers moved to AO3 and merged into Tumblr. That's why the quality of AO3 is better and also why it's so heavily slash. It was founded from slash fandom, and the vast majority of fandom activity on both LJ and Tumblr is and always has been slash.
