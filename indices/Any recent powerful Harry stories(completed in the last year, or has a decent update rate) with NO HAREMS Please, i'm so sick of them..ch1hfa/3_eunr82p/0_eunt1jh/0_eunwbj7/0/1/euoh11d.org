Haha, it's okay to vent out. I bet they have a targeted audience (Like other ships and tropes). There are very few fictions inbetween that appeal to everyone. If you don't like harems, then you have those who strictly avoid slash or Het fics. (I avoid certain Pairings and certain settings as well).

I usually find the best by filtering out all side characters and going by Favorites in ffnet or Kudos in AO3.
