I won't say anymore on this subject if you don't want. I was only saying why I don't like them in stories in general, and why I don't like the concept of harems in general. I was only explaining to tediuminahamsterball why I asked for stories without a harem. It was not meant as an attack on anyone, and if anyone felt it was, I apologize.
