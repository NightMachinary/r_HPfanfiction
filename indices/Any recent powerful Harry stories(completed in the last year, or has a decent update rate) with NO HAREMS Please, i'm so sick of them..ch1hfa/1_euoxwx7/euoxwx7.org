Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Strong Harry and Ron as aurors after defeating Voldemort a bit early, easily become the two best aurors but are still seen as rookies but they hunt down the remaining death eaters pretty easily, just the mysterious night nargle always escapes them, it's as if she knew them really well....
