It makes far more sense in my head for him to be making the most of the freedom given to him by Dumbledore's absence. Dumbledore was the only teacher not to trust him. The Hogwarts library is meant to be extensive and I suspect that there is a lot in there that concerns the Dark Arts, didn't Dumbledore say something about removing lots of them when he became head?

Simply I see Tom as far too selfish to involve himself in the war when he could be making personal gains at home. The idea that he wouldn't simply be raiding Libraries and the like, becoming a the terrifying monster he became doesn't compute for me. Maybe even using the chaos to sneak off to albania and collect the diadum. He was above other people's conflicts and if he was even close he would have observed it like an emperor in the colosseum. Watching others die for his own amusement.
