  if Grindelwald's minions were heavily populated by Muggleborns, as some speculated...
#+end_quote

I know you speculated in your original post, but otherwise who, though?

Grindelwald is the OG Wizard Hitler, and making it so that his army was full of muggleborns, even though they were to many wizards similar to how Jews were to the Nazis, just so Tom could have a 'legit' reason for being a mad, frothing-at-the-mouth racist really irks me.

Tom Riddle is - in canon - a rabid supporter of the blood-purity ideology nonsense, with a healthy dose of Slytherin superiority thrown into the mix.

If you want to give him an important role (as you described in your original comment - interfering with Dumbledore and Grindelwald's duel somehow, for instance), that's your prerogative.

If you want to somehow make Grindelwald - might I reiterate, /Wizard Hitler/ - field an evil army of evil muggleborns just to make Tom not an insane antagonistic character then you're gonna lose me.

I'm really enjoying /Limpieza de Sangre/ but even I can see it's a /huge/ diversion from canon-Tom, and without you rewriting the foundations of his character, trying to justify his insane racism in later life by making muggleborns the bad guys just seems cheap to me.

I mean, you do you, I suppose, but I wouldn't be on board with that particular idea.

  The upcoming FB movies should shine light on Riddle's involvements, and I suspect it could be substantial.

Also, if they have any sense I bloody hope they don't. If the FB movies /have/ to have some titanic struggle between good and evil in them, then they should keep it at Grindelwald and let that be that, rather than write in some convoluted events whereby a teenage Tom Riddle gets involved. It would just muddy the water and unless it was done really well, it would come off like bad fanfiction.

Honestly, it just seems like you want Tom Riddle to be this deep, nuanced character that the audience can sympathise with without addressing the key issues with his personality and actions that both define him and make the above aim an impossibility. Tom Riddle is damaged, perhaps even some kind of psychopath (if I'm using that term correctly). He's cruel, vindictive and murders and tortures for fun. He's not altruistic or noble, and I just don't think what you want to happen would actually happen with his character the way it is. Without addressing these issues - and thus making it an AU - a story describing his possible role in the war would have difficulty getting off the ground.
