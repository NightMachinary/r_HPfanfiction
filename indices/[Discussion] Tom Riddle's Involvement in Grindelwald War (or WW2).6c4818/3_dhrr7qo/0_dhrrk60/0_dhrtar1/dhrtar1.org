During war, operating independently, do you honestly think, he could have any effect? And that anyone Awouldn't know that another force was working? For the sack of purpose, lets assume he did. So he had an effect on either side. Now Dumbledore was searching about Tom Riddle's memory, don't you think Dumbledore would staple upon someone who was affected by Riddle's action? This someone probably wouldn't know who this mysterious force was. But Dumbledore was clever enough to put the clue in right spot.

  He could loot magical artifacts and trinkets off their dead bodies and abandoned homes. He could experiment and practice spells/rituals on people in war torn areas

He could do that without involving as well. And he did that. The thievery at Smith's prove that. The thing that he didn't know much about the Hallows aka Grindelwald sign, shows that he had little interest about the war. If he had, don't you think, as brilliant as he was, wouldn't he research about the origin of Grindelwald's sign? His target was collecting the founder's items and 'pushing' the boundaries of magic. Don't think he'd waste his time involving with the war unless he was sure about that he could gain something.
