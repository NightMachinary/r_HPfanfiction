Of course he would operate independently and secretly.

  He had nothing to gain to involve with WWII

He could loot magical artifacts and trinkets off their dead bodies and abandoned homes. He could experiment and practice spells/rituals on people in war torn areas, without arousing suspicion.

  He was way too arrogant to associate with either group

Not completely. First of all, he was British. Second, if Grindelwald's minions were heavily populated by Muggleborns, as some speculated, then he would fight them, in secret of course.

Also, I need to remind you that the Tom Riddle from 1944 was NOT the same compulsive-obsessive, super narcissistic psychopath in 1997, at least not that extreme. He could still put up a good show as the Head Boy from fall 1944 to Jun 1945. He still had enough charm to fool Hepzibah Smith in 1947.
