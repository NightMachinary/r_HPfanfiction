I don't think he was involved either with Grindelwald or Dumbledore or WWII Or any of known anti-Grindelwald wizards. His life before appearing as Voldemort rarely known. Remember that Dumbledore was collecting memories and rarely any known Tom Riddle's memory was found. Dumbledore probably asked Grindelwald and his people about Tom Riddle as well. If Tom had anything to do with Grindelwald, we would have known in 6th book.

Voldemort always was self-obsessed. He had nothing to gain to involve with WWII. He was way too arrogant to associate with either group. Unless it's about collecting a prize as Dumbledore put it, no, I don't think he was involved.
