I think about this probably an alarming amount and I I've come to two conclusions based off the very little info we are given in canon. I think WWII had 2 effects on Tom Riddle:

1. The bombs and general fear in London cultivated his fear of death. Remember that he was in a muggle orphanage with virtually no magical protection. Aside from bombs and war, there was a lot of sickness and misery surrounding the poor during this time.

2. He must have been at least somewhat aware of what was going on with Hitler, etc. and this fueled his hatred of muggles. They all treated each other like shit, from stigmatization to death camps (on the scale from mild to extreme). He may have thought Grindelwald had a good idea but looked down on him since he (along with anyone else on earth) would never be as smart and powerful as Riddle (in his head).

Other than that, I really don't think Riddle gave a crap about WWII. He found out he was a wizard in 1939(?) when it was just getting started, and since he could do magic, well, who cares about a bunch of muggles?
