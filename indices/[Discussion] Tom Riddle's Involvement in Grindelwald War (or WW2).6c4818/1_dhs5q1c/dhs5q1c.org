So, I believe that canon says/implies that Voldemort was dicking around in Albania for a substantial amount of time, after he killed Hepzibah Smith. Ostensibly this was to improve his magical knowledge. (As a side note, it might be interesting to have Albania and other Eastern European countries be the center of dark magic as a culture.)

Voldemort, while narcissistic and sociopathic, was also pretty pragmatic when one of his mental issues wasn't interfering. I cannot really see him fighting out of patriotism, and the idea that he would kill soldiers to steal valubles doesn't make much sense in terms of efficiency.

What he could do however, is grow his influence. Muggle and wizard fighters placed under the Imperious Curse, and no one would suspect, merely calling them "shell-shocked". It would also allow him to aid Eastern Europe, and grant him connections with unsavory elements through Europe. It gets even more interesting with the USSR. What does the magical Russian nation look like, and how would Voldemort have interacted with it? Voldemort himself rather favors a dictator approach, and takes a rather nationalist stance in terms of pure blood vs muggle born.

I could definitely see Voldemort as being politically opposed to the USSR, and if he did manage to Imperious Soviet officials, then at that point, we have to consider just how much magical Russia is under their counterpart's thumb. Because if he controls Muggle policy which in turn controls magical policy, he would have a great deal of influence on the Continent.

I don't have time to look at a timeline, but I could certainly see Voldemort using Muggle Russia to bring Magical Russia under his thumb, dominate and puppet a large number of the magical nation's, and then start a nuclear war to wipe out the Muggle superpowers, allowing them to rise and destroy the Statute of Secrecy, and conquer the world.

This is all speculation, and I don't have time to look at the canon or timelines to confirm this, or even make it plausible, I just thought it was an interesting idea.
