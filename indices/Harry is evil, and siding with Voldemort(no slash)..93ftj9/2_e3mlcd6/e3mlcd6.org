Hm...is it really evil if you side with the BGs to end a war sooner (less casualties, I mean who do you really need to take out to win the war for Voldemort? Dumbledore, Moody, Sirius and maybe Kingsley - Ron, Hermione and the Weasleys might not even fight if those are dead and Harry declares to be on the other side! But with those people gone the good side doesn't have any leaders left (Hermione and Ron can't run the DA for example because they are quite unpopular and aren't celebrities like Harry! No DA, no final battle (the adults would fail miserably without the DA backing them up!))...hell, Harry giving an interview to the Prophet detailing how the wiz-world in general and Dumbledore especially screwed him over? You bet many people would lay down their arms (well: Stop fighting, I bet they would not turn in their wands!))
