  Ronald Weasley gave a great yell as he shot out of his chains like a cannonball and went sailing through the air - straight toward the judges' table. As the judges scattered, the screaming boy smashed through the wood, hit the earth with a distinct /ka-boing/, and bounced into the Slytherin stands.

This is some next-level Ron bashing.

Edit for sarcasm: Get it, because Ron literally got hurt?
