While I think the basic idea of the Tournament-shenaniganry in the first chapter (asking Dobby to do it, sticking-charm a rock to the egg and float that out, do a switching charm...) is funny as heck, it does go on to have a lot of badfic symptoms...

- Lord!Harry kind of at its most insufferable.
- Harem-building - not just Harry, but Neville too according to the summary. I gave up before I saw Neville's.
- Dumbledore exploiting Harry for all he's worth, resorting to all sorts of crimes to try and keep Harry useful and dependent.
- The Weasleys being in on Dumbledore's plot in some capacity.
- Harry being OP magically (immunity to all mind-magic, which in this fic includes the Killing Curse).
