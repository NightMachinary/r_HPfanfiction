A few stories whose titles I can't remember used accio like that or in a similar manner. In one, Harry uses "accio heart" on Bellatrix during a battle (in Diagon Alley, I think). It doesn't come out, but the lurch against her breastbone stops it.

In another, he does an accio on his opponent's shoes to pull their feet out from under them.

In another, he and the Weasley twins are in Grimmauld Place and possibly drunk, and they start having Harry do things like "accio Snape's dark mark" and then accio various body parts of Voldemort, finishing with accio'ing the rest of him - by then, just a head and torso.
