Other than what's been listed so far, there's

- [[http://grangerenchanted.com/enchant/viewstory.php?sid=1819][Dangerous]] where Harry returns to wizarding Britain a decade later to discover that Hermione is the new Dark Lady.
- linkffn(Harry Potter Without Harry Potter by Nim-the-Lesser) has Hermione end up attending Durmstrang under false pretenses and becoming rather well versed in Dark Arts.

These two are basically humor/crack:

- linkffn(Agent Double O Hex by KafkaExMachina) has Hermione as a daughter of recurring Bond villains, and a mad scientist.
- linkffn(Do Unto Others Before They Do Unto You by SmallBurnyThing) is a crackish fic that does feature Hermione trying to take over the world.

Here are some that have issues that prevent me from recommending them without reservation:

linkffn(Darkest Witch of Her Age by darkrose0510) fits the bill; it's a bit emo, and almost certainly abandoned, though. No pairings, either way.

linkffn(Labyrinth by Kroontjespen) has a Riddle-like, but recognizable, Hermione coming to Hogwarts, with harry in tow.

linkffn(Remedial Lessons by SymphonySamurai) is a three-shot (a slightly overgrown one-shot) where Hermione takes a rather ruthless approach to helping Harry during OotP. (It is a Harry/Hermione 'ship.)
