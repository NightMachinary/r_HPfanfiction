I just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7159111/1/Blood-is-Thicker][Blood is Thicker]], and I liked it a lot. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5216059/1/Of-Elusive-Realities-and-Convincing-Facades][Of Elusive Realities and Convincing Facades]] is a fic I read a whole while back, so I'm not quite sure anymore what it was about but I recall her becoming dark. I'm a fan of dark Hermione fics but most are either unfinished or have her turn back to the light in the end.

In case you don't mind her turning back to the light in one way or another, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3743322/1/The-Bittersweet-Taste-of-Victory][The Bittsweet Taste of Victory]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6940202/1/Vengeance][Vengeance]] among many others (but these I favourited despite that).

There's plenty of fics in a dark atmosphere, where Hermione achieves her (mostly light) goals through less scrupulous means, but I don't think that's what you meant. In case it is, you might want to check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Dark-Hermione/8347/99/4/1/0/0/2/0/][this community]].
