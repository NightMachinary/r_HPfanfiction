Almost forgot: there's linkao3(And She Shall Reign... by BeastOfTheSea), a one-shot narration about Hermione taking over the world a la the Antichrist. YMMV, but it does have the following brilliant passage:

[[/spoiler][It was so blindingly obvious, in retrospect, that it stunned her that she had not seen it immediately after the final demise of Voldemort. What had Dumbledore left them? Ronald had been given an indulgence to save him from his own misguided behavior, Harry had been given a relic to encourage his martyrdom, and she - she had been given Dumbledore's own youthful inspiration. Clearly, he had meant her to succeed where he had failed. /Clearly./]]
