Pretty much everything by enembee and joe6991. I also extensively followed a very popular fic from the DBZ fandom (second of all time sorted by reviews) while it was updating, but that's not really relevant.

You know, it's funny. I will swear up and down that I am a huge fanfiction fan, but when I have to name good fics that I enjoyed, I'll always default to the same two or three.
