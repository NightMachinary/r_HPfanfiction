Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor. I usually enjoy raunchy stories like Black Comedy so I tried to like it, but I don't think I've ever read more than 2 or 3 chapters.

It reminded me of another story from the same author: Crack'd Mirror. I somehow powered through it despite not enjoying it much either. I guess it was the smut. It's neither hot nor funny, so I don't understand what purpose it serves. It was like [[/spoiler][uhh OK, Harry's fucking Luna in the ass for the 5th time this chapter, I'll just skim over the next few paragraphs]].
