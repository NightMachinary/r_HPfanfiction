Anything from Robst

*Harry Potter and the Wasteland of Time*: I don't hate it, but I can't enjoy it.

A popular fic I absolutely despise is *Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness*. It claims to be canon, but its characters couldn't be more OOC, and its plots couldn't be more implausible. [[/spoiler][Demelza almost strangled Neville to death because Ginny went to discuss DA with him in the middle of the night?! Snape tried to feed Neville/Ginny/Luna to werewolves in the Forbidden Forest?! Hagrid abandoned the three to die there because Snape ordered him to?! Victor Krum rescued Neville from the ministry execution chamber?!]]
