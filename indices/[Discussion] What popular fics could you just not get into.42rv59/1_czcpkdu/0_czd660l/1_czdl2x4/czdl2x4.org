I liked how dark it went, especially because canon is wildly inconsistent with that. I think if you speed-read you can skim over the bits that ring false. I particularly liked DAYD's portrayal of Bellatrix, although the Neville was a bit OOC.

Having said that, the bio of the author above and the revelation that they were a cult leader puts a different twist on it.
