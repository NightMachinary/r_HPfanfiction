I'm having a hard time continuing to read Denarian Renegade. It's well recommended, and for good reason. It's very well written, plus it has some great fight scenes. It's just... I really can't stand Harry. Spoilers incoming, I guess. I know he's had a demon attached to him throughout his childhood, and it would be unrealistic if he was normal, but it doesn't change the fact that he's a very unfun character to read about. It was good while he was alone or interacting with paranormal creatures, but now that he's at Hogwarts and interacting with real people it's been excruciating. He's just a nihilistic dick with no purpose or real personality. And then we have that Amanda girl taking his abuse with a smile. It was fine when they only interacted a little, but it's just cringe-inducing now every time it happens. Finally I just read Meciel casually suggest either killing Hermione's parents, torturing her, or engineering a plan for her to get raped. I know she's a demon, but it's almost the end of the first book and NOW we get the information that she's a sadist that has no problem hurting a complete innocent? I think I was totally justified in thinking she had at least some code, but I guess not. It would have been better to learn this sooner.

Anyway, long rant. I'll try to finish the book at least, see if anything changes.
