Oh, most of them. The ones that stick out the most are 'Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived' by Santi, 'Emperor', and 'Harry in the Claw of the Raven' - or is it 'Wit of the Raven'? Sorry, I can't remember. There might be two fics with those names, and I couldn't get into either of them, if that's the case. Makes me sad, because I like the idea of exploring Harry in other Houses, but I can never seem to enjoy any of the fics that try.

But yeah, I can usually see /why/ a fic is so popular, but not enjoy them and quit after a few chapters. I think I have weird tastes, though.
