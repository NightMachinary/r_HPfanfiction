Yes, I really didn't remember.... Can I ask why that's too perfect?

I didn't remember A) because it's been a long while since I tried to read them, and B) because I've tried a lot of other fics since then. I'm not good with names anyway, so that doesn't help...I once called the movie /Gone With the Wind/, /Name of the Rose/ for reasons unknown for a whole hour before I realized.
