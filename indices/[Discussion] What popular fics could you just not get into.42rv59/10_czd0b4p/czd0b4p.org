'Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived' by Santi

Its recommended everywhere on this thread, but I just could not get into it. I don't see the appeal, it wasn't a great story. It's characters weren't particularly great, and it's writing was below average (if you limit to fics that are actually readable. Otherwise every readable fic is in the top 10%, there's a lot of craps out there).
