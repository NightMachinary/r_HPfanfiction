Yeah, I noticed this forum and DLP tend to favour very specific types of stories. I once came across DLP's Potter Law and thought it would be a list of what not to do in a fanfic... and the first rule was basically keep it Harry-centric. I figured we were going to have very different opinions on what makes a story good.
