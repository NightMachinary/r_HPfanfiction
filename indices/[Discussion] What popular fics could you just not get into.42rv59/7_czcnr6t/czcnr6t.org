The works of Shezza are too, I don't know, Hollywoodish? shallow? I'm not sure why exactly I dislike them, but they bore me and I don't get what people find in them. Probably for the same reason I dislike Anime and video games.

A Black Comedy and Make A Wish are both highly-rated comedies that failed to draw one chuckle out of me. They only drew cringing and eye rolling. Same for the rest of the authors' works.

HPMOR and robst stuff are a given.

"The Sacrifices Arc" or whatever those Saving Connor stories are called are awful in my opinion.

"Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness" absolutely disgusts me, both because the story is terrible, and because the author did some fucked up shit and is a complete fraud.

"What Would Slytherin Harry Do?" annoys me because Harry is so not cunning or clever there, yet the author paints him as this ultimate crafty Slytherin and makes his retarded plans unrealistically work. His attempts at humor are also pretty weak.
