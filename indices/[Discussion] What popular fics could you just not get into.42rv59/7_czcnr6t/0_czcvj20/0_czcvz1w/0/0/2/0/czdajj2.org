I don't know how to break it to you but internet forums and the fantasy genre are independently attractive to mentally unstable people, and together are four times as much. Add in the escapism of fanfiction and you can get some pretty terrible situations. And people want to believe the best about people they care for, which generates sycophancy and denial.
