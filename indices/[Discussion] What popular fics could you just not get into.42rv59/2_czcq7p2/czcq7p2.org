Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness gets recommended to me a lot, and I've tried, I really honestly have, but it's just so ridiculous and awkwardly sexist. Northumbrian also gets recommended to me a lot and although I full accept he's a very talented writer there's something about his characterisations that rub me up the wrong way. His fics are good though.

Other than that I actually don't tend to read many popular fics. I think a large part of it is that I really love canon stuff. I have an appreciation for the creativity that comes from AU/unusual pairings and such, but they never really hold my attention that well.
