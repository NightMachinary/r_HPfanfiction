Everyone says this, but my utter hatred of that story had nothing to do with the writing style and long period between plot points and everything to do with the fact that every single adult in the book is an utter fuckwad. There's one competent teacher and even with her she gives the impression, every time we're speaking with her, that we're waiting her time. Even the Hagrid-esque game keeper isn't nice so much as "not actively trying to make us miserable". Do all the teachers die in a plague? (Preferably painfully)? I can think of little else that would incite me to finish that book.
