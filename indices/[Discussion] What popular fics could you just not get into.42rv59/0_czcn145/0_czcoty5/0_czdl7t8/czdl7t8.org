The first time I tried to read it, I gave it up after the first chapter. The second time I was determined to give it a second chance because everyone said it was great. Which it was - it's one of my favorites now, even if sometimes I just want to wring Alexandra's neck, haha. The world-building's awesome, and I love how magical america is also a melting-pot of cultures.

But of course everyone has different tastes, and there's nothing wrong with that, :D.
