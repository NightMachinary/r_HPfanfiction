I gotchu fren though this is a crossover of hp and the Addams family. Personally, I love this. The tone isn't angsty nor serious it's more like what you've asked for, or rather, it feels like the Addams.

In other words, Harry is adopted by the Addams family and fits right in.

There are 7 separate stories. The first one is pre-hogwarts (the link below) and it ends with the half-blood prince story (go check the author for this). It doesn't seem to have the deathly hallows though.
