I've thought about writing a story like this for a while.

A Daphne SI that goes full on about learning Dark magic and gets fuck up in the head because of it. Then proceeds to become an orochimaru expy(magical mad scientist searching for immortality)

But all of that with the typical irreverence and lack of concern that a lot of SI show and with a really bubbly personality.
