I would love to read this, my all time favourite SI story is in the Buffy universe. The protagonist is a vampire and eats people and kills demons but the tone of the story is so wholesome that it still hurts me that the author has abandoned it. Please let me know if you do start posting this.

Edit: The story I am referring to is Blood and Chaos by Aetheron, highly recommend it for a good fun read.
