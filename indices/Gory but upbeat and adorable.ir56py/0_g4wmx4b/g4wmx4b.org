Not sure it fits entirely but you could try [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19328290/chapters/45976822][The Archeologist]]. The cursebreaking somewhat fits although they also spend a decent amount of time at Hogwarts. It's not explicitly gory, and the adorableness to me more came from Harry being wildly unaware of his own power. It's complete though and very enjoyable.

If you haven't read it you could also try Make a Wish. It's very humorous, but death eaters routinely die in unpredictable and gruesome ways.
