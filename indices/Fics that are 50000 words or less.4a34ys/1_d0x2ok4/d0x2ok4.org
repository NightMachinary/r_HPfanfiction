There's a lot of leeway with your request, so the suggestions I've made kind of go all over the place in terms of genre and tone.

Some darker stuff first. linkffn(3375683), linkffn(11564067), linkffn(4269983) /Gaslight/, /The Last Enemy/, and /Anything but Slytherin/.

Then a /Harry Potter/ and /The Dark Tower/ crossover; warning for spoilers if you haven't read the second book series. linkffn(7158052)

/The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks/, a mystery fic with Harry and Hermione; semi-shippy, but not really the focus. linkffn(6243892)
