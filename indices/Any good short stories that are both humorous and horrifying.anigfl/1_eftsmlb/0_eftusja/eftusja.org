Brilliant---just finished it. And can I just say, out of the few bodyswap fics I've read, this takes the cake. The idea of getting into this particular situation is funny and lighthearted by itself, but the execution of the actual story was chilling and anxiety-inducing---in the best of ways. Thanks for the rec!
