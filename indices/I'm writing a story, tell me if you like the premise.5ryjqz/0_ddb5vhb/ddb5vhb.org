Whoops! I didn't leave much of a premise did I?

A young boy discovers his power and with the support of his parents begins his magical education underthe brightest headmistress since Dumbledore. But rumors of strange disappearances and magic unknown disturb the sleep of the wizarding world and the one closest to the truth behind them is a first year with an affinity for potions.
