Well, its still not that much of a premise. Its a summary and from that alone, I'd probably give it a go if someone recommended it on here, but I probably wouldn't click it when I see it on FFN.

For a feedback on your premise you'd have to expand on it a bit. I'd also work on your summary, give it a bit more urgency.

As a general thing: Of course, go for it. If you're already liking what you did, doing the rest is gonna be a blast. OC stories normally don't gather much audience, so don't be scared off by a lack of attention at first. Alexandra Quick had a hard time at the beginning as well.
