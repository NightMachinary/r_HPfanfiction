Blood's the classic answer, but I could also see bone as an interesting path to take, as it seems to follow naturally from the folklore around certain types of wood or certain stones being sources of magical powers. Muscle... I just don't /feel/ it, y'know? Seems more a sci-fi idea than a fantasy one, if I had to put it into words. As for bone marrow, there's little objective difference between that option and the "bone" one, save that the bone one is cooler because it allows for the bones of long-dead, but famously powerful, wizards to become much-sought-after treasures.
