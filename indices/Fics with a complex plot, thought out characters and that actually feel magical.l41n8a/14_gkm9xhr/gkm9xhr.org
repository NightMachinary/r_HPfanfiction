Accidental Animagus, of course, if you haven't read it. I found it better than The Arithmancer and quite a bit more creative.

Seconding Victoria Potter - it's really creative and probably the most polished recent Harry-centric fic I've seen. Really expands magic in an organic way and infuses it into the world.

Alexandra Quick does this similarly and IMO more originally, but it's an all-OC story set in magical America after the war, so I don't know if you'd love it. It's its own thing, not really either postwar or next-gen. FWIW it does fit all your initial criteria. Probably does the best job of capturing Rowling's magical atmosphere to the wizarding world, but in a very American context.

Pureblood Pretense series read pretty similarly to Arithmancer for me, fits all your criteria. Very long and in-depth. The magic is a little more structured and explained, but not by much. Quite AU.

Lastly, check out the Anguis series by Slide, it's set during the Second War and follows a bunch of really great OC Slytherin characters. Really well-written and canon-compliant as well, with a lot of subplots and a good job capturing Rowling's atmosphere.
