If your looking for a Snape fic with some damn good world building linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower) is the way to go. It's brilliant and is bursting at the seams with magic lore and plot and politics and everything else its incredible.

Linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down) is also a fantastic adventure story with an amazing world and plot and drama and humour. Just brilliant. Very creative!
