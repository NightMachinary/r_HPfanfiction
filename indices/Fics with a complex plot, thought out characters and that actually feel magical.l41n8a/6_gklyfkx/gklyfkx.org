Mine isn't finished yet (I mean it is 210k but not finished) but it has multiple complex characters who drive the story and focuses heavily on the magical world apart from just Hogwarts. If you're also a bit tired of Harry, that works because it is a prequel that does not focus on the trio. It explores a lot of magic outside of just dueling too.

IDK shameless self promotion but it seems to fit what you are looking for. I update about every five days and the ending is already planned, too. I will let you know if I stumble across anything similar too! I like these types of fics.
