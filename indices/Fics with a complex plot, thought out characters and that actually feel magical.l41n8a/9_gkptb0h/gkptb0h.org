The first fics I ever read were written by some author called HarryWriter who tried to pass his year 5 and year 6 fics as bootleg versions of JK's books 5 and 6. I believe that the fifth one was also called "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" and the sixth one was called "Harry Potter and the Ring of the Ancients". Maybe because I was 12 or 13 when I read them they seemed really cool but if I recall them well they were written pretty much in the same spirit as the original books with lots of mystery and adventures. It also included a lot of original magic such as a rare ability to turn into multiple animals and/or combine their most useful features into one shape or the wizard equivalent to the internet located in a different dimension where an oracle had all the existing knowledge from the world. The thing I didn't like much about it was that it had very long anime-style duels. Also unfortunately can no longer find them online although there might be some people who have a PDF/word copy of it on their drive.
