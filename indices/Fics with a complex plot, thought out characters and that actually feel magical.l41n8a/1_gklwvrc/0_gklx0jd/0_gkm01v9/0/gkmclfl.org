I love The Prince of Slytherin, but I have a few notes I like to give people when I recommend it.

- i didn't like the prologue, and it stopped me from reading it for a while, but once I got past it I was instantly intrigued.\\
- yes, James and Jim start out really shitty. They do get better.
- I found that the story really picked up in book 2. If you're finding it just “okay” throughout book 1, I'd recommend you try sticking it out until then. It has my favorite Lockharts of any fic I've read.

(Edit in case this wasn't clear - i am not the original commenter of these recs)
