It's not complete but it has 53 chapters so far and around 480,000 words (give or take)

In this Harry is anctually a girl named Belladona Pandora Potter (-Michels) and has a twin sister named Prunella.

Lily and James were not killed and Bella is the GWL but they are also incompetent nutjobs and think that Bella is a squib that bullies her sister for not having magic (even tho they're one year of age) and give her to the Dusley family who later give her to an orphanage.

She's also a piano and skating prodigy and a Slytherin.

Honestly, I like it more than the cannon
