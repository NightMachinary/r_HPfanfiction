a. Abused by James and Lily. I never got this logic. They died for their child in canon. Why would they abuse him if they got to live?

b. Chick-magnet Harry. Every girl (every single one of them) finds Harry completely irresistible and drops in bed with him the moment he speaks a word to them (sometimes, he doesn't even has to say a word). Who cares if he already got another one by the next morning?

c. Submissive Harry. It's one thing to be submissive and another to be this snivelling weak martyr-like Harry they write about. Self-respect is over-rated anyway.

d. fem!Harry. There are good fem!Harry stories and there's so-pure-pretty-powerful-and-completely-OP fem!Harry (and most of the time, she has this edgy name like Nyx or Elvira)
