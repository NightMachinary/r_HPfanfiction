B) Canon Harry was indeed a potential chick-magnet, it's just that he wasn't interested in being one himself. There were a significant number of attractive girls willing to sleep with him if he opened up just a little, such as Cho, Ginny, Parvati, Romilda, and potentially Luna. He could turn the DA into a cult if he really wanted to, as its members were already extremely loyal. And I believe Hermione loved him too. H/Hr didn't work in canon not because of Hermione, but because of Harry.
