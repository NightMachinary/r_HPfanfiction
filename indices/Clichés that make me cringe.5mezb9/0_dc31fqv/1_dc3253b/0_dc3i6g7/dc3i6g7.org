Not sure what little boys you're familiar with, but the little buggers I went to school with were already pretty lewd as early as 5th or 6th grade. XD They had definitely started to notice girls by that age.

As far as "is this something I want to read" I guess that depends on the whole point of the story? Like I said, "romances" of this type have been depicted in movies and age appropriate books for decades. My Girl is the example that jumps to my mind, but I know there were tons of others. I know I'd rather read a story about a cutesy puppy love romance than have to endure 11 and 12-year-olds who behave too young, which is another thing I see all too often in fanfiction.

As far as the kids having more "adult" romances, I agree with you. I don't find anything at all appealing about that. But there's a reason schools start teaching sex ed to kids around the 10-year mark. That's the vague start of when boys and girls start to notice each other.
