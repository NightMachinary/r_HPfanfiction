  12 year olds are not old enough to consent, no matter how mature they are.

Depends on where you are. In the Philippines for instance 12 is the age of consent. In some areas it is even lower (Afghanistan for instance). The idea that you can't consent until 16 or 18 is very much a cultural construct, not a fact. We have no information that I'm aware of how magical society in england sets such rules.
