It happens, but an elementary school aged kid having sex with (presumably) an adult is not normal, but a crime. 12 year olds are not old enough to consent, no matter how mature they are.

A lot of countries have laws to make teens having sex with each other legal (mostly so that one 13 year old doesn't commit a crime by having sex with another, consenting 13 year old), but most also have age limits in place to prevent exploitation of children.

However, while it's normal for some kids to have sex while they're in their early teens, it's also normal for people not to have sex until their early twenties or later.
