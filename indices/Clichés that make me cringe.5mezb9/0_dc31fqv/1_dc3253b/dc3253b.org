Yes, this is sometimes the case.... I still think it is bizarre, especially because the vast majority of boys don't hit puberty until early teens. But as a (presumably) adult, is this really what you want to read? Is this what you want the story to focus on? And how in the world is this relevant to anything in the plot? As a 20-something adult with 0 sexual interest in kids, I find it a chore to read through.

Especially considering that most authors who write in these relationships don't restrict their characters to holding hands and sharing candy. At that point I just drop it.
