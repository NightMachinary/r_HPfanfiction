As far as number 10 goes, I remember having "boyfriends" when I was in the 11-12 year old range. They were the most adorably pitiful relationships ever, and all we ever did was share candy and maybe hold hands if we were feeling particularly bold, but there you have it. Obviously our love was deep and meaningful. I'm expecting a Hollywood movie adaption any time now.

A year or two later and you were starting to see some of the more traditionally "teenager" romances.

A movie that pretty accurately portrays "romance" at this age is My Girl. Just without ending in tragedy, I would hope. I'm sure there are others I could think of if I put my mind to it.
