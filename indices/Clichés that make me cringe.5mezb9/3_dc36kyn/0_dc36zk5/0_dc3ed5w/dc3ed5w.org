Of the two big/currently updating WBWL stories from last year, neither really has abusive parents. The first has time travel, but he's put with the Dursley's and his parents are told not to communicate with him because of MostlyGood!Manipulative!Dumbledore. In the second, there's a hidden reason that's revealed at the end of Book 1 explaining why it makes sense that he was put with the Dursleys, but Lily and Dumbledore are both actually good.

DP+SW is pretty dumb because of the whole harem thing, but at least it's readable because Harry actually faces roadblocks and the story is well-proofread. It gets confusing because of all the fanon politics, AU, and time travel. The end of Year 1 (Book 2) was solid, even if the path to it had pitfalls. Probably one of the better Manipulative!Dumbledore stories, since Dumbledore is a little OOC but not evil.

HP Prince of Slytherin has James being a dick, but he has a pretty well-painted motivation that Harry still isn't aware of, and Dumbledore isn't evil for once- it's long and is currently in the summer before 3rd year, and while it has some pitfalls due to the large cast of characters and slow start, I do think it has an interesting plot and good execution. Some AU elements obviously, but well done and made interesting- Year 2 was especially good, and the 1st chapter sets the scene by being a flashforward to the end of Goblet of Fire. It does suffer from the 11-year old problem, but I think I've gotten used to ignoring that, and it's addressed in-universe and handwaved. The end of year 2 revelations and some of the pre-year 3 summer stuff is really good.

I don't remember the title, but the first WBWL story that I read (4 years ago?) wasn't that bad, I think Harry went to Azkaban for a year but it still ended up being Harry/Ginny.
