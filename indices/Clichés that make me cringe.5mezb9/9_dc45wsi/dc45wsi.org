  Horridly abused Harry. Somehow, I feel like the one who was abused by reading it. Shame.
#+end_quote

Depends on what you define as horrid. There's plenty of over the top Dursley portrayals in Fanfiction, but I think people also got desensitized about the abuse Harry suffers at the Dursleys: It is pretty horrid and it's fair to expand on the glimpses we see in the Books.

  Custom ultra overclocked quad-core wand! Made with the rarest of wood and the most mythical of cores. Previous "legendary" status optional.

I blame Rowling and the stupid Elder Wand bullshit. I still can't fathom that this was her honest to god best idea to wrap up the final fight. I'm not surprised that fanfic authors pick up on that idea and try to resolve their conflict with +technobabble+ technicalities.

  Hey look! I drank a potion and am a falcon animagus! Scratch that, I'm actually a dragon animagus. Wait, no, a basilisk animagus is so much cooler!
#+end_quote

Totally annoying, especially because this happens in fics where Harry just "collects" these kinds of things and never uses them. You could probably get away with a Fic about a special magical Animagus form, but then you'd better make it the central point of your story.

  Evil Dumbledore. Somehow, in the stories where Dumbledore is supposed to be this evil mastermind, he is the dumbest (hah) person on the planet, with plans liable to be figured out by an 11-year old. "Harry, m'boy, it's just the cruciatus! Surely you can put this behind you?" Twinkle twinkle.
#+end_quote

Meh. IMHO Dumbledore is either evil or dumb.. I haven't yet heard a convincing argument why he didn't intervene at the Dursleys that didn't make him either an idiot or evil.

  Harry was framed and sent to Azkaban! Without a doubt the laziest plot line ever. All his friends now hate him, and Evil DumblydoreTM didn't help! Gasp! Befriending Bellatrix optional. Misunderstood Bellatrix optional.
#+end_quote

IMHO there's actually potential in the "Harry in Azkaban" idea, especially considering Fudge's and Umbridge's animosity. Most writers are just too lazy to do it with authenticity and just want a shortcut to their Dark!Harry who doesn't take no shit from no-one *swoon*.

  Romantic pairings early on.... Do people forget that these are 11 year-olds? The fuck? Again, I might be in the minority on this one, but i find it disgusting how so many fics want to shoehorn a romantic pairing in on these preteen Hogwarts kids. Not to mention the disturbing pairings like Snape/Harry. Some people have issues. Everyone has different tastes, but pedophilia is NOT okay.

Meh, there's a fine line here. Yeah, first year "true-love" romances are dumb, but Rowling's characters seem almost asexual until 5th year, which is equally as stupid. Most girls will certainly start puberty at age ~12-13 and be more interested in boys (which is second year at Hogwarts). Boys probably a good year later.
