Slavish canon rehash: I already had a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5kyfr0/did_you_change_your_preferences_or_pet_peeves/dbrqa2r/][rant]] about this a week ago, so I won't bore you with the same arguments again. Unfortunately, this cliche happens way too often.

--------------

My most hated cliche is however a Postwar Hermione submitting to a marriage law. Fortunately marriage law fics are becoming rarer these days.

It's the worst form of tyranny, something even Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and Maoist China didn't dare to implement. It's most likely something cooked up by immature teenagers who have no clue about what kind of human rights violation a marriage law is.

When it comes to fics dealing with it, I like the following 5 levels of responses:

1. The protagonists were too weak to fight, so they ran away as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/Escape][Escape]]

2. The protagonists organized a mass exodus, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6049450/1/Harry-Potter-s-Reaction-to-the-Marriage-Law][Harry Potter's Reaction to the Marriage Law]]

3. The protagonists asked a third party to eliminate certain individuals responsible for the marriage law, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2612901/1/There-s-Always-a-Way][There's Always a Way]]

4. The protagonists took out those responsible individuals by themselves, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4960536/1/The-Obligatory-Marriage-Law-Fic][The Obligatory Marriage Law Fic]]

5. The protagonists staged a revolution, took over the government, and executed anyone who supported the marriage law, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]]
