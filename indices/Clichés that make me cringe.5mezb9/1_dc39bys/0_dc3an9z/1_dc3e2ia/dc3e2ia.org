  Bringing up despotic regimes in relation to a fictional marraige law is not only irrelevant and unneeded, but it trivializes what those people had to go through.

No, it does not.

If the wizarding world resorted to tyrannical policies worse than that of Stalinist Russia, then it should be fought with utmost determinations.

  As for writing a fic featuring a marraige law, there's nothing wrong with that. It's fiction. You are willing to accept that the Harry Potter magical world is some 300 years behind technologically, yet you can't stand for it holding true societally as well? Come off it.

Even fictions have limits. I don't care how far back one society is, if it supports slavery or 'GOVERNMENT FORCED MARRIAGES', then that society should be overthrown.
