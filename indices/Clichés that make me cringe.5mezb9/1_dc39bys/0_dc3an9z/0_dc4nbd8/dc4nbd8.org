  You are willing to accept that the Harry Potter magical world is some 300 years behind technologically, yet you can't stand for it holding true societally as well? Come off it.

Is it really? The magical world have been (mostly) separated from the non-magical one for 300 years, that's a fact; but stating it is "300 years behind", on any level, is wrong in canon : the bets examples are brooms, we see them through a "technological" evolution in the books (Nimbus 2000 then 2001 then firebolt, in only 3 years).\\
Even if the Status of Secrecy was brutal (which is an assumption, and not a strong one at that: such decisions are frequently the end of a long process), the magical world have been diverging from the non-magical one for 3 centuries, it has not stopped brutally in 1692.\\
Now, regarding contracting in marriage : yes, it has been done historically; in the richest parts of society mainly. But, except for the highest nobility or the merchant class of the late middle ages, choice have frequently (and in a more or less visible way), been given. Choice between spouses deemed acceptable. This exists even today, in most if not all countries in the world, where a person (male or female) is expected to find a spouse in the contacts met in school or in social events, where everyone answer to a set of criterium that makes the persons met acceptable for the family.\\
In no society, by my knowledge, had it been acceptable for the state to choose a spouse for an individual; when forced, it has always been a choice of the familes involved. The last case I know of, when someone was married against his/her wishes, and those of his/her family, was Anne of Britanny (in the end of the 15th century), and said marriage was forced through a war, had deep political consequences, and a good image still had to be given (the bride went, free, and with her army, to her marriage).\\
Hogwarts, as the best school for magical, and further than that with the separation into houses through similarities, is probably already the best "meet your future spouse" that a society can accept.
