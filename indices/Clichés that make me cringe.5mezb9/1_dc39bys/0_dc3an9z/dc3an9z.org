While I agree that a hypothetical "marriage law" is a violation of personal liberty, comparing it to Communist China and Russia is ridiculous. Saying that "even Mao" didn't institute it is silly, because the situation in these two countries was infinitely worse. Marry someone who is not in the party? Your life is over. Marry someone your parents do not approve of? Your life is over... If you manage to actually do it. I have had family in communist Russia, and I have read several first person narratives of Mao's China. Bringing up despotic regimes in relation to a fictional marraige law is not only irrelevant and unneeded, but it trivializes what those people had to go through.

As for writing a fic featuring a marraige law, there's nothing wrong with that. It's fiction. You are willing to accept that the Harry Potter magical world is some 300 years behind technologically, yet you can't stand for it holding true societally as well? Come off it.
