I think it's reasonable to assume underfed, and underfed children don't grow that well. Dumbledore himself did say that he arrived 'not as well fed as I would have liked', which indicates he was probably vitamin deficient at least. And given the difference between Harry and Dudley, clearly they were fed different meals. However, I don't believe they went as far as never giving him a decent meal. It's more like Harry didn't get pudding, Dudley got constant junk as snacks, Dudley got second and third helpings, Harry got one, and his school lunches were undoubtedly stolen by bullies.
