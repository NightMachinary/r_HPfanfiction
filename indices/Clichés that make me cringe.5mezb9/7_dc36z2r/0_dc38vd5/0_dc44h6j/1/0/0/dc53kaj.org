I was raised by a mother who reminds me very strongly of the Dursleys (won't go into my sob story, but I'm one of the people who related to Harry because of this.) The thing is if it's the way you're raised and all that you know it /is/ normal. It wasn't until I was an adult and saw how other people interacted with their parents that I realized that something was wrong. So the stories where Harry goes off to angst and lists off all of his abuses seems off to me. Abused kids often don't realize they're abused, or if they do, they don't realize the full extent of how abused they are, because all of that is "normal" for them. And it pisses me off when fanfic authors get all melodramatic and say that Harry was treated like a house elf, because it is not a crime to give a kid some chores. It just makes you an asshole if you give one kid chores and not the other.

I agree with you that most of the abuse was mental. Harry knew pretty much from the start that he was unwanted, and you can't believe how much that can affect a kid. They were also so very wrong to encourage and overlook Dudley's bullying. As far as the old sock for the birthday, try no birthday presents at all. Or even recognition that it is your birthday in the first place. :P I was 23 when I got my first birthday cake after I told my boyfriend that I'd never had one before, so he went and bought me one. Years later, it's an iron-clad rule in the house that no matter what, /everyone/ gets cake for their birthday.

I've said before that Dursley abuse is a tender subject for me, and that's mostly because fanfic authors (and even JKR, to an extent) like to use them as a cheap source of angst and drama without actually putting thought into what it's actually like for kids raised by adults like that.

  It's due to magic neither of the boys they raised were completely ruined.

Think more positively than this. :) It gets better.
