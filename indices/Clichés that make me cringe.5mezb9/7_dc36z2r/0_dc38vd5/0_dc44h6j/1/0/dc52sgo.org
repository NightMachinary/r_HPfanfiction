Yeah, the school lunch thing was just me thinking about the only way he'd probably end up skipping two meals in a row - Vernon did make him skip meals as punishment for accidental magic, but I imagine that was a case of 'go-to-cupboard-without-dinner'.

I don't particularly care about technical abuse, I think the thing with the Dursleys was that it highlighted how abusive a parent can be without technically being abusive. I know a lot of people with Dursleys as parents really related to Harry a lot because of how he was raised. It verifies that no, parents like that aren't normal. Perhaps some people arent comfortable with monsters looking like normal parents, so they amp up the monsterness until they look like it.

I think if a social worker saw the cupboard, Harry wouldn't get taken off them, but only because heck, there aren't enough foster homes out there. I imagine they'd end up on a list, with them getting regular check ups, and Harry would get moved into a bedroom. But of course, with the second bedroom, they'd no doubt convince them that the cupboard was time out only, Harry had a perfectly good room upstairs filled with toys.

But the way they spoke to him, the way they treated him - that damages a child's psyche a lot. Who gives a child an old sock for their birthday? Harry was happy on Dudley's birthday, because he got to eat the unwanted dessert because it wasn't good enough. And a lemon pop because they didnt want to look bad in front of the vendor. As far as I'm concerned, the Dursleys were horrible monsters who should never have raised a child. It's due to magic neither of the boys they raised were completely ruined.
