  I don't particularly care about technical abuse, I think the thing with the Dursleys was that it highlighted how abusive a parent can be without technically being abusive.

Even then there are still small instances of physical stuff. The Dursleys never tell Dudley discourage Dudley from being physically aggressive towards Harry and in the mail instance Vernon encourages Dudley to at least poke Harry with Dudley's Smelting Stick.

There is also the time Petunia swiped a frying pan at Harry. A frying pan isn't exactly the first instrument you'd think to hit someone with, and it wasn't a light tap cause it was at hand. Chamber of Secrets specifically points out that it's a heavy blow aimed at his head. I think it would be safe to say there's probably mild physical stuff occurring "off-screen". Certainly no midnight beatings with a sock full of battery style stuff, but maybe a whack to the back of the head as Harry walks past for no reason other than amusement.
