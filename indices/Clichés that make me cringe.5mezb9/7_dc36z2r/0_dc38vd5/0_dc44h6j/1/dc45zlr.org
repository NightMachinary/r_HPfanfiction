I always assumed that it was more like "gets the smallest portion" type of underfed. Since child abuse is a pretty serious issue, that's one thing I really do prefer not be overdramatized. I can buy a Harry that's a bit skinny for his age at 11, but all the talk about how he's malnourished and half-starved are taking it a bit too far. The school lunch thing....eh, I guess that can just be considered personal interpretation since it wasn't even mentioned in the books?

I take it as the Dursleys being mean and spiteful, but in this one example not abusive. Dudley got to eat as much as he'd like, and Harry got /just/ enough. The only way that the Dursleys were truly, technically abusive is in the way that they spoke to Harry, at least by the standards of United State's CPS. I'm not sure if Britain's got different criteria.
