Because this is explicitly happening in the second book, but nowhere else. It might implied, and it might or might not be happening, but we only know it's happened that one time and people take it to automatically assume he's always only getting bread crumbs every three days. And considering a lot of their behaviour was because of their hatred of magic and at that time Harry just got back after his first year at a school of magic and they only did it because of Dobby's /magic/, it is not impossible for this one to simply be an outlier.

They might have starved him all the time, they might have not. But it's never actually addressed. This is why some people have difficulty believing that “no, it /had/ to have been the case”.
