  They might have starved him all the time, they might have not. But it's never actually addressed. This is why some people have difficulty believing that “no, it had to have been the case”.

You're right, we have no way to know for sure... but if I'd have to bet on it I'd put all my money on the bet that this wasn't the first occurrence. These are people who had a child living in a freaking cupboard for 10 years and the idea that they might not have been feeding him right is were some readers draw the line? Really? What kind of people put a child in a cupboard?! It's pretty sick.

If I see a parent strike a child I'm not going to think that I coincidentally witnessed the first and only exception of this ever happening. It's much more likely that there's a pattern.
