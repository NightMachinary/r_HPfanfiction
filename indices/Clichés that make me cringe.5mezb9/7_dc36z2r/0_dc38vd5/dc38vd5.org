And he is an excellent cook because he was forced to cook all the Dursley's meals, including fancy dinner party 5-course banquets. In reality I think Petunia once had him finish cooking some bacon that was on the stove in the first movie, and that's hardly an outrageous demand to make of an 11-year-old.

And even if he was starved at the Dursley's, from age 11 onward he only spent two months there out of the year, if that. That would have given him plenty of time and several growth spurts to catch up as he positively inhaled anything that wasn't nailed down at Hogwarts and the Weasley home.
