[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2855603/1/Here_I_Stand][Here I Stand]] is probably right up your alley. It's from the Marauder era. It follows Lily from her first year at Hogwarts to her last encounter with Voldemort. It's as close to cannon as you are going to get, with the caveat that the author had to add details and takes liberties with Lily's youth - to fill in what we don't know.

Even though it's pretty long, it's pretty fantastic.
