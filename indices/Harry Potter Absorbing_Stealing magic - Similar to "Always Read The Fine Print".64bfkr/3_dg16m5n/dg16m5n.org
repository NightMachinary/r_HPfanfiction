- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][/The Sacrifices Arc/]] --- Harry is an “absorbere”, which basically means he can make his magic eat someone\something else's. Warning: it eventually becomes a HP\DM slash.

  - Pros: 1. writing in general 2. characters 3. duels 4. lore
  - Cons: 1. Voldemort also has such a power and tries munchkinnig his way to victory, but the author artificially keeps him nerfed both in his actions and his abilities (AFAIK). 2. (ending spoiler) The story ends on a frustrating description of how Harry spills all the magic he had absorbed from VD into the oceans for some stupid reason or another. 3. Whenever an idiot-ball or a plot-ball requires handwaving, a prophecy kicks in and basically removes the free will of characters. 4. Manipulative --- but extremely stupid --- characters, including Dumbledore. The story often reads like an exploitation b-story for the emotions of rightful indignation, rage, fury, exasperation, etc. Seriously, no other story managed to piss me off so much as this one with some of its characters and the way they behaved, and I think that's precisely what the author's intention was (no idea what for, though).

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9443327/1/A-Third-Path-to-the-Future][/A Third Path to the Future/]] --- /HP/ × /[[http://x-menevolution.wikia.com/wiki/X-Men_Evolution_Wiki][X-Men: Evolution]]/ crossfic in which Harry is also a mutant whose power is to steal magic from magical creatures or artefacts.

  - Cons: 1. The story is somewhat similar to /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WithThisRing][With This Ring]]/ but is of a much lower quality in general (though later on there comes an Asgard-related plot arc which is at least a little more interesting \ better written). 2. Regarding the magic-stealing power itself: the author places limits on how much magic can Harry's mortal body hold; and the magical fights are often one-dimensional, with spells used like bullets and magic used as a muscle. 3. The story features a technically poly, but factually harem relationship. 4. The story has some cheesy \ badly written smut scenes.
