I really dont enjoy main character slash... especially DM/HP slash so likely would struggle to enjoy the Sacrifices Arc, although its premise does sound intriguing.

A Third Path also sounds mildly interesting but am not a fan of "superhero" crossovers whatsoever and if its also poorly written...

I may take a look at both if i run out of reading material or there are few other suggestions but neither strikes my fancy.

Thanks for the suggestions anyway.
