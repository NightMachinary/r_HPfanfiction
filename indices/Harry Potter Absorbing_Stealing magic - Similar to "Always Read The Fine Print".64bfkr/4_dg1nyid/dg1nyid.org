A really good fic that deals with this. Harry is essentially sent to a parallel universe where he discovered an ability he never knew he had in canon (due to his parents not surviving and him not being in contact with other magical people in his youth (when this ability typically revealed itself)). It does many things better than any other fanfiction imo.
