I was kinda bothered that gen z made fun of millennials for Harry Potter. I am gen z and Harry Potter is my life. I remember being a kid and watching the movies and then when I was old enough reading the books. Honestly fan fiction writers make the Hp fandom so much more creative. I'm in awe of my some my favorite stories that just bring more to the Harry Potter world.but yes I agree with you.
