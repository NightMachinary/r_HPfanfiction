Wow, this genuinely improved my mood today. I admit, I was one of those who wasn't all that into HP when it first came out (read the all 7 books during one spring break in college, 2 years after DH came out), but I also have read fanfics way more than I have canon, and I also will join you in saying thank you to the writers. Absolutely inspiring!

Thank you OP, for brightening my day (now that I've started my own fanfic) and for reminding me to be grateful for the incredible hard work of everyone here!
