There's your problem. Just stay away from twitter- it is one of the best decisions you can make. It's full of haters and toxic behaviour.

But yeah, I agree with you. I want to give a big "Thank you" to everyone who writes fanfiction. Lots of people on this sub seem to dislike fanfiction and canon for various reasons. So it's nice to see a bit more positivity around here.
