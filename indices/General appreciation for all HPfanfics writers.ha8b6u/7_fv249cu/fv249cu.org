I'm genX and my children are genZ and we all love HP. Speaking of Millennials, I started reading it in 1999 and have re-read the series countless times. Oh, and my millenial nephew also loves them. The only generation in our family who doesn't quite get the HP obsession are the boomers (my parents).
