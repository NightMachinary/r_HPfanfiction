I think I've missed the specific tweet, but have seen other memes like it. I just let them get on with it - I'm on the boundary between Millennial and Gen Z (depends on which boundaries are being used), but plenty of them are on TikTok or other online activities. I'm sure the generation after them will pull them up on it.

For what it's worth, my mum was in a role playing group for a fandom long before Harry Potter. This came as a huge shock to me as she showed zero geeky signs or interests.
