I have a deep, deep dark confession to make.

I started reading HP fanfiction before I ever saw a movie or read the book. It was after a year of reading that I finally picked up the first book and started reading the series and shortly after, watching the movies.

I love HP, truly, but my love for HP fanfiction is much, much greater. I like how cannon played out but man I love seeing what people do in fanfiction. There's so many more options for you to read. If you didn't like something you could change it.

I write sometimes and would love to get back into it. I have so many ideas (who doesn't though?)

Sure sometimes I get an item of my house. But now who isn't collecting something? I'm not ashamed of it. But I wouldn't say I'm clinging to it or something.

JK Rowling made some statements that I personally disagree with but I can totally understand how some people would feel some deep hurt from it too. I don't think it's necessary a bad thing to express that hurt.
