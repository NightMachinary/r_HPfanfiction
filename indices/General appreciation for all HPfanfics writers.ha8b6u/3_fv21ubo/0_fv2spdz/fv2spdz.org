I laughed at the opening of your comment and I'm totally agree with you on the love for the fanfic.

For me, Rowling's influence on my feeling for HP ends with the release of the last book, maybe the last movie if I'm feeling gracious. The tidbits she sprinkled after often make me feel frustrated instead of delighted and I don't even want to get into her general personal opinion because of how greatly it differs with mine. It's not a bad thing at all for people to express that hurt, especially them that benefited the most from having HP to get through life.
