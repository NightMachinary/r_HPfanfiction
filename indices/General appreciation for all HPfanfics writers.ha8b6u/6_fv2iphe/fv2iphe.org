45 year-old, here. I started reading Rowling's books just before Goblet of Fire was published, and HPFF in 2015. FanFics are a great way to continue the adventure, and I'm grateful to all the writers who have selflessly given of their time.

Every time I start a new fanfic, there's a little spark of excitement at what I'll "discover" in the story, and that spark never goes away.

Hi, OP, and welcome to the HPFF community. :)
