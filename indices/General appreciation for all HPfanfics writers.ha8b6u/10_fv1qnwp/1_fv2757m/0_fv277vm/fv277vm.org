It's nothing like the Cursed Child, I promise you. I take time travel seriously in this story.

There are no alternate universes or daughters of Voldemort or hopping back and forth through different time periods. The Time-Turners in this story are based off of the ones from PoA.

I think you'll like this story if you don't like the Cursed Child.

Awesome username, btw.
