I'm Gen Z(2004) too, but sadly, I cannot say the same. only one or two of my friends know anything about HP, and that is mainly restricted to the movies. The others mock HP and consider it 'cringey'. My sis who is an 9 year old Gen Alpha is showing some interest though, and has started to read the series after some encouragement.
