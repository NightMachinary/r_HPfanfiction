I am Gen-Z too(2001) and I read my first HP book when I was 11.

And I fell in love. My little 11 year old brain was blown away by the fact that such a world could exist. I became a voracious reader. Some of my best memories from my childhood came from HP. I have not yet found a better world or a better community.

After finishing all the books, I felt so sad. It was a bittersweet feeling, because the ending was so beautiful and I felt satisfied with it but I was sad, that I would never go back to this wonderful world that I found.

And then I found fanfiction. The rest as they say, is history. I still think that it simultaneously, it is one of the best and worst things to happen to me. I have a bit of an addiction, hehe.

Is HP perfect? Hell no. Just like anything that is created by a human, it has its flaws. There are plotholes, some characters aren't handled well, Dumbledore is a manipulative old geezer, Harry is a gullible child, etc, etc.

But despite it all, I have loved HP. And the fanfiction and the community that has sprung up. When I have kids someday, I am definitely gonna tell them all about this story that had enraptured me so much and entranced me so much. I just hope that they come to love it in the same way I did.
