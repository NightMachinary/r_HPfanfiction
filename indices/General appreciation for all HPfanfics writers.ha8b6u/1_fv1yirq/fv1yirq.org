That's really sad about Gen-Z (births 1997-2009), and I find that a bit weird, cause I'm Gen-Z (2001) and all my friends appreciate HP. I think the problem is more Gen Alpha (births 2010-2025), who were born after all the movies and books came out, so they never lived the HYPE that is HP.

HP books are the embers, imagination the spark, and fanfic the flames. The Harry Potter fandom is a bonfire that burns red, orange, green, purple.
