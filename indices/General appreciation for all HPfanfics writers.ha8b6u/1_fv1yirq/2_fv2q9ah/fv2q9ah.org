I'm Gen Z (2005), and I don't remember watching the movies or even knowing when they came out. But my mom introduced me to HP, and I read all the books at around 8/9 years old. The only reason I'm so into this fandom is probably because this is one of the few fandoms I'm in that has good fanfiction.

Httyd? No good fanfics. Narnia? Mostly the same few storyline, only a few epic ones. All the classics? No good fanfiction either.

I don't know why HP has such a large fandom and large quantity of fanfics, but it's awesome. There are so many different AUs to read, and even sticking to canon there's still so much good stuff.
