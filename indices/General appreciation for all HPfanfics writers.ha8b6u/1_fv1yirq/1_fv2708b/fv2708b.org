I agree the problem is more Gen Alpha, but no-one really gets the boundaries so it all gets confused. For example, I'm sometimes put as millennial as I was born in the mid 90s. My suspicion is that it is the later part of Gen-Z and some of the older Gen Alpha's who are behind those memes.

I think where they missed the hype, they also missed the peak of the community and so to them it's 'just' books (and some fantastic ones have come out since). Back when you could find a booming group, landcomms to match any ships or interest. There were adulty adults writing fantastic books, young teens getting into disputes with each other about how they were better than other's their age. Dozens of active fanfic sites, plus some snailmail fic posting still going. I remember doing a sweet exchange with people form all over the world - I swapped with someone in the US.
