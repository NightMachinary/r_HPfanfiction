Yeah, same here. I've recently left education and had needed to educate myself on some of the current fads like LOL Toys, Roblox, the latest programmes and the like in order to have any hope of keeping up.

Yup, I managed to get some highly coverted sweets I'd had in Canada plus some extra (red vines are way over hyped). My partner was in the USA and I accidentally spent way too much on pic'n'mix - so much the cashier kindly asked if I wanted to put the bag down and get less - and posted it off. It cost me an absolute fortune - pretty much everyone went over, except the one person who gushed over the box they received but never sent one out.
