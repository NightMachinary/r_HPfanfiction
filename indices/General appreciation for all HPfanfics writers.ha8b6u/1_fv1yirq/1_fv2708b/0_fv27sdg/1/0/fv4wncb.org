They have seen Disney, but all when they were younger. Avengers, Sonic, Pikatchu, Ready Player 1 (the 10 yos). A few have seen The Lion King, HTTYD, Frozen 2, but they all prefer the new versions instead if the old. They read new French books, like Les Filles Modeles and Lea Olivier (Quebec). So they have seen Disney, but it's not their favourite.
