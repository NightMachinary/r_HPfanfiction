“HP books are the embers, imagination the spark, and fanfic the flames”

I love this! The original Harry Potter books are great because they create a fantastic world and tell a good story, but there's so much room to expand upon that world and I think that's what caught people's imaginations and led to such a thriving fanfic community. Especially since Harry is an unreliable narrator so there aren't many canon limits to what's possible with magic.

Even with the mess she's making at the moment (both with Harry Potter stuff like CC and with non-hp stuff) I will always be grateful to JKR for giving us that world.
