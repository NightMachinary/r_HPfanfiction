(My first books were W.I.T.C.H.) I came to the HP fandom late (read the books in 2016) but I grew up with the movies, I watched the first three when I was 4, went to the cinema for part 1 and 2 of Deathly Hallows, I remember the posters that didn't even need the name of the series for everyone to know what is was... good times :')
