HP is what first got me into fanfiction, which then got me into writing. I've read countless fics that are better than some books I've read and writing is a huge creative outlet for me now. The community and fandom verse are a huge part of my life and honestly I kinda prefer the wizarding world that us fans have created to the actual books. I agree with someone above that purely from a reading standpoint the HP books don't rank that highly for me. But despite how much my fanfic reading has expanded over the years, I always fall back to HP from time to time.

As a writer and reader that's to all the other writers that work tirelessly and thanks to all the readers who keep us going!
