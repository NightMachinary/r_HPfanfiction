  Lately, I'm very into the trio dynamic as I'm missing all my friends and more interested to read about their friendship than romance but it's not mutually exclusive.

Does a slightly expanded group count? Ginny is included from the start in the linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) series, and there are actually good in-story reasons for Draco to be around, too. He's still snarky and cutting, but since he has an older brother, his father deliberately conditioned him to become a Gryffindor, in order to have a bet each way. And he didn't tell Draco that he was doing it, but it worked in a twisted kind of way. Draco is quiet, and torn between his feelings and his family, but to Gryffindor he goes, and finds a measure of happiness in warmer and louder company, and he would no longer fit in Slytherin.

Note that not much of that happens in the first book, which is pre-Hogwarts (but it's an excellent read in its own right).
