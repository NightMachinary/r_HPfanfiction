Im reading linkffn(The Augurey by La-Matrona) right now, its pretty good so far. I also really enjoyed linkffn(What We Lost by JacobApples) but that has a odd pairing with Harry/Andromeda so you may not like that. It has a currently updating sequel/spinoff. If you want a shorter, wholesome and cute H/Hr fic during school years check out linkffn(Favorite Things by Stanrick). linkffn(Vitam Paramus by TheEndless7) is good too, has a hurt/comfort spin to it though, so its a little heavy for the first half. I could prolly think of more but i gotta go play civ 6 now.
