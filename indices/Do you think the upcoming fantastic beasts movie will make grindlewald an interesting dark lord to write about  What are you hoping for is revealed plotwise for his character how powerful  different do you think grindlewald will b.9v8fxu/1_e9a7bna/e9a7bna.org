I'm actually kind of sad it's coming out and a canon is being developed for him. Though some people don't like it, I love reading interpretations of the blank page characters. When done well, they allow for some extremely creative writing both character wise and plot wise. Once the canon is developed, I've noticed people tend to write towards that rather than just using it as a base and it can make it harder to find unique stories. Maybe that's just me though.
