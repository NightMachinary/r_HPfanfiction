My headcanon for Grindelwald is that he had some ties to the Baltic Nobility and tried to use the power vacuum created by Brest Litowsk to claim his "Birthright" and was denied when Versailles revoked that Treaty. Resentful of Britain and France, he made common cause with the Nazis. He supplied them with stuff like Veritasserum in exchange for things like V1/2, which he modified to home in on magic (some of the "misses" actually hit hidden magical houses). At the same time he used the Eastern Front to rid "his lands" of the Soviets.

Throw in some love triangle where Dumbledore wanted Grindelwald, who merely toyed with his feelings while having a secret relationship with Arianna. Dumbledore finds out, is hurt and confronts Grindelwald and the rest is history.

In my opinion, a noble with some legitimacy and huge territorial/power ambitions who has no qualms about pacts with the devil and grudges for days makes a better story than Evil McEvil and his evil followers.
