I'm trying to think up a situation that counts as a clusterfuck and I think I've got one. Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel.

The Philosopher's Stone is based on phoenix rebirth. Brewing a specific pair of potions with the Elixir of Life causes one person to disappear and the other person to become pregnant with the person who disappeared. Combined with a gender altering potion Nicolas and Perenelle have kept themselves alive for several hundred years while also keeping the specifics of how the Elixir actually works a closely guarded secret. They're each technically the others kid. Also explains their frequent multi-year absences from public life.
