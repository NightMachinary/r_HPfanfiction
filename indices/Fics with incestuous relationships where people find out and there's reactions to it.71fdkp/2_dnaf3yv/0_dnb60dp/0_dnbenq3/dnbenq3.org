Just because something's legal doesn't mean it doesn't squick people out. Or that they'd approve if their children decided to get it on. In America, it's perfectly legal to take upskirt photos in a lot of places, but that doesn't mean people are okay with it. In fact, most are very much not okay with this and are trying to change laws in those states so that it is illegal.
