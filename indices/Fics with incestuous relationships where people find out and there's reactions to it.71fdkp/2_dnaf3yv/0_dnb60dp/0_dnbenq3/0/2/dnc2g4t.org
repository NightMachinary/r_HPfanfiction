Neither Harry or Hermione were raised in the magical world, though. They were raised in the Muggle world where the whole cousin thing is a lot less common and much less accepted in this day and age. Harry especially may have issues given his upbringing where "strangeness" was looked down upon greatly. I have a feeling there's some stuff from that kind of upbringing he couldn't shake even after years and years away from the Dursleys it'd be so deeply ingrained into his psyche.

Also, the whole Purebloods doing it thing may actually cause a /greater/ aversion to cousincest in their families as they /fought/ against all of that. They may view it as their children taking a step back and be unsupportive as they view it as them disrespecting what they fought for.

I'm not even suggesting it should be outlawed. People should be allowed to love and do who they want (as long as everything is consensual), but that still doesn't change that there are many out there who wouldn't be okay with it. For medical reasons, familial reason, moral reason, ect.
