In case James and Rose, their parents wouldn't be happy, but if they insisted on their relationship, their parents should give in eventually.

Since the Magical World was so small, many Purebloods most likely married their first cousins anyway. I suspect their tolerance for first cousin marriages was a lot higher than in Muggle World.

[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage][First cousin marriage]] does increase the risk of birth defects, but it only entails a similar increased risk of birth defects and mortality as a woman faces when she gives birth at age 41 rather than at 30. If you want to ban first cousin marriages based on increased birth defects risk, you might as well ban older women from giving birth.
