  After killing Voldemort immediately following his ressurection at the end of their sixth year, Harry and his twin sister Danielle decide that, as the law of the land refuses to penalize the Death Eaters, they'll do it themselves. And so, they decide to rob them all blind. Warning: twincest. Lots. Of. Twincest.
