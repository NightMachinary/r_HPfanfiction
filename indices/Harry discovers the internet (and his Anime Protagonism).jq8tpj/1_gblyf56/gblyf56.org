In book canon, movie canon or modern-day AU? IDK if it was just me or not but I couldn't watch anything longer than the average music video (3-5 minutes long) w/o constant buffering until ~2012. No way is Harry watching anime on dial-up in England in 1994.

Also, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy_Europe][Best Buy didn't come to Europe until 2010,]] and Google Chrome was released in 2008.
