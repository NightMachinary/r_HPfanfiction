Just about anything on ffn is gold, its a hand selected group of authors. My favorites are Kinsfire and Jaconais.

It really depends on what genre you are looking for as well. Are you looking for post-hogwarts epilogue compatible stuff? Canon Pairings? Year number? Harry/Hermione, Harry/Luna, Harry/Cho, Harry/Many?

If you do not know what you are looking for, and want exposure to a list of ideas I found lirasnape (lists of lists) very helpful when I was first started.

Unfortunately...I only have a few gems that stick in my head (though author names are more readily available), I've read...probably MOST of the het or non-pairing /good/ stuff on the net, so its hard for me to narrow down specifics without more info. I'd be happy to try and help, but I didn't keep a spreadsheet or anything (unfortunately).

*edit: so I've been told I should self plug, as many consider at least one of my stories a classic. But I don't like doing it. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Eginnymylove][http://www.fanfiction.net/~ginnymylove]]*
