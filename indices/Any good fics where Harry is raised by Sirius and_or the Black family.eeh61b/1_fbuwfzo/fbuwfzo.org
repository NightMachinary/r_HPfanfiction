[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7736764][The Black Resurgence]] has Sirius raising Harry with a lot of pureblood politics/culture, but it's abandoned. I don't know anything about the other fic that continues it.

Not Harry though he's in this iirc, but a fic where Hermione is raised by the Black family that's got pureblood culture is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6237706][The Brightest Black]].
