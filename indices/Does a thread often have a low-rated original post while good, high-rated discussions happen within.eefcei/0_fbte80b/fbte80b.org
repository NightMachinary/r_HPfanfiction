Not really that I have seen, really it is the topic of this one that is so decisive.

Not really going to get into my views on this. Had a huge thing typed up, realized I don't care to share that much, so instead you get this.

Lots of people hated the base topic, many people are tired of being told they're not inclusive enough of different things. They hate being told what they are doing wrong by some other group spouting the newest failure.

This is a place to escape that stuff, it's fanfiction for a young adult fantasy boy series. They don't want serious here, they want to discuss how many metrics tons of tnt explosive is an Erumpent Horn equivalent to. Absolutely useless but fun and interesting things.

There are likely dozens of subreddits about feminism, actionable females, or some other cause or injustice. This isn't the place for that.

So let's keep this place fun, not a political social hellscape of stuff that has nothing to do with the maturation cycles of Mandrakes around the world, shipping difficulties and costs of them as compared to letting a few muggleborn miss over half a school year.
