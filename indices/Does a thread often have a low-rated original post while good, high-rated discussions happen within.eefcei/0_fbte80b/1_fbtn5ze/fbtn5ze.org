Then I am more than happy that you haven't posted in that thread. I am not big cultural crusader myself, I posted it truly mostly as “a fun fact”, but I have been pleasantly surprised how actually civilised discussion we got there.

And no, I don't care at all how many points I've got, I am still not sure I know what it means, or where to find my total score. If I post here, it is only because I want to participate.
