They don't really mean anything except I guess some inferences can be made. 0-100 people are either new/unactive or bots or trolls. 1000-5000 are the mostly normal people going about normal reddit lives. Extremely high point people are the ones that just kinda make generic clickbait posts on popular (and braindead) subreddits.
