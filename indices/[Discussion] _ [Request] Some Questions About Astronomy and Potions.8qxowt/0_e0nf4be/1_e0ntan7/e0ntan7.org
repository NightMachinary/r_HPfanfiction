Ok, but if the magic emited by stars billions of miles away has /any/ measurable effect on magic performed on Earth, no matter how miniscule, they have to be pumping out truly astonishing quantities of it.

After all, the visible - and otherwise - quantities of the EM spectrum from other stars which actually reaches Earth and can be measured is in the fractions of a percent of what they actually produce. Hence; the Sun being a reasonable source of magic for Earth.

The only mention of Mars having any kind of effect on life on Earth is from the centaurs, who say during PoA that Mars is bright tonight, which I think is really more to do with the coming events - the rise of Voldemort and the second civil war. Which - to me - implies that the planets have more influence over the more ephemeral magics govorning us, like fate.
