Not dark or angsty but it is a good bit of fun, basically Hermione falls asleep in the common room and rather than wake her Fred just takes her back up to bed sleeping but gets caught by her roommates. Chaos ensues when roomies assume they're having a secret relationship and being Fred he goes along with it. Like I say, it's fun, a bit fluffy but I like it lol
