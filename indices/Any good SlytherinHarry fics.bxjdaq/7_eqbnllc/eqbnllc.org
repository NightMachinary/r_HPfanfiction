Irish216's Linkffn(Thanks to a Snake)

Do FemHarry Fic's count? If so Nemesis13's Linkffn(The Lady of Slytherin-Dark Beginnings) is a good fic, though a bit dark, especially in the beginning. I also recommend his other fics he has some great renditions of Bellatrix and the Black family as well a Lily as FemRevan.
