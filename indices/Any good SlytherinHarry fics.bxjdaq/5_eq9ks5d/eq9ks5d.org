I will never not recommend Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux). Despite a generic-sounding premise, it does a lot of very interesting stuff with it that I don't want to spoil here, so all I'll say is that the characters are kept in character. No one gets Leather Pants-ed or Death Eater-ed, and Voldemort's crimes are nether whitewashed nor glossed over. This is the man who murdered Harry's parents and would do it again if he thought it would benefit him, and they both know it.

(Also, Dumbledore is genuinely competent. This is admittedly a personal preference that you may or may not share, but I can't /stand/ when people write Dumbledore as being completely inept.)
