Linkffn(Fantastic elves and where to find them) if you want something funny. No pairings since it ends after Harry dealt with You-Know-Who in third year. Crazy Harry.

Linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter) danger is everywhere, children of death eaters in hogwarts try to kill him, but he's got a respawn ability. Harry/Hermione, powerful Harry.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) has lots of Harry/Tom interaction and friendship, but no romance since Tom doesn't feel love but values Harry as his dark apprentice. Unfortunately it's incomplete and updates have slowed down a bit.

Linkffn(Reunion by Rorschach's Blot) powerful Harry, Hermione, Luna and Susan in Slytherin after some time travel madness. Pretty cracky.
