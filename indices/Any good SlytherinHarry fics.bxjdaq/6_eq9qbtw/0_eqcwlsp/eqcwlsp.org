Thanks for your recs!

Here are some of my favs, all AO3: (don't know how to do the bot so bear with)

the Sarcasm and Slytherin group (Possible WBWL, Harry's got a twin, James is still alive- a bit bashy, but it's my fav so far)

Paradoxical Parallels (Sorta dark!harry, basically like young voldy)

The Amalgamation series (HP, Percy Jackson cross. It's actually a really good read, even tho i don't read PJ)
