Could you recommend some you enjoyed on ao3 (or ffnet)?

Some fics I thought of:

Welcome to Hogwarts 1949 is one of my favorites: linkffn(2550563)

Salvation in Shadow... give it more than one chapter to judge... (not that the first one is horrible, just very clich√©d) linkffn(9735652)

Just Another Orphan, Harry is not the BWL, linkffn(10511318)

With Strength of Steel Wings is super long, and has some more and some less interesting parts from what I remember. linkffn(9036071)

The Other Side of the Coin, it's been a while since I read it, but I remember it's very different from other fics. linkffn(5843349)
