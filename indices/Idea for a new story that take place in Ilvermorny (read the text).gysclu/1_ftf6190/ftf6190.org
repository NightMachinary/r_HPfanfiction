The plot and main ideas sound very interesting - love diverse setting - if a bit too similar to original (mainly villain - sociopath, dark magic obsession, horkrux) or Mary sue (what Salazar tree in Illvermory)

What would make or break it is your personal writing style, pacing of the story, Mysteries and reveals in good places, good grammar etc.
