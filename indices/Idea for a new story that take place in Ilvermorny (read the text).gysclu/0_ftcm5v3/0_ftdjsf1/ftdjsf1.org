Very good points. But the reason i want to make the villab the heir to Salazar is because Tom wasnt his last decendent. There is a line of Salazar's decendents still living in America and i wanted to do a think like the skywalker saga where the main villan of the saga is always palpatine. So i thought. What if the main villan of the wizarding world is Salazar and his decendents
