Every idea can be good depending on how good the writing is. There are a lot of pieces of fiction that I would judge negatively reading a summary that I actually do enjoy.

Having said that; I don't think it's a good idea to make your villain related to Voldemort or Salazar Slytherin. It could work written well enough, but some ideas are so hard to pull of that they're better left alone.

And you would have to really think out why it's an young Ilvermorny student that has to stop your villain. What's sets him apart that he can actively combat a villain that seemingly has already toppled multiple governments? Especially when Hermione is right there and smart enough to notice an billionaire being in control of 99% of all magical communities. I'd keep it localised so that you don't run into the problem of readers asking why Hermione and Harry are doing nothing.

The steampunk setting sounds cool, BI POC main charachter sounds cool also. Have fun and good luck!
