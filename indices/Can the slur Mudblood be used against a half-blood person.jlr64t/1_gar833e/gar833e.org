You can use whatever slur you want against whoever you want, if you're trying to insult someone. If its remotely close to on-target, its a more powerful insult.

Calling a half-blood a mudblood is a very accurate insult- they've got half-blood and half mud, so they're a mudblood.

Plus, you've got to take into account the person who would be saying something like that. Would they really be concerned with how correct their words are, or would they just be spewing vitriol and hate?
