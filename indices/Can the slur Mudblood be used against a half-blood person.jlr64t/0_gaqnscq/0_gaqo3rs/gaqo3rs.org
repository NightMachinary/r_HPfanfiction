That's why I was wondering about it. I don't remember it being used that way, but hypothetically, it could work? Since it's about having "dirty Muggle blood"... I also think "blood traitors" should work, I guess? Do you think using it in a fanfiction would be correct? I'm a bit hesitant about it being wrong... Would it bother you if you read someone calling a half-blood Mudblood?
