Thank you for your opinion. I agree with you, it might sound like a mistake ... hard to find some adequate insults. I went to look at the discussion you mentioned, and it was really helpful! Yeah, I'm not much into "mongrels" too, but I quite like "mutt", as I feel it's more agressive while still fitting well to the idea. Will definitely sound harsh in a fight. Thank you very much!
