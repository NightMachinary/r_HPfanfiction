Well, it wouldn't bother me, per se, but it's commonly assumed that the word only refers to Muggleborns; using it for a Half-blood might suggest poor knowledge of canon (unless, of course, there is some sort of explanation in the text as to why the character chose to use this particular word).

There has actually been a discussion here a couple days ago about what insults might be used against Purebloods and Half-bloods. I remember "mongrels" being suggested for the latter; personally, it reminds me of Gilgamesh a little too much, but I suppose it's an option.
