It is a rather strange concept and I'm not surprised it could put some people off.

The zones aren't the focal point of the story though, and only a fragment of the timeline will take place in them.

They provide a balance: they serve as a stark contrast to the very magical chapters up ahead, and they are the price to pay for the feasts of magic that are in play in this AU world (e.i. the Curtain).

I like to put our beloved characters in challenging situations. A place where they can't use their wands is one of them.

But ultimately, to each their own ;)
