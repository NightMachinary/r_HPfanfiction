Speaking as someone who is meh on both characters, this type of post by a Ron or Hermione fan is always funny because for a grievance against one there's typically a matching action by the other.

Ron called her a nightmare to Harry. Hermione just overheard it. She also happened to /be/ a nightmare, which is why she isn't well liked in universe.

She started just as many fights with Ron and I'm pretty sure Harry noticed them, too. He also noticed her jealous behavior in HBP. Hermione had no excuse for disliking Fleur. She did it because Ron found her attractive.

  made sure to publicly snog and more or less grope her in front of Hermione and Ginny

Teenagers and I suppose we should also dislike Harry, too? Ginny for standing in the middle of a corridor? All the *teenagers* in Madam Puddifoot's? This also strips Lavender of whatever agency she had.

  Hermione finally snapped after being abused by Ron for a couple of weeks and sicced canaries on him

"Hermione responded to verbal abuse by being physically abusive"

Also she sicced canaries on him because she was jealous. She also attacked him after he returned in DH.
