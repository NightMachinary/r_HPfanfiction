Well given that superhero names are often reflective of identity, philosophy or power (besides being stupid sounding most of the time):

-Disarming Deer - Harry (because stag don't alliterate)

-Colourful - Dumbledore

-Mirror - the twins, add cracked/stained/whatever to get the Patil

-The Greatest Crimson Student - Seamus (because an Irish student who likes explosions would like Megumin)

-Library Girl - Hermione

-Magizoophile - Hagrid (he don't understand the sad implications of the name)

-Tartan Cat - McGonagall

-Inconsistency - Rowling
