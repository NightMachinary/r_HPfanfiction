My headcanon is that Charlus and Dorea, in an act of self-preservation, decided to flee Britain during the Grindelwald Years and move to America, where their branch of the Potters stayed, which is why we don't know anything about them.

(I subscribe to the theory that Charlus and Fleamont are brothers)
