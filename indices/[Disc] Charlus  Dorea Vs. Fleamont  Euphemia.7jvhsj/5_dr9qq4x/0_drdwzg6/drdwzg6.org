Imagine of Beethoven finished one of his symphonies, and then 5 years later decides to add another section to it that isn't nearly as good, has been written in part by other people, and hasn't been crafted with nearly the same level of care and attention that the first part was.

People would cut it out of performances and stoically ignore it as anything other than questionable indulgence on Beethogven's part.

I'm sure you see the analogy.
