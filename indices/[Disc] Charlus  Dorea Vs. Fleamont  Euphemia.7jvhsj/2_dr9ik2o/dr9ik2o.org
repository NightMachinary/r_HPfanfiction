I prefer Charlus and Dorea. Not only do the names not sound utterly ridiculous, but they already existed in canon prior to pottermore. It just seems silly to me to pass up an already existing pair of characters with an interesting connection to the Blacks that can be built on in favor of two new random characters that only exist on pottermore and aren't even any good. Essentially for me it's a matter of book canon trumping pottermore canon for the most part. Even though Charlus and Dorea's place on the Potter family tree was never confirmed in-book, I think the fact that the book even mentioned them ought to give them prominence over any pottermore additions. On the other hand, I wouldn't mind the Fleamont and Euphemia characters being used as great-grandparents or placed elsewhere on the family tree so long as Charlus and Dorea have the grandparent slot. Then there's the fact that I've read so many fics that use Charlus & Dorea prior to F & E being made up that they've already solidly filled that niche in my mind and there's no replacing them. EDIT: On closer review, Charlus and Dorea's names didn't come up directly in the book, but my arguments that they existed as characters long before pottermore still stands.
