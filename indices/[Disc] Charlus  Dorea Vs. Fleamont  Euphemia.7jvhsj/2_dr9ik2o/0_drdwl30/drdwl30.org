Charlus and Dorea being canon would have also directly implied "Manipulative Dumbledore" being canon. Because if they /were/ canon, then Harry would have close family in the blacks, close family that was firmly in line with the light, and close family that was perfectly suitable to take him in. Namely Andromeda Tonks.

I think that might have been a reason for her to shy away from it.
