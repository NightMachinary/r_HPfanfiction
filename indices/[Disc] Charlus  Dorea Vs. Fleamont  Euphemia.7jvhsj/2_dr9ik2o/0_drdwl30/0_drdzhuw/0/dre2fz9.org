  I wouldn't necessarily consider the Tonks family to be close relatives. They're related yes, but there are quite a few degrees of separation involved. They'd be about as closely related as the Weasleys.

Actually, yeah, you're right. If Dorea is his grandmother, Arthur Weasley would be his second cousin once removed, and Andromeda would be his second cousin.

That would still make a "He had no other family to take him in" pretty much completely not true though.

The blood protection is a valid argument if someone of Lily's blood was needed, if it was only /family/ that was needed it isn't. I don't know if that was specified in the books myself.

I think Dumbledore specifically said that the Dursleys were Harry's last living family a few times. If Dorea were his grandmother he'd have to know he was lying, hence the manipulative part. But, like I said, I don't think J.K. ever intended for that to be the case, which is why she might have invented an unrelated set of grandparents with an unknown relation to the blacks for Harry.
