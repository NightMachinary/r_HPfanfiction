I wouldn't necessarily consider the Tonks family to be close relatives. They're related yes, but there are quite a few degrees of separation involved. They'd be about as closely related as the Weasleys.

That doesn't even take into consideration sacrificial protection connected to Lily's blood, the obscurity security provided by hiding him in the muggle world, and the fact that the Dursleys are much closer relatives.

Dumbledore doesn't necessarily need to be 'manipulative' to place Harry with the Dursleys when there are plenty of legitimate reasons for it. The only things we can really fault him for is not investigating the Dursley's suitability more thoroughly, not checking up on him, and leaving him literally on the doorstep.
