  Essentially for me it's a matter of book canon trumping pottermore canon for the most part. Even though Charlus and Dorea's place on the Potter family tree was never confirmed in-book, I think the fact that the book even mentioned them ought to give them prominence over any pottermore additions.

Books never mention them.

Also Euohemia is much more normal name than Dorea.
