Rowling clearly never intended Charlus and Dorea to be James' parents.

  James's parents were elderly, were getting on a little when he was born, which explains the only child, very pampered, had-him-late-in-life-so-he's-an-extra-treasure, as often happens, I think. They were old in wizarding terms, and they died.

In 2006 Rowlings Charlus and Dorea appeared for the first time - on a drawing of Black Family Tree which also showed Dorea to be 57 at the time of her dead. That's definitely not "old in wizarding terms".

  It wasn't until recently that JKR came out with Euphemia and Fleamont, and there were many people that, using the facts that had been given previously, came to the conclusion that Dorea and Charlus were James' parents.

Some people are just bad at research and reaching right conclusions - the scale of not knowing misinterpretation of canon in fanfics shows that very well.

  Your dad's place,' said Sirius. â€˜Your grandparents were really good about it; they sort of adopted me as a second son. Yeah, I camped out at your dad's in the school holidays, and when I was seventeen I got a place of my own. My Uncle Alphard had left me a decent bit of gold -- he's been wiped off here, too, that's probably why -- anyway, after that I looked after myself. I was always welcome at Mr and Mrs Potter's for Sunday lunch, though

He mentions his relation to Alphard and his being blasted out from the tree but wouldn't mention that people still on it are aforementioned Harry's grandparents? Really? And Alphard got blasted out for leaving him gold while Dorea remained despite giving him home for the time outside of Hogwarts? I think not.

Note that there is no need to include any information later than reveal of Charlus and Dorea existence to show that theory to be false.
