If I make James Potter's parents Charlus and Dorea, probably everyone who knows about Fleamont and Euphemia also knows about the previous fanon. It won't confuse them.

If I make them Fleamont and Euphemia, I'll confuse people who aren't up to date on the latest from Pottermore.

I'm more concerned about whether I confuse readers than whether I stick with canon.

There's very little difference to explore. It's pretty much just a couple names.
