Not biologically, but I grew up with a whole slew of 4th cousins and I could never imagine any sort of romantic relationship with any of them (and trying to is gross) and I ended up in high school with a couple of distant cousins by marriage and I can't imagine thinking of any of them as anything other than family. Because I was raised in a society that frowned upon cousin marriages, as I would suspect Harry's upbringing (in the wider muggle world) would as well. (Especially because he doesn't have any family. He finds out the Weasleys are cousins, in any form, he is probably not jumping to marry any of them.) Perhaps it is common in Wizarding Britain, but I suspect those raised outside of the Wizarding World aren't jumping on the bandwagon.
