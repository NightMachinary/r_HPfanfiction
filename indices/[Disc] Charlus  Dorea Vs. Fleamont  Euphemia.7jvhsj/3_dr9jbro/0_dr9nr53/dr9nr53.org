I also think multiple branches make the family more interesting. I also don't think (book) canon supports C&D in the slightest. And Dorea being Harry's grandmother makes him, like, third cousins with the Weasleys which makes me feel uncomfortable, and I suspect a muggleborn(raised) would feel the same. (Are the any stories where Harry is Dorea's grandson and realizes how related he is to the Weasley's?)

I also just like the Fleamont and Euphemia back story. And I'm honestly surprised that all the writers who have tired of the "same old tropes" haven't embraced a new alternative. There's ALOT of story to be told with F&E that hasn't been told yet.
