I prefer Fleamont and Euphemia because Charlus and Dorea never made sense as James' parents. Due to that I don't really consider there to have been any kind of "replacement" having happened.

JKR always said that James' parents were already very old even by wizarding standards when he was born. That just doesn't fit with Charlus and Dorea so the only way you could ever have believed them to be James' parents would be if you were not aware of the full Potter backstory.

And in any case, having multiple branches of the Potter family is more interesting.
