I don't think "Canon" makes a lick of sense honestly. Mostly because it doesn't add up with Grindelwald's war. Apparently there was a Potter in the wizengamote who advocated for wizarding aid to WWI, yet when there was a war that already involved wizards, where were the Potters?

I really love fanfictions where Harry's grandparents have a role in that conflict, because to me it just makes absolute perfect sense. James was part of the war, Harry was part of the war, Apparently Rowling decided that even "Henry Potter", Harry's great-grandfather, was at least involved with a war. What about the generation that was alive during what was probably on of the most significant conflicts in recent history? That whole generation should have been knee-deep in it yet there's no indication this even occurred to Rowling.

I'm either not aware of Rowlings views on this, or she simply didn't have them. If the latter is the case, then I feel justified in saying that her views are irrelevant. If she can't take the time to make her later additions about Harry's family history consistent with the story she's already written, then I don't see how it's anything but badly thought out fanfiction. Kind of like that other book...
