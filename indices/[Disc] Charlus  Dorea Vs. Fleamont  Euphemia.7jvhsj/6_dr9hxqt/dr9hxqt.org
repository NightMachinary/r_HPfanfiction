I've never seen anything really interesting done with Charlus and Dorea as characters that couldn't have been done with Fleamont and Euphemia --- they are mostly plot devices, as far as I can tell, and not the right kind --- and they mess up the canon plotline because they mean Harry /did/ have some surviving wizard relatives (namely Andromeda and her husband). Using Charlus and Dorea is mostly just a cheap ploy to make Harry "Lord Black". Canonically they are the blankest of slates.

On the other hand, Fleamont and Euphemia have at least /some/ canon characterization to them, an established, kinda charming backstory, etc. They're nothing /special/, but I like them. The Potters as Diagon Alley types as opposed to pompous aristocrats is much more to my taste, thank you very much.

On the whole, with a couple of exceptions, there's little reason why who Harry's paternal grandparents were should be at all /relevant/ to the story. Name-dropping Charlus and Dorea in this day and age when it's entirely besides the point of the stor just comes across as pointless, petty raspberry-blowing at Pottermore writings in general.

(The exceptions are, again, if for some reason you /want/ to push for a Harry/Black family connection, though I don't think it's a good idea; or if you started a story or AU using Charlus and Dorea back in the day when people didn't know better, and want to stay consistent.)
