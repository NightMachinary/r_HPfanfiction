Good points, but I do have one I would like to refute.

Charlus and Dorea existing in canon doesn't throw off the plot line of the Dursleys being Harry's only living relatives.

If you go back through both bloodlines (James and Lily's) eventually you'll find a living relative no matter what their names are or whether they're mentioned in the books.

The point of putting Harry with the Dursleys is that it was the same blood flowing through Harry as it was in Lily and therefore Petunia and Dudley because it was a direct blood relative and that's why the blood wards worked according to dumbledore. (even though I think the whole explanation of how Harry first survived the killing curse is terrible and I would have preferred it remain a complete unknown to which no one has the answer.)
