There are 2 main things that I see on the argument of CD vs FE

Appearances: None of the pairs ever comes up in the books. This means that you have to take as canon either a family tree with no history attached to it other that first and last names, or an actual proper backstory written by JKR. It confounds me that people will shun pottermore as "not canon" yet will happily take the first option as if it somehow held more relevance.

Timeline: We only really had a couple of pieces of info relating to James' parents before pottermore. One of them, related to us through word of god, told us that they were already old when they had james, even by wizard standarts. Reminder that it's not unusual to see a 100 year old + wizard alive and kicking it throughout the books. With this in mind, Charlus and Dorea do not fit, given Dorea is marked as having died at the age of 57.

THis is stuff that can be garnered after the pottermore text came about, and you can make the argument that in retrospect its easy to dismiss charlus and dorea, but it's just been ingrained in the fandom for too long for most people to do so. However, even before pottermore debunked it, it still didn't make any sense. Besides the previously mentioned timeline issue, there's the fact that making them harry's granparents would make sirius and james directly related, as would harry. A fact never once brought up by the books, and wasn't there plenty of opportunity to do so, considering the ammount of times Sirius brought up both his family and James? It seems like a no brainer to mention that were it true. But, the thing that always made me dislike that theory, si that it almost takes away from Sirius and James' friendship, and even more importantly, the relation he built with James' parents. They'd just be his great uncles, were the theory correct.

And, as someone mentioned earlier in this thread, something I never really gave much thought to, Dorea being "nice" enough to give a second home to Sirius could very well be enough to blast her off the family tree tapestry, which hadn't happened. Not the give home to sirius per se, but the fact that clearly sirius considered her and her husband to be different enough from the rest of his family to actually like their company.

I was genuinely worried the first time I heard JKR was gonna publish a pottermore text about Harry's family on pottermore, because I thought it would confirm this senseless theory and I'd have to either ignore a worldbuilding text, or just accept that it made no sense, but thankfully she didn't.
