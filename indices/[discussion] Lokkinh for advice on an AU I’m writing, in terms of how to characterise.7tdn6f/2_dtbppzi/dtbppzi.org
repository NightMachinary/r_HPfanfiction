Half of them saw nothing wrong with genocide. If you want to stay close to canon characterization you have to accept that half of them are scum, Malfoy and Snape included. Good people do not wish for a mass murdering war criminal to return or join his cause to cleanse an ethnic group from their society.

Rowling is being contradictory when she says that not all Slytherins are evil because the only canon example of a truly good Slytherin we get is Andromeda Tonks.
