I'll argue against that. I think most of the Slytherins are selfish cowards who have no idea what they're talking about, but that doesn't make them bad people. I mean look at Malfoy, he acts like a dick throughout the entire series. Yes, he's entitled and arrogant, but once the dark Lord comes back, he realises the beliefs he was raised on have been wrong and he realises the dark lord isn't actually all that great. However, it's now too late to back out, he's a death-eater already, if he disobeys or runs away, his family will be killed.

I'm not saying that Malfoy is some saint, I'm saying he's been raised in a certain way and he doesn't make much effort to change his way of thinking. He's close minded and foolish, he's not evil. He's been convinced he's fighting for his way of life, why shouldn't he? He doesn't wish to â€˜cleanse an ethnic group', he's been convinced he does, but when he sees what that means, he realises he's in the wrong and that it's not all that it was brought up to be.

Perhaps I'm being too soft, but it's incredibly hard to reject something you've been raised to believe for your entire life. You can't expect every person in the world to give up everything they have just to fight for what's right, that's why the people that do are heroes.

So I don't think Rowling is contradictory in saying not all Slytherins are evil. The whole point is that there isn't a black and white good and evil. Slytherins are cowardly and selfish, but I don't consider that bad in its own right. By the time most of Harry's Slytherin classmates actually realise how horrible Voldemort is, it's much too late for them to back out. You might argue that they shouldn't follow a murdere in the first place, but I'm sure they've been told of the evils of the other side, Aurors were allowed use of the unforgiveables after all, will pureblood fanatics not tell their children of how the aurors and the order destroyed families on the dark side, telling their children the death eaters killed in self defence, seeking vengeance for their fellows?
