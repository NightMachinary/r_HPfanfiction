Saying that you haven't really given much thought to why the students start at 13 rather than 11 indicates to me that maybe you should. I think figuring that out and getting a solid rationale behind that will help you with your characterization question.

How are children educated pre-Hogwarts in your AU? Homeschooled? Do they go to regular school? Perhaps the extra two years is to give magical children more contact with the "outside" world and a greater understanding of Muggle society. What do the pureblood families think of that? Is this a recent change or has it always been this way? Also, by making 13 the minimum age, you're going to have a bunch of 20 and 21-year-olds running around Hogwarts. How are you going to handle that? They will be adults, not children. Is the Wizarding age of majority still 17? What's to keep them in school after that?

I think you're doing a little bit of cart before the horse here. Figure out how this seemingly minor change will affect your AU and personalities of the students and then I think you'll have an easier time figuring out your characterizations. Good luck in your writing!
