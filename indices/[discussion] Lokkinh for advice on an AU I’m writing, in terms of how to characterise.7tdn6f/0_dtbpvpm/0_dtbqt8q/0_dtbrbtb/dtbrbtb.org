I like the idea you have about the OWLs and the NEWTs. Regarding max age of 20, keep in mind that Hermione was 12 shortly after the start, so her and others would be 21, but that's more of a minor nitpick.

I'm a seat of the pants writer, too, so I get you about the planning. Just make sure you're concrete on the core idea and you'll be all right.
