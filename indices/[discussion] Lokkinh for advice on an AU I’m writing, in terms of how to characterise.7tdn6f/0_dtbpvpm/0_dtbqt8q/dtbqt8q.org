I'll admit I haven't thought this out at all, but I've never been one for planning things out, otherwise I never get to them, constantly rethinking everything I've planned. I tend to be fairly decent at writing without a plan so I guess that's why I'm doing it. Though I have thought some things through, so it's not like everything is up in the air.

In terms of education first, magical children are homeschooled as usual prior to their entering Hogwarts. I do not think any pureblood, by this I do mean families which wouldn't be labelled as â€˜blood-traitors', would consent to sending their child to muggle school and then, it would create too many risks for the exposure of magic to the rest of the world. So yeah, no greater understanding of the mugglel world.

In terms of age, if they all enter at thirteen, the maximum age they'll be is twenty. The way I see it, the OWLs work as a first phase of exams after which students can choose to leave Hogwarts, since they'll be seventeen at the time. The NEWTs would then be dedicated to more specialised fields of study, making Hogwarts double as a high school and a bit of a university/college since there isn't a centralised system for higher learning in the magical world.

So I guess I've though got these aspects out, it's really only when and why they decided to rule for Hogwarts begging at thirteen that I haven't decided yet. Typical of me not to think of the reasons behind the primary driving point of a plot..I guess when I think that out I'll manage to write more, I'm just feeling particularly stumped today, thanks for the advice though.
