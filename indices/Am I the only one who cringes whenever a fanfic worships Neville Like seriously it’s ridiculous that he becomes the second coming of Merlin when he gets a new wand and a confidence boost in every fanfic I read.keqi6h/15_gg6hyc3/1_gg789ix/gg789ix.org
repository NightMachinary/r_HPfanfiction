Harry Crow and Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness and the main two I can think of. They might be awful in their own ways but they are still insanely popular (or at least for many years they were) it's faded recently, as more and more people are told about how problematic they are. Regardless, I think they made a deep impact on canon, especially when it comes to the Warrior!Neville trope.
