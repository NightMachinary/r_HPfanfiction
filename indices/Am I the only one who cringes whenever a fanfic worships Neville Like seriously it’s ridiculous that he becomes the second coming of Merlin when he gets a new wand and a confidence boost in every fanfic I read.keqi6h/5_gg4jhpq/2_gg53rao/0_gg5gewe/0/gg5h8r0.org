I mean, the times I liked it they made a whole lot of things different.

Harry was far away from all the Voldemort stuff, only having a connection through James that is an Auror. So he has a different set of friends, with a different House and different adventures, while Neville faces some of the plots in different ways.

In other he goes through a different childhood with Andromeda because he doesn't need any protection and his home was attacked by the DEs.

It opens up a whole lot of possibilites for both characters.
