I don't think loser is a good term. He was shy, had low self steem and all of that was made worse because he had a Wand that did not fit him.

He wasn't raised well, and probably lacked social skills, him learning that at school if people want to help him make sense.

He also become confidant and brave enought the Sword of Gryffindor deemed him worthy.

It makes sense for him to know more about customs than Harry, and more about high society ones than Room.

Eh, him taking down Bellatrix is a bit too much.

I dislike the Perfect-Hermione trope WAY more.
