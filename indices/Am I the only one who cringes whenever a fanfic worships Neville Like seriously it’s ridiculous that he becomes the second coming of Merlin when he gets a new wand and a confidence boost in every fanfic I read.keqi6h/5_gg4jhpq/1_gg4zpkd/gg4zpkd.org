Criticising Luna shouldn't be a brave move, but it often feels like it is...

But the truth is, Luna ain't all that. She is the weird conspiracy-theorist kid that most people would get frustrated with and/or avoid.

I have in fact dropped fics that I was otherwise enjoying because they made Luna too prominent a character, or a main love interest. Yes, Luna is a character with great potential, but fanfics tend not to give her any development, they just treat her as totally perfect as-is, and anybody who criticises that (like Hermione) gets treated as though they've been unreasonable or cruel.
