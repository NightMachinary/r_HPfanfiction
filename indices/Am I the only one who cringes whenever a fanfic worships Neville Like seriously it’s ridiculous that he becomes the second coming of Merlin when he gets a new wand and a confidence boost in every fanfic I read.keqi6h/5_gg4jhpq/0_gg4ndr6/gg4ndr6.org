The big issue with Luna is that she cannot just be weird and quirky or an introvert. She is some super-powered Seer that can predict fifty different outcomes seconds before it happens - yet did nothing about the Chamber of Secrets, or realised that Sirius was innocent, or realised that the Triwizard Tournament was a trap for Harry. If not a Seer, she is the only bullied person in Hogwarts (bullying is insanely common in boarding schools) and that means she must be protected. Luna is such an interesting character made awful by fanfics.
