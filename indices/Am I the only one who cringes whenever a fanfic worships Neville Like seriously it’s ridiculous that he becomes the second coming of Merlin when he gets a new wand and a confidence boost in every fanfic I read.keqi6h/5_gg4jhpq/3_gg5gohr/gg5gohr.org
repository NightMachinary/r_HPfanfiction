I'm planning to do a percy jackson/harry potter crossover fic sometime, and it has percy and his friends come to hogwarts during the Deathly Hallows. Now, Harry, Ron, and Hermione don't feature in it much until like the second half, since they're on the run, so Percy doesn't really meet them until then, so I planned to make him befriend Neville (who is a lot more confident than he was in his first year) and Luna. But I don't reallly want it to turn into one of those fics that you're referring to. Does that seem okay, or does it 'place him on a pedestal', as you put it? Just looking for advice here.
