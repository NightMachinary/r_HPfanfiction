Worship? Yeah. Just like with Harry. Fics like A Marauder's Plan, tho? Where they build his character, confidence and don't bash other characters (read: Ron) or instantly make him Harry's best friend? Nah, that shit is amazing. I see Neville (and Luna) as characters so underdeveloped in canon, that there's just a lot of room to work with. Why couldn't he be confident if someone showed Augusta her mistake giving him Frank's wand? Why can't he be good at other subjects (as McGonagall stated he got better after having his own wand) beyond herbology? And yeah, he's a shy boy, but why does that mean he can't have friends at all? I hate that people think like this and want him to perpetually be a side character when he can be much more. And Luna? Why does she have to be the bullied excluded kid bc she's eccentric? Why can't she be a Seer? Not super powerful, but still there, somewhat like Trelawney. I don't agree with people bashing Hermione, but I also don't like how narrow minded Hermione can be sometimes, it's about balancing things. Neither have to be invisible in fics. They have a lot of potential.
