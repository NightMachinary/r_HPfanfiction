  comparing her to Luna she comes off as narrow minded.

No offense, but I honestly don't get why people say Luna is open-minded. She's basically the epitome of close-mindedness. When her ideas are challenged, she gets aggressive and refuses to listen to the other person's argument no matter how much evidence they have. She even tries to accuse Hermione of being close-minded for not believing in her conspiracy theories, even though Hermione was willing to listen to her if she had any actual evidence to back up her claims.

Believing in crazy conspiracy theories doesn't make someone open-minded. If that were the case, flat earthers and anti-vaxxers would be our top scientists.

Hermione, on the other hand, seems to be much more open-minded than Luna, since she'll actually change her beliefs once she's presented sufficient evidence. I think that a lot of people forget that the definition of open-mindedness is receptiveness of new ideas, which Luna is the antithesis of.
