Oh, don't get me wrong, I love Hermione, I just think when it comes to stuff that aren't purely logical, like Divination or magical creatures (like Thestrals, which she didn't really believe in) she can be quite closed to it and even dismissive.

Does that makes her a monster? Absolutely not, it makes her an interesting character, but comparing her to Luna she comes off as narrow minded.
