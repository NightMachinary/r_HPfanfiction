Good you are referencing the books. If you may remember Neville's character has been apart of many of the books.

In the first book he was with Harry in the forest of Death. Sure he didn't play to heavy a role however he did break the rules to try and warn Harry and Hermione about Draco trying to get them in trouble. That's pretty ballsy for suck a weak-willed character and he stood up to Harry, Ron and Hermione when they were going after Snape and the Stone

In the Goblet of Fire they showcase Neville's interest in herbology, nothing to exiting however it did help Harry in the long run

In the Order of the Phoenix Neville was apart of the group who stormed the Ministry of Magic when it was taken over by Tom Riddle.

In the Deathly Hollows never was the leader of the DA when Harry, Ron and Hermione where locating the horcruxes. Secondly like I said earlier he not only stood up to Voldemort when everyone thought Harry was dead but endured torture from the burning sorting hat and killed Nagini.

All in all he isn't a perfectly fleshed out character however when you build a world around only one person or a small group everyone else tends to be left out.
