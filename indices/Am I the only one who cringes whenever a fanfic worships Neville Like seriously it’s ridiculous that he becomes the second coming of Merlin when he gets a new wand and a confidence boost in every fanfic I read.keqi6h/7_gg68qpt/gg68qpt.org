I like when fics expand on Neville and his character, but it has to be done in moderation and throughout the fic. I can see how people can see it as annoying when a fic hero worships Neville, but I think Neville is often overlooked since his character could of been built more on in Canon. There is a reason he is a gryffindor. Some fics do a great job of exploring Neville's character and not all of those fics hero worship him. Also, maybe its just me, but even if I feel the fic hero worships him a bit, it most often can be looked over for the plot in the story. You definitely see and have a harder time ignoring super powered harrry fics, then fics that worship Neville. Not to say that super powered harry fics are bad, because I have seen many with a good plot and cool magic theory, or world building. Just trying to make a comparison to make my point. Thank you for bringing this up as a discussion, it is interesting and fun to look and think about everyone's opinion on this trope in fanfiction.
