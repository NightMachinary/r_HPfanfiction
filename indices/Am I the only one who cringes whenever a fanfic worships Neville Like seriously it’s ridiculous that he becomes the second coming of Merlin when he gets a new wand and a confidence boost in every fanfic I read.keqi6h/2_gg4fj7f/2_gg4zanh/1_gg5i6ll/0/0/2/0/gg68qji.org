Apologetic yes, but that doesn't really mean she liked him. Smiled at him and stuff but that doesn't mean she'd be willing to go out with him. It just meant they knew each other.

The basis of their relationship in book 5 was the fact that he found her pretty and she wanted closure over her dead boyfriend. We don't even really know if she liked him for him.

So yeah it's really a "we'll never know".
