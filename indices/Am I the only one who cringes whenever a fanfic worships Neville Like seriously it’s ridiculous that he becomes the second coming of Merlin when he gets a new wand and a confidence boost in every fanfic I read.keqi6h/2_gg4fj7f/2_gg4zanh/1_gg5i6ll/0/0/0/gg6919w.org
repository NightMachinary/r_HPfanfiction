It's the smart thing to do but it's actually very difficult to ask a girl out, especially one who is senior to you, and one that you've never really spoken with. Age might not matter, but in school, especially if you're the boy and the younger one, it plays a big factor and makes things difficult.

Ask plenty of guys, many would have had crushes on seniors, but of them, very few would have approached their crushes.

The fact that Harry asked cho in itself is something we need to respect. That takes courage.
