The only counterpoint regarding Neville's sociability is the "social courage" aspect, which was in GoF, when Ron and Harry were incapable of asking a partner to the Yule Ball, Neville summoned the sense and self-confidence to a) identify someone within his league* and b) just ask them before it was too late.

*Ginny is within Neville's league at this point because she cannot go to the Yule Ball unless invited by an older student. Neville is exploiting this circumstance - which is a social skill.

As for the rest of your analysis, I totally agree. Neville is not than interesting a character, and he tends to come to the forefront only when fic writers want to remove Ron from the plot, but still feel that Harry needs to have a pureblood male best friend in Gryffindor...
