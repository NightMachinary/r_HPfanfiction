You're right. In that sense Neville is more courageous than those two idiots. He actually asked Hermione first, got shot down, swallowed the rejection and asked a person who was desperate to go. Smart move. Not exactly noble, or how he is portrayed usually but worked for him. I'd like to think Harry was a coward but I can't blame him. He had a person in mind he wanted to ask but he hadn't spoken to her ever and she was older so yeah. In school that actually does matter a lot.

He probably should have been smarter, moved on, but we've all been teenagers with less than intelligent ideas so I can't hold it against him.

Kudos to Neville on that bit though. I completely agree with your point.

But it also raises a question. If he was capable of social courage as in this instance, and I agree with you that he did display it.. then his lack of support towards Harry during CoS and GoF, was because he didn't believe Harry or he was a sheep? I really don't know which one.

Neville is a character whose glorification has constantly puzzled me.
