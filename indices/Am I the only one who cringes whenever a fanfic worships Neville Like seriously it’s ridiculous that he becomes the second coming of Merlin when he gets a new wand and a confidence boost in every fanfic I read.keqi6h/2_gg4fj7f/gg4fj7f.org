No, you're not the only one. I've stopped reading a lot of fics because of this same reason. It's really annoying to see and to read. It really serves no purpose and its just wish fulfilment of most people because the actor was more attractive than rupert Grint or the authors are riding the Ron Bashing wave to promote their story, and hence need to push Neville in to take his place.

Most authors have a fundamental misunderstanding of Neville. They think if Neville is there, Harry will be more open, have more friends, learn more about "wizarding culture". I disagree because Neville primarily had no friends through 6 years of school. His popularity only rose in the end when he led the resistance within the school. He isn't social. He is ready to fight just as often as Ron. If he's willing to be more social, it's probably because he's a push over who is desperate for friends and will do whatever peer pressure tells him to do. Also they think Neville is loyal. He isn't. Neville didn't do shit for Harry during his problems in second year or fourth year. It's all based on trying to glorify s character that was never there. So yeah, it's bloody annoying.

But Matthew Lewis is hot so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
