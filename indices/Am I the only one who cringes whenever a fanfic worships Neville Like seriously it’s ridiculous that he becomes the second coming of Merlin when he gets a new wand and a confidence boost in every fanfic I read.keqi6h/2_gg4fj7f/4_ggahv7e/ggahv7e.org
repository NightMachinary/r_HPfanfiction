  Also they think Neville is loyal. He isn't. Neville didn't do shit for Harry during his problems in second year or fourth year.

He wasn't even Harry's friend back then though. Why would he be loyal to someone who barely interacts with him and never sticks up for him? When he was jinxed by Malfoy, Harry and Ron literally laughed at him instead of helping him like Hermione did. Whether or not someone is loyal to a stranger should not be an indicator of their loyalty.
