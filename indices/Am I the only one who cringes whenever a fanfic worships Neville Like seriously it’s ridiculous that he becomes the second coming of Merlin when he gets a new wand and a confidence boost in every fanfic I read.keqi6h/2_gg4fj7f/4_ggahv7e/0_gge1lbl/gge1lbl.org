Harry actually didn't laugh. He gave Neville a chocolate frog and encouragement. Also helped Neville with his remembrall.

The main point, I'm trying to make is, they weren't strangers. They were housemates who had interacted with one another more than other housemates. Even if you don't care for your housemate that much, if you saw a kid get treated like Harry was being treated, and you had experiences with him where he was decent to you, would you just disappear? If you still think that isn't a lack of loyalty , then it simply points towards a lack of decent.
