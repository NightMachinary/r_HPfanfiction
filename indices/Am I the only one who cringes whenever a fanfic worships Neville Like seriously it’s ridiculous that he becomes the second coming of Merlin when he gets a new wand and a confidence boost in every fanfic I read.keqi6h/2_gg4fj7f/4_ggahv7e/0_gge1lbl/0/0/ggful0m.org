Ok, I was mistaken, Harry laughed. Do you mind quoting what happened after the counter curse was given? Seeing that you enjoy producing quotes.

And actually feel free to find more incidents, I'd be happy to read them and change my opinion if necessary.

Neville was lucky not to be expelled for his stupidity in PoA. Thanks to him a mass murderer got into their dorm. With a knife and appeared to have been trying to attack a student. A murderer that Harry believed was after him. You almost get killed because one guy can't keep a track of his belongings and you'd be willing to stand up for him and help him? Please try to be a bit more honest.

You say Harry laughed at him multiple time. Where are the multiple times? I'm only seeing one. Once if first year. Tell me the other instances.
