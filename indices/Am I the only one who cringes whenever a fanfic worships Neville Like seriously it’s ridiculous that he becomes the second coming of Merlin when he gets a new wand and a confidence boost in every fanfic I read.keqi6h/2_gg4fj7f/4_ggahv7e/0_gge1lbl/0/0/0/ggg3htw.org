  Do you mind quoting what happened after the counter curse was given? Seeing that you enjoy producing quotes.
#+end_quote

Is this supposed to be a "gotcha" moment? Because it really doesn't work, seeing as you used that argument in your first reply to me. I only like quoting things to provide /new/ information.

#+begin_quote
  And actually feel free to find more incidents, I'd be happy to read them and change my opinion if necessary.
#+end_quote

Ok, it seems I underestimated how hard it is to look for quotes for incidents that I can't recall off the top of my head. I'll edit my comment later to provide them.

  You almost get killed because one guy can't keep a track of his belongings and you'd be willing to stand up for him and help him?
#+end_quote

I would be willing to help him and let him follow me around. McGonagall even said that that was what classmates should do for him. If Hermione, a 14 year old, is nice enough to help him, why shouldn't I? In my opinion, it would be pretty cruel to leave him outside of the common room and isolate him like all of Gryffindor did.

  You say Harry laughed at him multiple time. Where are the multiple times? I'm only seeing one. Once if first year. Tell me the other instances.
#+end_quote

Ok:

#+begin_quote
  “Yeah, I know!” said Ron, some of the color coming back into his face as he started to laugh. “He told me after Potions! Said she's always been really nice, helping him out with work and stuff --- but she told him she was already going with someone. Ha! As if! She just didn't want to go with Neville ... I mean, who would?”

  “Don't!” said Ginny, annoyed. “Don't laugh --- ”

  Just then, Neville caused a slight diversion by turning into a large canary.

  “Oh --- sorry, Neville!” Fred shouted over all the laughter. “I forgot --- it was the custard creams we hexed --- ”
#+end_quote

There are various other instances of Harry and the rest of the Gryffindors laughing at Neville (and this time, I actually can produce more quotes if you want), but it's a bit redundant to list them all.

Also, laughing isn't the only way to bully Neville. The way he treats Neville even when nothing is happening is just awful. He never defends Neville when Ron insults him, he ignores Neville when he's speaking, he stands up Neville to go to Hogsmeade, he thinks of Neville as incompetent and pathetic, and he was even amused when McGonagall was tearing into Neville in GoF.
