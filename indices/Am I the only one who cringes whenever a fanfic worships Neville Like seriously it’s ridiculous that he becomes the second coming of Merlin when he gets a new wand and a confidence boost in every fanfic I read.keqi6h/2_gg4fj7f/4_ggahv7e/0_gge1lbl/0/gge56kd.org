  Harry actually didn't laugh.
#+end_quote

No, he did laugh almost every time Neville was jinxed by Malfoy. Here's an example:

#+begin_quote
  At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower.

  Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling.

Do you want more quotes? Because there are multiple times where the exact same thing happens, so it wouldn't be too difficult for me to find them.

#+begin_quote
  Even if you don't care for your housemate that much, if you saw a kid get treated like Harry was being treated, and you had experiences with him where he was decent to you, would you just disappear? If you still think that isn't a lack of loyalty , then it simply points towards a lack of decent.

So it's fine for Harry to leave Neville in the dust in PoA when he was barred from being told the passwords or for him to laugh about how Neville was so pathetic that Hermione lied about having a date to avoid going with him in GoF, but it's suddenly horrible for Neville to not go out of his way to defend Harry? He was never described as "disappearing" or avoiding Harry in any way. He just didn't defend the boy who laughed at him multiple times when he was jinxed and bullied, abandoned him when he was ostracized by all of Gryffindor in PoA, and mocked him behind his back. If you still think that Harry being decent to him once or twice is enough to make up for all of that, then /that/ simply points towards a lack of decency.
