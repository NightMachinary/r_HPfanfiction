  Also they think Neville is loyal. He isn't. Neville didn't do shit for Harry during his problems in second year or fourth year.

Loyalty isn't in itself a character trait, it's relational. Your loyal regarding someone or something. Bellatrix is a loyal death eater, she isn't loyal to the ministry.

I take it that in canon Harry and Neville aren't friends. What is he supposed to be loyal to, exactly?
