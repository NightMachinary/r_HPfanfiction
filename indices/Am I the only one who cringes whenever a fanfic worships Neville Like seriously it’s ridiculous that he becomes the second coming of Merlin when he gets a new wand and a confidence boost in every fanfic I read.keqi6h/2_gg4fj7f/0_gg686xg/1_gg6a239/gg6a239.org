Fair point. They might not have been friends, but they were known to each other with Harry having helped Neville atleast on one occassion prior. Not friends maybe, but well known acquaintances on more than friendly terms.

Yet inspite of that Neville never stood up for Harry, supported or helped him even once. But ok, that might not be considered loyalty, but rather a lack of gratitude.

If you look towards loyalty, I see a member of the house being alienated and ostracised by the majority of the school population. (2nd and 4th year) I would hope that other house members would stand up for that. Granted none of the other members did perhaps there might have been an exception in Ron and Hermione, highlighting the fact that Gryffindors aren't really known for loyalty.

He might not be Harry's friend, but he definitely owed Harry. Harry had been kind and helpful to him in the past but Neville didn't really reciprocate it in any manner, by way or aid or assistance. He didn't support his acquaintance or housemate.

Therefore this is my argument to counter the common misconception that is associated with the trope that Neville is more loyal and a better friend than Ron Weasley.

His loyalty and support towards Harry is often assumed, when in fact there is little supporting that fact, but also instances that speak against that idea.
