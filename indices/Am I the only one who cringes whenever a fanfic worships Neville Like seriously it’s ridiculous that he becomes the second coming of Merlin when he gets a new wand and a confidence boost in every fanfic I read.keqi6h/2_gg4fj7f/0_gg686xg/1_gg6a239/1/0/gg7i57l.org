I can think of two instances where Harry was kind to Neville and helped him out while others went content to laugh at him. Remembrall and the Portrait Hole when he had his legs stuck. It's not much, but it's more than most from what we've seen.

They threw the party to celebrate for themselves. They were proud that their house had a champion. However they did nothing to stand by him when the rest of the school pretty much bullied him. No one aside from Hermione or Hagrid actually supports him at that point. While the badges and the mocking went around, Gryffindors were awfully quiet. Taking a reason to celebrate is different from loyalty in my opinion. It can be argued that when he vanquished Voldy the first time, people celebrated. Doesn't mean they were loyal to him. They turned on him pretty fast.
