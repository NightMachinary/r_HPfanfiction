While I do agree with you, there are a few authors that actually take the time to develop him as a character, and it really pays off. In a fic called Rise of the Technomancers which starts shortly after 5th year, Neville is forced into a role similar to what he had in book 7 because Harry was expelled. He's not at Hogwarts to be friends with Neville, he's not even in the country for quite a while, so we end up seeing Neville grow without any interference from Harry and becomes pretty impressive on his own. He also goes through a lot of hardship both from those you'd expect and those you might not, which ends up making him a character just as compelling as Harry despite having almost zero interaction with him until the most recent chapters. Sadly I'm pretty sure the fics been abandoned but damn that author knows how to write compelling characters.
