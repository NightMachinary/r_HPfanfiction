The only time used a strong Neville is if there is something to reinterpret the original prophecy. If prophecy is open ended and the prophecy is talking about either Harry or Neville have them at equal strength. On the flip side maybe have Dumbledore potentially the dark lord. Even if Dumbledore is a good guy he's doing the wrong things for the right reasons. Story wise you could have Snape bring it up. Basically other any potential romance or whatever you have going in the story you would have the prophecy as a subplot. Harry is worried he is the boy who lived and potentially went through hell by dumbledore manipulation, Neville is worried he might be the true boy who lived or a planned backup in the case Harry dies. Dumbledore could be worried he's a monster and became what Voldemort or Grindelwald wanted (basically his multiple positions and political power) and Voldemort being Voldemort. Snape could be basically seemingly showing how Dumbledore could be classified as a dark Lord in the hopes both Dumbledore and Voldemort are dealt with so he could be his own man again.
