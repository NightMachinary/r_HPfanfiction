This is one of the best points I've heard, I didn't think of this at all. It would be very naive to assume everyone who supported Dumbledore/Light did it to protect Muggleborns, just as it's naive to believe everyone who supported Voldemort/Dark did it out of hatred of Muggleborns. This is not to minimize the racism of the Death Eaters/supporters, but clearly the entire Wizarding World is in desperate need of reform. Even the idea of Muggles being exotic and outlandish (ex. Mr. Weasley's cute fascination) can breed some not-okay actions towards Muggleborns. Reform should not only be a way to condemn Death Eaters, but fully squash ignorance of it in the Wizarding World.
