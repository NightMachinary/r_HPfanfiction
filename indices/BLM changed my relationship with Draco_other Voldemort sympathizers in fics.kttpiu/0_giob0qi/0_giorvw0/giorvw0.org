I don't necessarily disagree with your statements about what's needed, but how many people fought Voldemort because they were liberal-minded and egalitarian and actually wanted a better world for everyone, vs fighting him just because he was insane and trying to kill their children?

There might or might not be much appetite for actually reforming the laws as you describe.
