Umbridge delighted in it. She used a quill to basically torture Harry and didn't hesitate to threaten torture and send dementors even pre- Voldemort, with no outside pressure influencing her. There are witnesses for that.

We aren't shown much of Peter's life after joining Voldemort. What we do know is that he wasn't liked by either side: his best friends constantly mocked him and he didn't belong in that group (which isn't to say that they were evil or cruel or anything, he just didn't fit in), and Voldemort and his Deatheaters wouldn't have liked a traitor of friends either, even if he /wasn't/ constantly sucking up. His heart never seemed in it. He never struck me as the type to actively go looking for the weak and helpless remnant of Voldemort; far more likely that he was just running away from Sirius and co and stumbled upon Voldemort, isn't it?

Now, him framing Sirius... all he had to do was be in a place with witnesses and shout something to the effect of you killed them. It doesn't really require a lot of planning and foresight, in principle.
