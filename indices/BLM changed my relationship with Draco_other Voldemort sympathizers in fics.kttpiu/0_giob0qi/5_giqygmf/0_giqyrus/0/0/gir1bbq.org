I can't say my heart would be in serving a racist megalomaniac either. I honestly do think he would have gone to look for Voldemort as a last resort, realizing that a rat long lived as he would look out of place among Muggles while knowing that he wouldn't find peace with Sirius looking for him. So he's trying to stay unnoticed and heard the odd rumor or two, and decides his best option is to stick with Voldemort again.

As for framing Sirius - he laid in wait and cut off his own finger before using a blasting curse to make it seem like Sirius had make him explode! That absolutely requires some planning and foresight.
