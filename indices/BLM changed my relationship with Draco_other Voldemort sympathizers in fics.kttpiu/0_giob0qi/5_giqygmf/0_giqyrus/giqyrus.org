Here's an interesting starter: why would Pettigrew deserve rehabilitation but not Umbridge?

Sure, you could argue that Voldemort scared him enough to reveal the Secret, but the Order members had already suspected a spy. Plus his actions to frame Sirius speak of planning and foresight, not someone panicking out of fear. Then, Pettigrew manages to escape when Remus transforms, but then seeks out Voldemort? And then willingly helps him regain his body? Does his hesitation at Malfoy Manor, which ended up killing him, plus the possibility that he only revealed the Secret under great distress outweigh that in terms of possible redemption?
