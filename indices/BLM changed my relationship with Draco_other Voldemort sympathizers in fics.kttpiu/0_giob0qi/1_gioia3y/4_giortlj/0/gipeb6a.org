Well I wouldn't consider that Pettigrew deserve any mercy. As he had a direct role in the murder of his closest friends and continued supporting Voldemort way into adulthood. (Even bringing him back ffs!) He could have maybe strived for “redemption” (even a weak one) if he expressed any kind of remorse or accountability for his actions. Instead he murdered innocents and framed someone: not much to save here.

But I'd like to read about how exactly he was recruited in the first place and how he strayed so far.
