While I would argue that a better comparison for Draco would be Regulus Black (since ultimately, Draco and Regulus did not fully switch sides, but instead undermined Voldemort's efforts), I do see your point. Especially having canon written from Harry's perspective, I imagine there must've been a population of Death Eaters that were more fearful than actively hateful, and figuring out how to handle them is something else to consider in post-war reform.
