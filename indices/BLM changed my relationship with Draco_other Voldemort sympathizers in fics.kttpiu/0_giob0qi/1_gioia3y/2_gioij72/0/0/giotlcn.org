I loved Another Mask Behind You, and I'm definitely going to check out the other ones on this list. I'm trying to get through Manacled by senlinyu right now, and I like their writing style, but slavery fics are very not my cup of tea whatsoever (lol).

Have you tried the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/661862][Special Branch series]]? It's huge (1.2m), but my favorite Drarry series ever written, and I think the treatment of Draco, Pansy, and Blaise entering the Auror force was done well. I fully recommend!
