I can't remember any in particular, but I also think darkfics where the light wins the war but then things slide backwards after to feel very true to life. "oh, no, of course we wouldn't be so backwards as to round up and kill muggles, but of course wizards are superior and we should preserve the wizard race at all costs, and there were good people on both sides... " Marriage Law fics tend to fit this, but I know I've read others. These only work when the author really truly commits.
