I think one has to differentiate between supporters, collaborators and actors.

Those who did crimes are easy to deal with, because punishment is justifiable. It ought to be done within the framework of existing law- or within war that you're willing to apply to yourselves. This is a good principle from Nuremberg that I think we got right.

Then there are those who didn't commit crimes but who obliquely acted in a way as to support those who did, or those who merely thought that those who were committing crimes were right.

The issue here comes with punishing them. They're not the extremists- they're embedded in society. Punishing them- either with obliviation or deportation (so corporal punishment or incarceration) is going to start to look a lot like screening for ideological purity.

It gets very dystopian very quickly if you can literally have your mind wiped for thinking the wrong thing.

Changing, and winning, hearts and minds, mean both of those need to be in play.

As long as the cultures are separate and the government advocates hiding from muggles and effectively punished interaction with them, there will be negative opinions of them.
