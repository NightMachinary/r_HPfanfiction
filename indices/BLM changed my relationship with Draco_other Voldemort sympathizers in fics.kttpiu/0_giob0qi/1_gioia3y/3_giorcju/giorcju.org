  How do you go about re-integrating former supporters into society again if we don't address what started the war(s) in the first place?

... and how do you re-integrate /dozens of millions/ of people who have been literally brainwashed? Psychological therapy can work, but the US doesn't have /nearly/ enough experts, time and money for this.

In the HP world, the solution is easy-ish: obliviate them or deport them to Azkaban for the rest of their days... but the real world is in for one of a hell of a ride, and not just the US but also /other countries/ like the UK (where Brexit may at least be enough of a reality shock to wake a lot of people up on their own), Brazil, Hungary, Poland or France...
