What would you say would be the right punishment ?

different fics take different approaches.

​

sometimes nothing happens and he just goes on with his life.

​

sometimes he is never punished in a court of law but is essentially blacklisted from society and no one wants anything to do with him.

​

or he does go to prison for a short while

​

theres also his parents most fics have Lucius get locked but Narcissia and Draco are allowed to go home
