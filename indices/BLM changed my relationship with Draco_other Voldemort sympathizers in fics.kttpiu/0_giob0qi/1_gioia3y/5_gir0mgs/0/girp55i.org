I replied to this somewhere else, but I can't find it right now! My favorite punishment is:

Lucius: Life in Azkaban, no parole

Narcissa/Draco: Heavy fines, Ministry seizure of Dark artifacts from Malfoy Manor, wand restrictions for 5 years, monthly check-ins with Auror for these 5 years.

I sometimes like the idea of house arrest for Narcissa, and some form of community service for Draco.
