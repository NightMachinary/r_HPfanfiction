Adding to your questions -- an issue related to BLM/really important to many is prison abolition. Esp in the context of books, where Azkaban is a literal human rights violation, do we want people imprisoned, even people that were Death Eaters? Do we want Aurors to be more proactive in the post-war world when they're like cops in ours? Do we want freaking Harry Potter to be a cop?
