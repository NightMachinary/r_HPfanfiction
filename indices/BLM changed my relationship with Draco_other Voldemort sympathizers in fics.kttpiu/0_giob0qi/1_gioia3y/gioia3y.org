I completely agree with the idea of Draco and other teenagers caught up in the war not receiving the same punishments as adult Death Eaters. And, YES! The other aspects of reform you present are why a redemption arc done well is sooo interesting to read! What /is/ the appropriate punishment? How do you prevent this from ever happening again-- like, for real this time? How do you go about re-integrating former supporters into society again if we don't address what started the war(s) in the first place? How do you go about forgiveness without minimizing actions? It doesn't at all need to be the focus of a fic (when I want smut, I. want. smut.), but I've become much more sensitive to fics that are unable to answer these questions.
