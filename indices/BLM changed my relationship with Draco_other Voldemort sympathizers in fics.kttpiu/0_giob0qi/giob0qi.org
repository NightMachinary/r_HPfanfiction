I get you. I think there should have been serious repercussions for all of them. Actual Marked Death Eaters like Lucius Malfoy should be imprisoned for life as the rule. The only exception I might make is if they're barely of age, like Draco Malfoy. I'm not comfortable with the idea of deciding that a teenager is wholly irredeemable and the best solution is to imprison them for life. There should be accountability but to me that's not the way to go about it. I'd guess that for unmarked sympathizers you'd have to take it on a case by case basis.

But it's not just the actual punishments of individuals that needs to occur. They should have gone over existing legislation with a fine tooth comb, repealing and nullifying anything that results in disparate impact on people who aren't purebloods. And there should be severe social stigma for expressing blood purity opinions. They wouldn't necessarily eradicate it but they could take that shit somewhere else.
