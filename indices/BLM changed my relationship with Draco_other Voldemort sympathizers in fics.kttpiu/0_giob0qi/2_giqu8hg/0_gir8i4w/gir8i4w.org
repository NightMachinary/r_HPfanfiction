His mission was to assassinate Dumbledore, not murder Katie Bell or Ron. Those are 100% on Draco regardless of anything else.

And while the assassination order was illegal, using that as a legal defense is futile since it was established at NÃ¼rnberg that exactly this kind of defence is not valid. It was especially established that, if given an illegal order, the person has a moral choice to carry it out or not, and that he should be punished according to the choice he made.
