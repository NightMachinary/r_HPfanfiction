I agree completely with you, that the post-Voldemort situation in magical Britain can be comparable to the post-1945 situation in Germany.

I have read accounts of family members from that time. All young boys went to the Hitler Youth. You and your family faced consequences that weren't worth it, if you didn't. If you didn't agree, you kept your head down and still went. You could /get/ "volunteered" to the Waffen-SS, if you were unlucky (making teenagers sign contracts under duress). Everyone who was of age and physically capable fought in the war in some capacity. You got out of that if you got injured enough, or if you worked in a job that was relevant to the war effort, say, an ammunitions factory.

Since a lot of people were involved in the war somehow, it wouldn't have worked out to punish every single one of them harshly. Yes, there should have been more of an effort to find and punish the worst offenders, instead of going back to normal as quickly as possible (and it's ridiculous that they're trying /now/ in a hurry before the last of them die. You missed your chance, guys). But not the young people who grew up under the regime and never knew better. Not the ordinary soldiers, or people who were just trying to get through a shitty situation.

But the most important statement I have read from one of the family members I mentioned is that his (pretty bad) time as a POW after the war finally taught him what the Nazis hadn't managed before. He came back broken, bitter and hateful. That's what I would imagine happening to a harshly-punished Draco. Instead of having a job, a family, and being a good member of society, he'd come back after 10-15 years of prison to nothing, and he'd hate and blame the Ministry and the Light side, instead of Voldemort as the actual culprit.
