I think of the Voldemort War and the post-war settlement in terms of Germany and the de-Nazification after the war. In canon we actually see none of that process, we just see Draco at the station in the epilogue, and people bitch and moan here about how unrealistic it is that he wasn't still in prison.

It is realistic. Most members of the SS - which is broadly equivalent to what he was - were held in POW camps for a bit after the war and then released. There was a notion of stripping them of some civil rights but that didn't last. Some Nazis were imprisoned for a handful of years. A few were imprisoned for longer, but only a very few. The number still imprisoned 19 years later was /really/ small. Go on, try to guess how many, I'll wait ...

People here criticise stories that have someone from the winning side get into a relationship with an ex-Death Eater. "It's utterly unrealistic" they cry. Again, it isn't. There are so many post-War relationships out there between German soldiers, even SS, and citizens of the territories they conquered.

I knew someone (he's dead now) who was in the SS. He volunteered as a teenager, because he loved his country and had been told from a very young age that it was in danger from evil forces. He believed the lies, and did what he thought was right. Also, girls liked the uniform, which /really matters/ at that age. It was only later that he learned what he had been part of. He thought at the time that he was doing the right thing by guarding those who were hell-bent on destroying ordinary Germans like him, and by fighting resistance groups.

I see Draco as that misled teenager, who believed the lies. Yes, he loved the power, but couldn't see what it meant outside his own small world. And it's absolutely believable that he could be free, prosperous, in a happy relationship, and even (as he is in some stories) a politician.

Germany healed from its self-inflicted wounds by quickly and sincerely acknowledging what it had done, but also by not going down the route of ferreting out and harshly punishing the slightest infraction. Also consider the Truth and Reconciliation process in post-Apartheid South Africa. The situation in post-Voldemort Britain appears, from what little we know of it in canon, as if it could be similar to one of those, and I'm a bit disappointed to have not found any decent fics that deal with it.

Unfortunately I can't see the Trumpistas acknowledging their errors, which is I think a pre-requisite for what happened in West Germany and South Africa. Mind you, people would have said the same in early 1945 and early 1990.
