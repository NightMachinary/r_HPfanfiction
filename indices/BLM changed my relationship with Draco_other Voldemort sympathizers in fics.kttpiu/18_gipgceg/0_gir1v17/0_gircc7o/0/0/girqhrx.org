Just imagine, a random unnamed Slythering cornering Hermione, Luna or even Harry in an almost shady way and going "I believe You/Potter, I believe he's back and I want to help bring him down/I don't wanna serve him." I mean you would think Slytherins being the cunning an ambitious house a few more would have realized it was a loosing battle with such a crazy unhinged leader and that it would benefit them to be on the right side of the war. Like a Narcissa or Slughorn moment. We know that several Slytherin students went with him to defend the school in the end...
