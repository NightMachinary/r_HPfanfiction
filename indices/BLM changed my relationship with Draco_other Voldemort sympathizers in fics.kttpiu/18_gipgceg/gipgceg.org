Good long redemption buildup is great. I personally also like fics where Draco and some of the Slytherins realize that their parents are basically tying them to eternal servitude to a megalomaniac during 5th year and join DA and either become spies or great duelers that stick by Harry's side. I just find it really sad that DA had no Slytherin members at all.
