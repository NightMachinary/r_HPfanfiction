Thanks for your post! It's very interesting to read how recent events have changed your mind. I think, as a subreddit, we should be able to discuss these types of topics without any name-calling involved (I'm looking at you down-voted posters).

The reason Voldemort was able to return at all was because the ministry never cleaned the slate in the first place. Voldemort was defeated, but the tensions in society that led to his rise were never properly addressed, by Dumbledore or anyone else. Dumbledore predicted that Voldemort would return again, but never did anything to attack his power base.

A mass arrest of any kind post war probably have exacerbated tensions. Even so, who's to say that another figure wouldn't have appeared in Wizarding Britain 10-20 after the events of the last book? Fanfic authors could definitely take a more realistic approach to this. There's just been a war; people are dead. It's unlikely that anyone would be jumping at the chance of holding hands and singing kumbaya.
