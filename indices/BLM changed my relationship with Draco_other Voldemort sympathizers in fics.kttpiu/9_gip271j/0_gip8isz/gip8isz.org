  The reason Voldemort was able to return at all was because the ministry never cleaned the slate in the first place. Voldemort was defeated, but the tensions in society that led to his rise were never properly addressed, by Dumbledore or anyone else. Dumbledore predicted that Voldemort would return again, but never did anything to attack his power base.

This. There should not have been TWO WARS led by the same man, over the same thing over the course of two decades. Some serious reform needed to be done.

Your kumbaya comment made me laugh LOL. It's a really nice fantasy I like to escape into when I want juicy Drarry Hogwarts hookups, but it is entirely idealistic that it took everyone 3 months to start making friends with their former enemies.
