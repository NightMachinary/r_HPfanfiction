  Some serious reform needed to be done
#+end_quote

I think the Muggleborn's in wizard society are a scapegoat for the miserable circumstances some wizards are probably living in. They definitely need reform, if not just getting rid of the ministry altogether. Their population is maybe 1000-2000, what do they need a large bureaucratic institution for? I think a council with democratically elected members, and a few offices at most could to the job just fine.

  but it is entirely idealistic that it took everyone 3 months to start making friends with their former enemies

For sure. The first war resulted in decades of tension, the second war would be no different. In terms of redemption, I think that would be a cool second gen fic. If Potter and company manages reform that prevents more brainwashing in the next gen of purebloods, maybe I can see their kids form a radical movement for change.
