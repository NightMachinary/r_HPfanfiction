I really worry about people who get the Dark Mark tattooed on their left arms in real life. I get that it's fiction and it "looks cool" but still. Red flag.

A large part of why it took me a while to make the connection between "mudblood" and actual racial slurs is the way the adults treat Draco like a spoiled brat instead of a Hitler Youth. "Enemies of the Heir, beware! You'll be next, mudbloods!" And... no reaction from the teachers. They act like the problem is the crowd's presence being disruptive and hustle them off to bed. One of your students just made a death threat with a racial slur! But the adults don't act like that happened so it's tough to see that it did.

Plus, they make Draco a prefect. I've read fics where this was part of a plan to redeem Draco and make him take responsibility. But /still/. What message does it send to the other 299 (or however many) students of the school? At this point in time, Draco is a bully, openly racist, and occasionally violent. But he's rich, his daddy's famous, and he's a Quidditch star so suck it up, kiddies.

It's not until Draco attempts to kill Dumbledore that the adults finally act like there's a problem with his behavior. And even, they don't do anything! The cursed necklace that nearly kills Katie Bell and the poisoned brandy that nearly kills Ron, and they don't punish him. They might not have known that he used an Unforgivable on Rosmerta but they're still responsible for knowing because they didn't investigate. But the adults let Draco continue to create collateral damage. The takeaway is that the moment on the Astronomy Tower where Draco doesn't use the Killing Curse is the pivotal moment in his moral development, instead of the two times he did choose to commit murder and nearly killed Katie and Ron.
