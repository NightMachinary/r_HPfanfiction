  and actual racial slurs is the way the adults treat Draco like a spoiled brat instead of a Hitler Youth. "Enemies of the Heir, beware! You'll be next, mudbloods!" And... no reaction from the teachers. They act like the problem is the crowd's presence being disruptive and hustle them off to bed. One of your students just made a death threat with a racial slur! But the adults don't act like that happened so it's tough to see that it did.

Wait wait wait... how do you think adults treated brats in the Hitler youth during the 30s in Germany? They don't care about racial slurs against Jews (muggleborns) because they hold resentment themselves or at least don't care much about what happens to those folks.

This (talking about HPs magical britain now) is a society in which a large percentage of society is wary of muggleborns, in favor of racial profiling and unfair treatment and all the upper echelons of society own household slaves.

Of course they are not going to stand up against racism! That's the point. It's a shit society, in which Voldemort can rise and have many fans and admirers.

Yes, it sucks that the teachers all look away and are inept in protecting their charges, canon doesn't criticize them enough for it, but it's not weird. It makes sense in context. Umbridge's inquisition squads should make this very clear. HP is not subtle.
