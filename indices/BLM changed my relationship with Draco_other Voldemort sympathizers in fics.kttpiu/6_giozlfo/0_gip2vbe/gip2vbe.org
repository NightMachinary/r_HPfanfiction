This is an amazing point that went completely over my head when I read the series. It brings back the argument that @[[https://www.reddit.com/user/thrawnca/][thrawnca]] mentioned about how there may have been people on the side of the Light that were more worried about how violent Voldemort was rather than a need to advocate for Muggleborns. There were so many chances for a teacher to address Draco's behavior, and for it to get to the level of attempted murder was unacceptable. Many people were complicit. Dumbledore bashing is annoying to me, but his attempts to reform Draco were definitely too little too late.
