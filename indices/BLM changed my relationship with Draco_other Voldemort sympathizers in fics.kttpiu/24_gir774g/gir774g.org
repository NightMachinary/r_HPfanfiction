I'm kinda surprised that people do not see the obvious. While it took me a few rereads/discussions to find all Nazi parallels, it's immediately obvious what the Death Eaters are inspired by. I mean, deporting a minority after sham trials about their racial background could only be more obvious if the deportation was via cargo wagons.

Do it like NÃ¼rnberg. Hang the leadership, lifetime prison for the next worse tier and go down in severity from there on depending on the severity of their offenses. If that had been done after the first war, Voldemort would not have had the core cadre to work with, and even with Voldemort gone, his ideology is not dead.
