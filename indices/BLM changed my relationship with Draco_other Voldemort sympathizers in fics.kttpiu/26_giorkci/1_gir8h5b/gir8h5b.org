I'm pretty sure that the whole Lord Voldemort thing was to entirely distance himself from his Muggle roots. I don't think most of his followers knew who his was, only requiring his parseltongue and magical knowledge and prowess to reinforce their bigoted assumption that he was a great pureblood lord of the most revered and bigoted magical ancestry.

The way Dumbledore chooses to divulge Tom's roots to Harry, particularly in year six, seems as though what he did was uncover a buried past that nobody else knew.
