We didn't see a character who wasn't willing to buy into the idea of wizard supremacy.

It's actually an interesting question as to whether or not pursuing magic is effectively pursuing whiteness in this scenario. It poses the question as to whether or not Hogwarts is a particularly luxurious versions of the Canadian residential school systems to ‘educate' the First Nations people to isolate them from their culture and thus eradicate them.

The question then of ‘do you want to be a wizard?' is like ‘do you want to be white?'. Which, (and I note here, I am the whitest whitey who ever put mayonnaise on a sandwich) whilst I suspect that everyone would take the offer not to be in an oppressed group, there is a lot in the concept of ‘blackness' that I suspect that people wouldn't want to see dismantled. There is a culture- many cultures- there that is its own thing, and worth cherishing. That is to say- I don't think black people want to be white- they'd just like to be treated exactly the same as white people, so race isn't even an issue.

The Statute of Secrecy is literally a law in the HP-verse that keeps the worlds separate. You can't choose to be a muggle who can do magic. You can't come into the wizarding world on your own terms. Effectively, you have to choose between your blackness and white acceptance. Once you choose white acceptance, a degree of othering, micro aggression and stereotyping comes with the territory. Which is also why I suspect the wizarding world forgives.

The pure bloods don't really feel the problem, those who have links to muggledom are so used to being a minority that they don't feel secure enough to really hold anyone's feet to the fire.
