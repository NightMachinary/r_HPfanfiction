I REALLY like this take. Like a lot. It will never ultimately matter whether Muggleborns accept the apology of former Death Eaters; what matters is the moderate's response. Exact same thing is seen in so many real world instances of racism. Thank you for this.

Do you think the series would've played out the same if Harry was a Muggleborn? After reading your response, I'm not sure it would've.
