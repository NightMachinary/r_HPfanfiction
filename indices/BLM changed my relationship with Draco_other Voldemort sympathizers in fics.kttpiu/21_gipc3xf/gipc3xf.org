The fundamental principle of the Wizarding World is segregation. There is, shall we say, a cross party consensus that the Muggles not to be considered fully adult, fully human, fully comprehending etc.

In this context it's not about whether black lives matter- it's a given that they don't, it's about whether mixed race lives matter or the lives of super genius black people could potentially rise to the level of being considered human.

Within this- most of the people who we see redeemed in fanfic are children. Draco and Friends- they're children. Seventeen is so so young. They've not DONE anything yet. They've been told a lot of things- they've been brought up to believe a lot of things- and believing those things has never stopped benefitting them. Why would they change- especially if the nearest thing they've met to a 'black person' is either someone who is at least 'white passing'?

It's not about you forgiving the KKK- the proud boys- the Nazis. It's about whether the moderate white suburbanites would forgive the Trump supporters.
