I think alot of it is bad writing. In order to create some drama the author just has the Slytherin person do alot of terrible stuff. Then, of course, the protagonist finds out, gets angry, and confronts them. But instead of the Slytherin being force to change its the protagonist who has to learns to forgive. And then it rinses and repeats for 20 chapters till they finally get engaged. And never forget the saucy scenes thrown in the middle.
