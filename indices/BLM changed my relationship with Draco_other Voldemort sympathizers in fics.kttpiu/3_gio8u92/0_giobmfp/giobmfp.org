'But instead of the Slytherin being force to change its the protagonist who has to learns to forgive.'

THIS EXACT SENTENCE. Or when Harry is the fics protagonist, there's usually some rendition of "[insert former redeemed death eater] didn't kill your parents. Voldemort did. Chill out, Harry." LIKE ????????

I do agree that bad writing contributes to it, as well as certain tropes not leaving a lot of room for a good redemption arc in their nature. Better writing yields better character development, both with Light and Dark characters/relationships. I'm hoping to return to the days that I can turn my mind off to read a nice little one-shot without thinking "....that's it? That's all he had to do to be forgiven? Really?"
