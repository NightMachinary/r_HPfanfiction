I didn't need any riots in my neighborhood or being called the gamer word to be pissed that the Malfoys (and Death Eaters in general) weren't punished the following way:

- Anyone having a Dark Mark gets executed (anyone who received it before the age of majority (in the magical world it's 17 years, IIRC) gets a few years jail time (not Azkaban. Actually, having dementors as prison guards is a form of cruel and unusual punishment and so is the dementor's "kiss"))
- Their house gets either demolished or sold to the highest bidder
- Their wealth (except some kinda bare minimum) gets confiscated
