Not OP but harsher De-Nazification would have been probably immediately worse but better for Germany and the West overall.

Because of political reasons (the Soviet Union and communism becoming the next big enemy), many high ranking Nazi officials and war criminals got off scott-free and were allowed back into government service which led to a proliferation of far-right and Neo-Nazi elements in the police and military.

Worse, is that the image of Nazi Germany, ecspecially its military has been rehabilitated in popular Western media. The Wehrmacht and the SS both performed atrocities, but only the later was declared as a criminal organization while the former, as part of a campaign to justify forgiving war criminals I just mentioned earlier.

The Wehrmacht went from being a overstretched, bloated military with a reliable core, that frequently participated in war crimes led by overly ambitious tactically smart but strategically foolish generals having to constantly be reeled in by Hitler to achieve manageable goals (at least while Germany was on the offensive until 1942), to being the best military in the world which did not commit any war crimes with the best generals who were extremely hyper-competent but lost because of the Soviet “Asiatic Hordes”.

More could be added but I can't be bothered now since I am on my phone.
