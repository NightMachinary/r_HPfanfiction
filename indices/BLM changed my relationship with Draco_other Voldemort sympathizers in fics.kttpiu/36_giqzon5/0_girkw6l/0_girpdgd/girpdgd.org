I mean, part of why I had the

#+begin_quote
  On one hand, I want to say, "Dude, this is only occurring to you now?" and reference, for example, the Hitler Youth.
#+end_quote

response was because I forget that not everyone reads mostly canon compliant stuff. When I wrote the Drarry comment I quoted I was (outside of that paragraph) quite careful about disclaimers like "canon resembling" but it just didn't occur to me now (even though you pointed out that Drarry is something you read). I got a little better towards the end of that version of my comment (I deleted what I'd initially written and started over) but I didn't really reflect on what that meant. And so:

#+begin_quote
  This may also have been some naivety
#+end_quote

It's not naivety... it's the limit of what a conditional reasoning machine is capable of. As you say, you came across Harry Potter in one context and then exposed to a new stimulus, updated how you thought about it. That's how reasoning is meant to work (just ask Rational!Harry from HPMOR... no, I'm not being ironic here, this is something I think HPMOR gets right, it's just that HPMOR doesn't really follow through on that). We can't expect ourselves to draw links between disparate things we know /by thought alone/... at least, not in every case. There is a strong tendency among moralisers (including those who write in peer reviewed journals) to forget (or even outright reject) the relevance of what humans are actually capable of... and I suspect this would be true even if they're the same people who say an otter's eating a sea urchin alive isn't evil, just the state of nature (or, heck, the circle of life).

(Aargh, dammit, it was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/discworld/comments/a6vjia/my_husband_loves_this_vetinari_quote_so_i_had_it/][salmon not sea urchin.]])

To be clear, what I'm trying to say is that every time I tried to justify my first response ("dude, Hitler") all I could really do was find reasons why that was incredibly unfair. All of us are stuck in our own heads, not because we're self-absorbed, but because we cannot use someone else's head to do our thinking: we're trapped by our experiences and the present stimuli.

  Beyond this makes me a bit more hesitant, especially because there is never any discussion of him ever fully dropping these world views
#+end_quote

As far as I remember, published books (counting CC here) do not establish this. What CC does establish is that Draco behaves differently and Harry, Ron and Hermione moved on from him mentally (they've clearly heard of but never had anything other than a passing curiosity about Scorpius in the Epilogue, for instance).

#+begin_quote
  There's less for these characters to apologize for, and it makes the fic easier to progress when you don't have to deal with as much of the "sorry I was racist and promoted violent actions against people like you for 7 years."
#+end_quote

Another oversight on my part. Even though I had that little Blaise theory and thought about, for example, Pansy, Flint and Theodore a bit in that context, I never took it that next step that this is maybe the sort of fic you were talking about reading.

#+begin_quote
  It is, quite frankly, difficult to read, and if I were not reading so I could discuss with my book club, I would not finish it.
#+end_quote

I've never read (nor watched) The Handmaid's Tale but somehow I doubt it's quite as... focussed on the mechanics of the regime as Manacled is. I suspect (or remember? e.g. from an author's note) the author's intention was to make everything seem pretty procedural to make Draco seem less bad. But, like, I don't think you can do much about that set up without imperiusing Draco.

But as I said... I can't actually remember if Manacled's Draco is redeemed as such. Having just skimmed the last normal chapter it would seem that he gets what he wants and Hermione excuses everything which is redemption... based on the principles of (a) he had to do the bad stuff and (b) he was on the right side, in the end.

On reflection, utilitarian justifications are always a difficult situation... you see it in how the fandom's torn on Dumbledore (even though Dumbledore is very, very clearly a paternalist not a utilitarian, the fandom treats him as a utilitarian). As a consequentialist, I guess I generally accept the premise of that basis for a redemption arc but, honestly, I prefer it if they end up dead like canon Snape since it requires less soul searching as a reader (I mean, I finished Manacled because I was reading it, what does that say about me?).
