Thank you for responding to this. I've seen the WW2 parallels for a while in the context of understanding the actual gravity of what Voldemort was trying to do, but I think it took my personal experiences of this year to really think about what comes after the villain has been defeated. This may also have been some naivety, but I came into the fandom very young, and am trying to reassess my views of it.

I do ultimately think that for canon Draco, dismissal from Azkaban is the way to go. Beyond this makes me a bit more hesitant, especially because there is never any discussion of him ever fully dropping these world views (I could be forgetting things from Cursed Child it's been a while since I've read it). And, as you said, Draco has /been/ upholding these beliefs for years. Him joining Voldemort was never far-fetched or shocking.

I think your argument about Blaise is one that I see mirrored in every fic with a Slytherin who received little character development in the canon. Canonically, we can try to guess based off snippets of dialogue where they fell on the spectrum of Voldemort supporting, but because this would be a guess, their punishment following the War would also be extremely up in the air. There's less for these characters to apologize for, and it makes the fic easier to progress when you don't have to deal with as much of the "sorry I was racist and promoted violent actions against people like you for 7 years."

I'm actually in the middle of Manacled right now, and it kinda inspired me to make this post lol. It's my first Dramione fic, and it was the one I was recommended to read the most. It is, quite frankly, difficult to read, and if I were not reading so I could discuss with my book club, I would not finish it. I hate that that form of Draco is supposed to be redeemed. Like, hate hate hate hate it. That may be because I'm used to the Draco Drarry puts out, but fics that make him WORSE than he was in canon do not elicit any sympathy from me.
