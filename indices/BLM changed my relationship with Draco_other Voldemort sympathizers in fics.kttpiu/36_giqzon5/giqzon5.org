This is harder than I initially thought.

On one hand, I want to say, "Dude, this is only occurring to you now?" and reference, for example, the Hitler Youth.

On the other hand, most of the really bad stuff Draco did he did under the threat of not just his life but also his parent's.

But then I remember:

#+begin_quote
  Harry, in contrast, is best friend's with one the major targets of Draco's racism, is a victim himself of the dude Draco's family works for and he almost lost Hogwarts due to the whole Basilisk incident in which I must remind you Draco was on the side of the basilisk. Oh, and Draco also deliberately persecutes Hagrid at every opportunity... although it must be said Hagrid is one of the most under-rated characters in fanfics so this probably isn't particularly relevant when looking at the fandom's evaluation of Harry's issues with Draco and/or Drarry. It might also pay to mention the whole Inquisitorial Squad thing and how much everyone hates Umbridge... Draco clearly didn't!

That stuff doesn't go away. Draco chose to be like that. He may not have had much of a choice when it came to being indoctrinated by his parents, but he chose to be like this. From what we can tell Blaise Zabini has exactly the same attitudes as Draco and expresses them to other Slytherins. But does Harry even notice Blaise otherwise? Nope! It rather positions, therefore, Blaise as a Draco who chooses to do bigotry different.

(Of course, perhaps Blaise just bullied different people to Draco... and Harry doesn't notice that due to his social circle consisting of two people, four if you include Fred and George, with a small expansion after OOTP.)

I think it's unfair to treat Draco as being no different to Bellatrix, Umbridge, Fenrir or people like them. But I also don't think he deserves redemption. He's not like Dudley where the problem is focussed on Harry with a side order of generic bullying; Draco systematically incorporates his political attitudes into his behaviour.

So... to my mind, redemption for (a canon resembling) Draco stops at keeping him out of prison. There's too much baggage on Draco's end and on the part of Harry, Ron and Hermione. If you want Draco and, I dunno, Seamus to become buddies or even to hook up (again, assuming canon resemblance), /maybe/... but beyond that? Draco isn't like Zuko

With the other Slytherins? Well, it depends. I could see something with a Blaise/muggleborn ship where the tension of the romance storyline is that the muggleborn thinks Blaise was a good Slytherin/pureblood, but obviously we (and/or Blaise) know differently. It still seems best to avoid actually completing that pairing as a conclusion of this kind of storyline... it speaks of rewarding characters for meeting the barest of standards of human decency. It's like Juliet, Naked (a film) where (spoilers) Chris O'Dowd's character says to Annie that he wants kids as though the film's just been about how not wanting kids was the problem with the character and therefore where saying this makes it all better. But, really, that moment is just highlighting the character's almost total absence of redeeming features and Annie says, thankfully, "no".

The moment of redemption wouldn't come, therefore, with the kiss/a wedding/sex/other standard romantic crescendo, but instead where Blaise is honest and forthright and accepts that the relationship failed because of his problem/s rather than the muggleborn's hangups or because they were a muggleborn. I guess the redemption could be "telling the truth" but then I sort of feel like we're making the story about dishonesty and thus we're not fixing Blaise's racism but, instead, his dishonesty. Or, alternatively, we're giving him a new reason to need redeeming as we're trying to redeem him.

(Obviously there are alternative characters to Blaise who we can use for this purpose. Some of whom are less problematic or, at least, where we can suppose the extent of their issue was being friends with bigots.)

That being said, I have read Manacled where... ooh, boy... I'm not exactly sure Draco is redeemed but my point is that, contrary to what I've said, it's a Dramione story that is even more fucked up than canon compliant Dramione. But, I guess, at least it's a Draco who is a double agent for the Order.
