can I ask you something?

How did you feel about the Black brothers in the books?

I personally always felt that it was a lost chance that Sirius was shown in the last book as always wanting to break away from his family, even before Hogwarts. I think it would have been more impactful if he had to learn not to be like his family after he was sorted to his own shock into Gryffindor and forced to see things from a different perspective.
