One of those unwritten plot bunnies... how he is the perfect little Black heir when he arrives at Hogwarts and is expecting maybe even demanding Slytherin, but the hat to his endless shock sends him to Gryffindor and is at odds with James (who pulls the other two Marauders to his side or they try to stay out of the way as much as possible) and their prank carrier started with those two going after each other and then when Sirius is starting to maybe question his own belives when confronted with a different world or when his parents turn away from him in shame he starts to see that those beliefs judge people for no fault of their own, James sees those questions and reaches out to teach him. At the beginning quite harsh, then with more and more care...

in a way, this leads to James and Sirius fighting Snape harder. Sirius because he feels he has to prove that he is no longer having those kinds of beliefs and James because in his eyes Snape is doing the reverse of Sirius. He should know better already and is falling into that crowd out of his own desire for power and that stuff...

But I'm just not sure if I would be the right person to tackle such a delicate topic because my life was never so extreme, sure some unconscious biases, but never that hate or that oppression. Never that much of a conflict with my parents or anything like that
