Yeah, it sort of seemed that anyone who was 'good' (e.g. Sirius) was always good. Like he was inherently born with a good value system, instead of showing how value systems are taught and how value systems can develop. Regulus was an interesting character, but underdeveloped and seemed to be treated like a plot point instead of a full person.

So, yeah, I agree with you. Those were two characters that could have been more impactful if their character journey was more developed. I mean, I get it. Rowling was writing a good vs evil middle grade book series. How much detail can she really go in? But still, I think there were definite missed opportunities.
