Same. My parents are lovely, but they have some problematic political/social views. I have been having hard conversations with them, particularly in the past few years. There have been tears on both sides. Thankfully, they were shocked and disturbed by the attack on the Capitol, so I think maybe, /maybe/ they're beginning to come around.
