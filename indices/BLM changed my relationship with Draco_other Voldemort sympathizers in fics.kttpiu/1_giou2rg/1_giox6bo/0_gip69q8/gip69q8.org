I've definitely been feeling more sympathetic to Hermione lately. What must it have been like for her to attend a school where people hated her just for existing? I'm glad that you had her as a role model growing up. I'm also really glad that you made this post. The parallels of Death Eaters and today's society in the US are getting clearer and clearer, and it's good to call it out. Thanks for sharing your thoughts and experiences, and hopefully your post gets a lot of traction because I think it's an important one.

I'm actually re-writing/editing my main series, trying to make the redemption arc a little bit more realistic. It's The Code over on Ao3, pen-name AduroWrites. Would love to know what you think of it.
