Thank you for sharing this. Truly. I haven't been able to draw parallels until really recently, but it makes me happy that you were able to find a form of escape through Draco and the arc he should've received, and that you were able to take that step yourself. It must've been really difficult, and I will not pretend to imagine what it must've been like.

I saw a lot of myself in Hermione growing up (especially being Black in the south), and when I began reading, redeemed!Draco represented a lot of the people who bullied me for my braids and big nose realizing they were wrong and wanting to be my friend. I think my maturation and awareness of the world is why I'm so invested in making sure his redemption arc is realistic, and I think authors like you that are able to understand some of the emotion behind trying to readjust your world view make reading Draco fics so special to me. Would love to read any of what you've written if you're willing to share <3
