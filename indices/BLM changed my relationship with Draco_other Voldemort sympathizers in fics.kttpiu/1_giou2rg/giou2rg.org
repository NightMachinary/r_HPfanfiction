I've written Draco Malfoy fiction since I was a teenager. At first, it was because I found the 'bad boy' narrative compelling (and only the first 3 books were out. Things weren't as grim to my teenaged mind).

As I've gotten older, I've realized it wasn't just the 'bad boy' narrative that was compelling about his character; it was the fact that I saw him in myself. I grew up in a very conservative environment. I grew up believing that 'liberals' were a threat to my country and that my faith was being 'persecuted' and that we were in a 'spiritual war' against the devil. I was part of a youth group that met weekly that said 4 pledges at the start of each service, in this order: pledge to the American Flag, to the Christian Flag, to the Church Flag, to the Bible Flag. I believed what they taught; I defended the teachings; I even debated evolution and global warming with my classmates in school because I was given 'alternative' science books to study. I believed it even when it detrimentally impacted me (conservatives aren't big on women's rights). When I saw the attack on the US Capitol, I wondered if some of the people I grew up with were a part of it, or supporting it from a distance (I have looked through some of the photos, just to see if I can identify anyone).

I started questioning my church more as I got older, around 17, which is also when I started writing fanfiction. I realize, looking back on it now, that I was writing 'good Draco Malfoy' because I didn't see my story reflected in Harry Potter. I wanted to see a redemption arc. I wanted to think that someone raised in that environment could still manage to break free. I wanted it because... well, that's what I was trying to do. As I've become a better writer, I've think I've been able to encapsulate more of that struggle, and show the real consequences of hate and bigotry. I think I've been able to show the struggle of challenging a world view that has been, quite literally, brainwashed into someone.

This is not to say I am sympathetic to the Death Eaters. Let me be very clear about that. Racism, prejudice, bigotry are all terrible and are moral failings; and hate crimes are horrifying. I think new writers and young writers have trouble condemning these values while showing how someone changes - and often default to minimizing these crimes because it is a tricky thing to write. I know I didn't do it well the first time I wrote a Draco fic. And yet, I will keep writing this kind of fic because I need to know it's possible to change; I need to show other people that it's possible to change. In the words of Hamilton, "I picked up a pen and wrote my own deliverance." Writing fanfic has helped me become a better person.
