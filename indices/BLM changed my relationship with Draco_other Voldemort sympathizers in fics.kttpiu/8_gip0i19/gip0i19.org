I remember in recent years seeing the obvious parallels between muggleborn/purebloods with black/white racism. I especially love the mixed opinions towards half-blood and it's similarity towards POCs. And then the most obvious "mudblood" insult and how in the Harry Potter world, it's similar to the n-word.

Seeing these parallels also gave me a newfound disgust towards people who shipped dramione because it the books (and even movies) it's clear that he hasn't improved his bloodist attitude, he just doesn't approve of people dying. I'm fairly sure he /still/ holds onto his prejudice towards muggleborns by the end of the series, and it probably takes a good few years to get rid of them (those kind of attitudes take time to let go even if you think you've gotten over them), but people ship them together /based/ on his canon character - which is really weird and messed up! Maybe it's also because I've never been a fan of the bully and former-victim romance, as we can forgive former bullies if they've truly atoned but to pursue a relationship off of that is ridiculous, so I don't like it, but imo it's very hard to make those fics both non-toxic and semi realistic to the characters.

I think it'd be nice for more people to see the series through these lens and even reevaluate tropes they'd find okay previously but might take some more time to accept in a different context. I know I have!
