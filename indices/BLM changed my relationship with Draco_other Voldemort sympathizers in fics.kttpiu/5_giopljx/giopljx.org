It always infuriates me that so much of Drarry treats him like a "bad boy". The trope is already trash most of the time with glorifying violence and other criminal activities, but that's still much different from being a supporter of genocide. And then what the fuck is up with shipping with the other Death Eaters or Voldemort himself? Only Voldemort ships I can somewhat tolerate are those that drastically rewrite everything to make it so that he's either a politician or an actual revolution leader, and I still roll my eyes almost every time Light and Dark factions and manipulative Dumbledore are brought up.
