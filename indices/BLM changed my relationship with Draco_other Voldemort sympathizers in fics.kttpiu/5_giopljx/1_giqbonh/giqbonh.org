Being honest, with Draco/Harry, anything beyond book five, without major changes, is too late for it to ‘work'. I can easily forgive and forget some of what he did. Children often parrot their parents, which is why churches and religion push for them to join as young as possible. You will not question something if you grow up with it -- even when flaws are presented. Now, it can be done, but it takes an extraordinary circumstance for that to happen. Harry, for example, did not parrot the beliefs of the Dursleys.

Book five is where he could wise up just a tad. Getting Prefect could make him realise that he is growing up and has to be mature. Hell, make it an ancient tradition of pure-bloods or something. Or, have him get wind that his own father was behind book 2 and have him dislike that. Hell, have the Basilisk petrify him. Tom Riddle would hardly care, so it would work out either way.

Essentially, in order for it to work, something has to happen early on. I get that opposites attract. Hell, I had a slight crush on the school bully back in my youth, but if he did nearly as half as what Draco did, I would not even look at him. However, a lot of male/male slash is written by women. It is not a realistic take on an actual relationship.

As for Harry Potter/Tom Riddle. Only if they go to school together and are actual buddies. I do not care if Harry is manipulated. Hell, that works as Tom Riddle was said to be masterful at it. The second Tom kills Lily and James, it should not work. I am sick of those. “It was a war, I do not blame him” arguments. Just stop. Even if I hated my parents with every fibre of my being, channelling the teenage angst of every teenager in the world, I could never date the person who murdered my parents. I could never date someone who accidentally killed my parents.
