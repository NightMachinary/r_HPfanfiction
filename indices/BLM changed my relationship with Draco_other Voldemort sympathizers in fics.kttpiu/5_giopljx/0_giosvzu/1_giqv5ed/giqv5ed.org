I agree on your note, it is really weird. I think it's to heighten the drama of their romance. A Dramione fic has to acknowledge their dynamic from high school, and I think authors exaggerate the dynamic to the extreme (bigot/harassed ---> enslavement) so that it has more effect when it's broken. But yea it is a weird trope.
