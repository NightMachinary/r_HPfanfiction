If Harry is easily putting Manipulative Dumbledore in his place, he wasn't manipulative. Just /once/ I'd like a fic where Dumbledore is/can be manipulative but it's accepted by everyone because one way or another it actually helps them/is for the best of the school or something. I can't write that because I can't write manipulation at all well, but if someone can that'd be nice.
