I HATE when it's done in Drarry fics, but I hate it even more when it's done in Dramione fics. Having Draco's actions be perceived as sexy, rather than horrifying, and having Harry or Hermione--ESPECIALLY HERMIONE--fall in love with him for it is insulting to me.*

Fics where Harry is shipped with adult Death Eaters or Voldemort himself have always come off as crack to me, no matter how well written they are. Forgetting the pedophilic aspect of it, it is just outside the realm of my imagination. Unless it's a complete AU, and characters are made to be the same age, I don't read. And yes, Manipulative Dumbledore is so boring and cringe to me, especially when Harry "puts him in his place." Ew.

*slightly off-topic side note about Dramione because I've recently gotten into the ship: why are the fics I seem to get recced the most fics where she's enslaved by him?????? I'm sure they're very well written, but uhhhh
