In my fic, Lucius gets life in Azkaban (although Azkaban is reformed and no longer has Dementors).

Thanks to Harry's testimony, Draco gets two years of house arrest, and Narcissa is free. And half their assets are confiscated by the Ministry.

Of course some readers are angry that I went so easy on Draco and Narcissa, but I can't make everyone happy ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯
