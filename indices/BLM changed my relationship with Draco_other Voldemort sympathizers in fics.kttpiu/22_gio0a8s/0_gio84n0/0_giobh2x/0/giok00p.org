Seconded! I think my favorite punishment breakdown I've read is:

Lucius: Life in Azkaban, no possibility of parole. Good riddance.

Narcissa/Draco: Heavy fines on the Malfoy fortune, and Ministry seizure of a large number of "family" (Dark) artifacts from the Manor. Wand restrictions for 5 years (not rendering them completely Muggle, but at a pretty severe handicap). House arrest for 2 years, monthly check-ins with an Auror until 5 years of restriction are up.

They were one of, if not the, most prominent Voldemort supporting families, and while Narcissa and Draco should not go to Azkaban, I believe the Ministry will need to make an example out of them.
