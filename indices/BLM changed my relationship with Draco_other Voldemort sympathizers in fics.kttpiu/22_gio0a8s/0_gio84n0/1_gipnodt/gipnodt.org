I don't have the links to back this up rn but I'm pretty sure in canon (if you consider JKR's post-publication writings and interviews canon) Lucius gets a very light sentence by giving information on pretty much all the other surviving Death Eaters.

Cursed Child also supports this-- the super powerful time turner is a result of Lucius's collaboration with Theodore Nott, which suggests Lucius was 1) at home (so house arrest isn't out of the question, but prison is) and 2) not under close surveillance (doubtful the Ministry would have okay'd that sort of project).

Jason Isaac's take on the character was that he drank himself into an early grave, but that he wasn't imprisoned because money protects people (sadly very true).
