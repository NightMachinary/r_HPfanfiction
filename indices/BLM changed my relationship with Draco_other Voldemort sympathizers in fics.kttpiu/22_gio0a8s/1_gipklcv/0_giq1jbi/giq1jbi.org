I really wish I did. Closest one i know of is linkffn(Unspeakable Things), but even that one is mostly set in Hogwarts rather than post-canon. The Malfoys *do* die horribly, but it's just not as fun or as public as I would have liked.

And a lot of the lore is pretty good, though some of it is really tryhard edge.
