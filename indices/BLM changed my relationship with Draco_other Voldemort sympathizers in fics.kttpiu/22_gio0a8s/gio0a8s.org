Nah.

I never really enjoyed the conclusion of HP for basically the exact reasons you're specifying. It infuriated me that the Malfoy family was allowed to live 20 years into the future.

It would've been fitting if they were "randomly stabbed 22 times each in Diagon Alley on Christmas" with no witnesses. That "Former" Death Eaters get to do or be anything but dead is an example of, well...privilege. Magical Britain still thinks, on some level, that the death of muggleborns isn't really a crime. Lucius Malfoy hosted a torture dungeon in his basement and willingly joined Voldemort the first time. His head should be on a pike.

Simple fact is: enabled or not, terrified, abused, or otherwise: anyone that ever bore a dark mark should have been brutalized at minimum. Student status be damned. Kids fought on both sides of the war, and I'm not particularly sympathetic towards Hitler Youth.
