Yes, I agree.

Now let me start this off by saying, I love Draco Malfoy like a son. I empathize with his position, and have buckets of sympathy for the boy. He wasn't even really old enough to understand the full consequences of what was going on. And when he was 16 he was forced to become a Death Eater and go on this suicide mission. He was basically content, or as content as you could be in his situation, to become a murder, probably even die, to protect his family. He was selfless and brave; a fucking Gryffindor till the very end. Although he very much had some Slytherin traits. Thank god for that.

Let me also end that by saying that I constantly educate, write essays, and debate. and everything else I can do for feminism, blm, equal rights(this includes POC, queer people, women, etc.), and any other cause I support. I might be more willing to forgive, whether its because I'm white or because I grew up in the south or because that is just how my personality is, but if you aren't, for lack of a better phrase, over it, then you can bet your balls you will never be treated with anything but contempt with me. I respect your choices and opinions, except when they disrespect someone's very existence.

I know the family he's from. After all, it's a bit like mine. Not as dramatic of course, but still. At base, we're all a bit like him; growing up conditioned to certain views and beliefs, never understanding consequences until it's screaming in our face.

Anyway,

But I absolutely hate it when someone pulls an 'he was good all along'. Like, girl, what the fuck? No he wasn't. Sure, he wasn't evil, just a bit of a git. Sure, he got over it. Mostly. I mean, you can never really fully get over something like that. Not when it was such a pivotal force in his childhood.

Think of it this way

If we are told something over and over again, if someone important to us that we trust is preaching this thing, from our birth and up, then you are going to believe it as gospel. That's just basic psychology. With time and a bit of therapy you can break away from that mindset, but it will be damn difficult.

So this is why I prefer fics where he actually gets an arc.

If that's your thing, then I recommend:

linkao3(Men Who Love Dragons Too Much)

linkao3(Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer For Delinquents On The Run)

linkao3(The Man Who Lived)

linkao3(Temptation On The Warfront)

I was never a fan of how The Man Who Lived is written, it's hard to get into, but it's */THE/* story if you want a realistic arc for Draco. Drarry doesn't come in till much later, but its definitely worth checking out. I'm not exactly sure about Men Who Love Dragons Too Much nor Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer For Delinquents On The Run, but regardless of arc, they are brilliant stories that I definitely recommend. Hermione Granger's is also a bit hard to get into, but mostly because of the fact that it's completely au in the sense that he never went to Hogwarts. However, it is still a brill fic that's worth a read. Temptation is such brilliant all around, check it out.

Not looking to debate on my political nor ethical stances.
