Firstly, I would just like to say you have excellent taste in fics. The Man Who Lived in actually next on my list to read! Temptation on the Warfront is one of my favorite fics of all time, I recently read Hermione Granger's and thought it was pretty good, and I enjoyed Men Who Love Dragons Too Much. I know it's recommended everywhere, but I also love [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816/chapters/37478033][Away Childish Things]], especially the second half of the fic. The way the Wizarding World treated Draco in this fic sat well with me (even though I obviously felt bad).

I think the "good all along" approach to Draco is such a gross copout. I like what you said about the conditioning he went through for all his formative years. It's unfair to expect a teenager to turn their back on everything they grew up with for...what? That was another reason the "good Draco all along" route doesn't work, and simultaneously a reason why I really feel for canon Draco. What did the Light have to offer him, other than a less murderous leader? It's a lot to ask a kid to leave his family, his world views, and his friends behind because...he was afraid of murder? It was a war, and he would've been killing people regardless of what side he was on. There was never a true way out for Draco (yes I know "everyone has a choice," but come on), and I'm honestly not sure he would've taken it even if there had been.

That's what makes a good arc so great to read. I agree, he wasn't truly evil, but I would say it went further than being a git. Where does he fall between these two? I think it depends on how an author has him act and respond following the war, when he has the chance to break away from his family and become his own person. It's really great to when fics take time to think about it, and give an answer.
