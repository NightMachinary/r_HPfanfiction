Thank you for reminding me to step away a little bit and remember why I interact with HP and other forms of media in general, your perspective was really great to read :)

You're right, I think it's super important to draw it back to Harry's perspective in when discussing canon events. I believe when I read the series, the race/purity (they're one in the same to me; something you can't control that others have a historical problem with) was only secondary because Harry was meant to be the hero who rose up and advocated for those who could not. He had to focus on a lot of other shit because of his role as "hero," but for the rest of the Wizarding World fighting in the war, I always pictured to race/purity aspect to be very relevant to them. This may have just been that it was very relevant to me, and I assigned it more attention than it was meant to be given. It's very likely.

And, thank you for reminding me about how fanfiction is supposed to be fun :) I think a\\
small part of while I'm grappling with this because I'm beginning to get into writing myself, and have been looking to other fics to see how they characterize Draco's redemption arc, all the while spending all day discussing politics with friends and family. Perfect storm I guess lol
