I can only speak about US racial issues from a very outside, less than educated, purely observatory standpoint, but here's my two cents on how it can maybe alleviate some part of how you're feeling.

Harry Potter's war does not really boil down to race war, or rather, a purity war, at least not to him. Harry certainly isn't one of the persecuted, and since the book is from his perspective, the purity aspect is often secondary. Voldemort, while the instigator of the radical purists, also has higher priorities, namely his immortality. Does he believe magical blood is superior to non-magical ones? Absolutely. But he's not die-hard enough to consider himself less worthy for being half-blood. Harry and Voldemort's motivations jointly drive the whole story, and they deal with the purism only when necessary, as in when it benefits or hampers them. That might explain why many fanfics don't touch on the issue as heavily as our depressing reality, Harry was never personally targeted because of this prejudice. If anything, in his life he received more bigotry for his wizarding side, from the Dursleys of course.

That said, I don't think you're being unreasonable at all. Maybe some of the fics just aren't that good, who knows. From my experience, good writing can overcome a lot of obstacles. I'm Chinese, and sometimes when I watch "Grave of the Fireflies" or "The Wind Rises", I think "it's cool that you can build your dream plane, but I'd rather you make one that doesn't drop bombs on my country dude", but I get over it quickly because the story is engaging.

Lastly I just wanna say, they're fanfics after all, and fanfics are often idealistic. It must be terribly hard to feel idealistic recently, to resonate with them, nothing wrong with it. I want to say it's gonna be just a phase, but there's no guarantee, some wounds don't heal 100%. But HP fanfics are vast so I'm sure there're cynical ones that fit your current mood. If not, you can always get writing.
