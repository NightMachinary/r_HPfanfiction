I've thought about this a lot recently in reading fics. I'm not generally drawn to good guy, happy-ending narratives anyway (really love Crime & Punishment, Bonfire of the Vanities, "mind of multi-layered villain" type stories).

To me there seems to be a stronger element of classism than racism in DE comparisons. Consider someone like Blaise Zabini, a Black boy with a "famously beautiful" mother (who's killed half a dozen husbands) in Slytherin, so likely pureblooded.

I think that American readers see the stories through an American lens, where race is a bigger issue than class because there's no real American nobility (Kennedys, Rockerfellers, maybe, but they're so rare they don't permeate society, on average you're never going to come across someone 'higher born' than you if you're from the US, just richer). It's different in the UK, where there's still a very real sense of class divide, there's a bigger focus on heritage and who your family is.
