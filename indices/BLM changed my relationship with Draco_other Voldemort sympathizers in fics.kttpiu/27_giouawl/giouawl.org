Yeah the parallels between Harry Potter and our society are that Death Eaters = KKK/Proud Boys/Neo-nazis. That definitely puts Malfoy in a bad light, even though he was a teenager.... sheesh. Its actually worse in HP because the Death Eaters actually took over society and did a lot of terrible things. The characters would be completely justified if they never wanted anything to do with Malfoy ever again even if he was repentent.
