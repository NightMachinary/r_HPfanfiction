Yeah, its a tough situation. I firmly beleive people can and should be given the opportunity to change. But people shouldn't feel pressured to mend fences with people who've been racist/abusive to them or people they love. Part of that journey of becoming a better person is accepting that people you've hurt may not forgive you and making peace with that.
