I live in areanof the UK that suffers a lot of racial tension. Its split white/muslim right down the middle and neither side is particularly fond of the other, so I was brought up on a LOT of casual racism. It was normalised and I never saw issue with it because its simply what I was brought up on to believe was normal. I would use slurs regularly without even understanding thats what they were, instead thinking that was just the word we called them. And don't get me started on how much I hated "SJW culture" because they were telling me pretty much everything I knew was wrong and I was a bad person when I hadn't dont anything wrong. It was a part of my life that happened, I'm not proud, but there is no point in denying it. I'm glad I'm not like that now and I use my experience to try and edcuate others.

While I have been writing my trilogy of Haphne fics, those experiences in my youth seriously helped me build (what I believe to be, anyway) a realistic version of the world they inhabit. Daphne has been brought up on the dark arts, mugglephobia and blood elitism her entire life, thats just how her world exists. And seeing her break out from that mindset through experiencing life first hand is a very slow process, it takes a lot of work and is full of relapses, just like real life. I'm specifically taking my time with her "redemption", utilising every second of it being a trilogy, as opposed a lot of fics that seem to gloss over it all very quickly.

So, I totally get what you mean. A lot of fics seem to treat redemption like it is a reward, when really it requires a lot of effort. Evil (or rather, racism) is not an object that can be given or taken away, its a mindset, a mental structure and belief system, and a very difficult thing to change if the person is unwilling.
