Ahhh thank you so much for sharing your experiences :) Your ability to put your experiences with prejudice into Daphne is no doubt going to make her characterization that much more nuanced and interesting for a reader. Soooooo I would really love to read your trilogy lol!! I haven't read Haphne in years but I've always loved the ship!

LOL I went through a phase in middle school where I was an outspoken anti-feminist, and began to fall into the alt-right pipline (like. I did a presentation on it in 8th grade about how if women were more ambitious, there wouldn't be a wage gap. who tf was I trying to impress lol). Glad we got out of the SJW-owned phase <3
