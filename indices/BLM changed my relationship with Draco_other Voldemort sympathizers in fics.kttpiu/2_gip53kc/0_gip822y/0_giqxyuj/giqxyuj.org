Exactly! I would take pride in not being "politically correct" and wear that title like it was some kind of badge of honour... when really, I was just edgy and didn't understand I could be wrong without being IN the wrong. Through life experiences I was able to change that mindset (I'm actually IN an interracial relationship now), but unfortunately, more often than not a lot of people never achieve this extra level of self awareness. I think that's partially why the boomer generation have held onto such beliefs into their later lives, because they've never lived through anything to conflict it in any meaningful way. And by the time they do encounter it, they've lived their entire life that way and (understandbly) don't want to change.

Thank you! The links to my stories are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7037925/1/Living-Dangerously][Living Dangerously]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13341726/1/Living-in-Secret][Living in Secret]]. Its only the first two of them out yet, I'm still working on the third. A frequent comment I get on them is "So Daphne is an unlikeable Nazi bitch.. why are we supposed to be rooting for her again?" which is.. well, exactly the point. I tried to handle her pureblood purity realistically, which isn't going to be a pretty thing. Hope you enjoy them!
