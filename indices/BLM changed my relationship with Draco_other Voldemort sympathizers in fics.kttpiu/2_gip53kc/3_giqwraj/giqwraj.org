"Muslim" is a religion, not a race. You can be white and a Muslim. You can easily stop being a Muslim just as you can stop being a Christian. But you can't stop being a PoC.

Most racists actually mean "PoC" when they complain about Muslims. And, on the other hand, not everyone who has issues with a religion is a racist - many conservative religious dogmas are very hostile towards LBGT people. Or feminism. See: Evangelicals in the USA.
