In this very specific situation, probably. But the fact that the newcomers to the society are kept ignorant enough that they can easily be discriminated against is a feature and not a bug. Also another way immigrants are often dealt with. It is nevertheless still shocking to me that so very many writers who live in the same world as everybody else can so consistently and repeatedly parrot the words of the likes of Jordan Peterson and Lauren Southern et al and be completely unironic, and have people that say such things be the heroes. And don't even get me started on house elves.
