I've always felt that this specific argument sounds a lot like real life anti-immigrant dogwhistling. You listen to any right wing "pundit" bellyaching about how Christmas supposedly is under attack because some people want to say Happy Holidays as well as Merry Christmas, and these are the exact sort of thing they say.
