Is that not on the society though? How do you integrate into a society without any information or opportunity to learn its customs? And I'm not just talking about someone in the wizarding world offering to teach - I'm including the opportunity to just observe, absorb, and learn.

As far as we know, there's not much of an introduction to the Wizarding World beyond a visit from a professor for muggleborns. I'm guessing the professor accompanies them to Diagon Alley but we don't know since Harry isn't a muggleborn. Based on canon alone, the students are more or less just thrust into the wizarding world while simultaneously trying to adjust to a new school and live away from home for the first time. (That last point might not be of as much significance unless you're American, where the vast majority of schools, regardless of type, are day schools.)

I'd like to think that there is a more substantive introduction than that. During canon, I would assume that introduction is more informal, performed by older muggleborn students and adults that want to make things easier for younger students. But there would still be some attempt at teaching them what they need to know, or at least giving them a chance to learn it themselves.
