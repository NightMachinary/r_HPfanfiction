Well. In the case of Germany, the first solution was to paper it over, and by "it", I don't mean trials for high ranking officials, but an entire people that went along with them. The second solution was a bit of spring cleaning in the late '60s, which together with the dying out of the old generation, resulted in good things. And of course, that "new generation" thing only works if this new generation is not taught the old grievances by their parents, which the German Erinnerungskultur and appropriate teachings in schools since then managed to do somewhat decently.

I would argue it's that combination -- the perpetrators honestly (or, as honest as possible) reckoning with their doings, and the rest of the world accepting this and /their/ new generation choosing to forgive. The European unification is a rather wonderful success story, yes.

As for the Balkans, my knowledge is more limited, but given the nationalist rhetoric in not a few places that can't be conducive to introducing a forgiving spirit in a new generation, plus, perhaps, /only/ 30 years having passed, this might explain the difference?
