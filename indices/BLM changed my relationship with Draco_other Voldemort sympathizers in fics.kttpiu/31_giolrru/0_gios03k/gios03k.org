  It's a bitterness that lingers for as long as the people that experienced it are alive.

I'm a bit cautious on that take. I'm half German half Croat... evidentially, Germany has managed to redeem itself after WW2 pretty good pretty fast (although, I admit, we do have a growing Nazi problem since a decade or two), but the Balkans are still fucked even thirty years after all the wars.

What I don't know for sure: what did the world and Germany do different that it worked out? My only explanation is that there was one thing associated with "healing" - that perpetrators of violence and injustice /got brought to justice/. Jail times, asset confiscations, death penalty for the really serious high level Nazis, and that /fast/ - where the Balkan ICTY trials are /still ongoing/, after all these years.
