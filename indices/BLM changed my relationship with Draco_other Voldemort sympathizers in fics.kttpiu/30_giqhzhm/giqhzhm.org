i get it. i have always had a hard issue with death eater fics because i have always equated them to nazis. fics where harry testifies for lucius and draco get me so freaking angry because they always get off with no punishment. death eaters like lucius should be given life with our parole no matter what. it's obvious lucius did not learn from the first war when he was young and joined. that's why i have an issue with draco redemptions too, i feel bad for him but the fact is draco committed crimes. he almost murdered two classmates. both would have died if they weren't lucky. it doesn't matter how afraid he was he still did it. i feel like he should have went to azkaban for a few years but definitely not life.
