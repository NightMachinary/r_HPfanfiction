  However, if you have something to say about Draco and his redemption arc in fanfiction, I would love to hear it.

I rarely, if ever, see any real 'redemption' in those kind of fics. It's always more along of the lines of "let bygones be bygones" and "it was a crazy time with death eaters, a dark lord and my parents made me do it anyway". It's all very superficial and the desire of the *author* to move on from that and get to *their* story shines through.

IMHO it's a very profound question that you ask: How can someone like Draco be redeemed?

I don't have a step by step answer for that, but I think it's very hard to do it if you work from 100% canon of the 7 years in the books. There's so much water under the bridge, and so many (missed) opportunities for Draco to take a different approach. He's not going to be redeemed by being nice to Hermione in the Ministry and feeling sorry about himself. You'd need way better writing than that.

What makes it worse is another thing that you mentioned: This idea of immediate acceptance after showing the first sign of regret. Apologizing after losing the civil war (which involved torture of inncoents and planned genocide) is like apologizing for getting caught. Of course they are going to apologize and try to play nice at that point, even non-Slytherins would. How could anyone tell if they are genuine?

Personally I found the idea that someone like Hermione or Harry has the moral obligation to give someone like Draco "a chance" after the canonical ending absolutely laughable. Actually it's the opposite: They have the obligation to be witnesses, give public account of his crimes and not let him get away with it by giving everyone puppy dog eyes. The idea that Harry should put in a "good word" for the Malfoys and downplay their numerous crimes is morally abhorrent to me.

Redemption during the war is more interesting: It makes a lot of sense to be wary of Slytherins, because they could be spies or planning betrayal. On the other hand, refusing to use these resources, because you hold a grudge at them is stupid (and a Harry who refuses them just because he's stubborn makes me incredibly mad). In any case: If their motivations are genuine the redemption is almost a given in those scenarios, because they actually risk something and have to endure hardships.
