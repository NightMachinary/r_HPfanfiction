There's the question of at what point people should be considered responsible for their own actions. There isn't a straightforward answer to this. If some toddler happens across daddy's gun and shoots someone, obviously the toddler is not the one at fault. But what about 11-year-old Draco being a racist? He never really had an opportunity to learn anything better. 17-year-old Draco obviously had qualms, but he was in too deep to see a way out at that point. He wasn't reveling in evil like Greyback and Bellatrix.

Now consider Lucius. We don't know the details of how he joined Voldemort, but we know that at one point he was an ignorant 11-year-old racist just like Draco. We like to think that we're inherently better than these villains, that if we were in that situation we'd do the right thing, but in practice most of us just follow in our families' footsteps without thinking too hard about it. I don't like this tendency to sort people into villains over there and good guys over here, because once we start thinking of ourselves as the good guys, we're less likely to question our own actions. We just assume that whatever we're doing must be right because we're the good guys.
