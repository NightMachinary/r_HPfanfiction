I agree that the point a person becomes responsible for their actions can be contested, and that the consequences of an action may depend on the context of said action and events leading up to it. This is a heavily nuanced idea that is very relevant, but I fear it can easily be used as a way to pardon horrific acts (outside of HP, just look toward arguments made in defense of school shooters). I personally do not believe we are given enough details from canon to dissect Lucius, Bellatrix, Greyback, etc. and determine their own possibility for redemption, and nor do I particularly wish to do so. I think comparing them to Draco & friends is going to result in some pretty big assumptions. And like I said before, fuck adult Death Eaters.

Draco was in fact indoctrinated from a young age, pressured into a cult, and protected Harry from discovery in Malfoy Manor, but he /did/ take the Mark, attempt murder MULTIPLE times, and ultimately subscribed to racist ideas that played out as violent acts until the conclusion of the war. These should all be taken into account in creating a redemption arc! My problem is when an author glosses over it in an effort to get to romance, that's all.

And lastly, I do not believe war is a case of good vs. evil, but *let's be verryy cautious of our rhetoric when discussing the sides of a race war.* I hope you understand why /I/ am not interested at all in debating the morality of racism, only what we do following its effects for those who wish to be forgiven.
