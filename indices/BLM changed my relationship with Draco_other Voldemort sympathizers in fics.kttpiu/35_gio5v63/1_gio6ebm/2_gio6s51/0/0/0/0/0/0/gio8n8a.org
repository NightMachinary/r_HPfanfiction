I've read stuff like that already. So are you claiming that since you're one of the good guys, you've never purchased anything made by enslaved people? Ever?

And in response to your last paragraph you added latter: It might be a better use of your time to figure out how to stop financially supporting slavery, instead of spending your time boasting that sure, you might financially support slavery, but at least you're not racist like those villains over there.
