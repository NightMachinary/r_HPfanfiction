It's hard for people to follow this argument when you keep editing your comments to try to hide your mistakes.

I'm saying there are plenty of racists who wouldn't be caught dead using the n-word. They'll proudly proclaim that they're not racist, just like you're doing. They'll eagerly point to other people, calling them racist, to avoid having to discuss which of their own actions contribute to racism. Many of these polite racists do more harm than the blatantly obvious racists.
