Saying the n-word or the m-word is bad. But I see an awful lot of people who seem to think that as long as they refrain from saying the n-word, they're not racists. An awful lot of polite racists are eager to put all the blame for racism on the few people who are openly racist, the ones who shout the n-word in public. They're not willing to examine their own participation in racism. I'm not saying that people who shout the n-word are good. I'm saying that people who refrain from saying the n-word aren't necessarily better.

And you said earlier that the only people who say that race is a social construct are “white people who just want to pretend that white privilege doesn't exist.” You're the one who argued yourself into a corner by claiming that anyone who says race is a social construct, such as Ta-Nehisi Coates, is white. You're really making it apparent than you've read only white people's writings about this.
