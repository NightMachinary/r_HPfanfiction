“Race is a social construct” doesn't mean we should disregard race. It's just as real as other social constructs like money and religion.

I don't see the relevance of the topic in this discussion anyway. HalfBloodPrinplup only brought it up because I made a comment about it ages ago in a different discussion, and HalfBloodPrinplup apparently believes that me quoting Ta-Nehisi Coates on this subject makes me a racist, so everything else I say should be disregarded.
