I honestly don't think this is a great comparison, for myself. If you look at the history of the wizarding world in a vacuum, sure, but if you look at it more widely, I struggle. If you look at the history in combination with the real-world history of the witch hunts, and sources that say a lot of people died -- including in further sources from the HP world.

If you're talking about purebloods who grew up with this knowledge, where the entire year of a generation in four countries can fit in four dorms of ten people, and the majority of their population was wiped out, that's terrifying.

In real world comparisons, the Jews. The majority of our population was wiped out in WWII, some entire towns were lost. Multiple dialects were lost. We will likely never recover our numbers. The hate I've gotten for being half in my own community is severe. Jews who marry out have parents who worry about their children keeping the culture.

In the wizarding world, this ends up going to an extreme, where new blood is seen with fear and hesitance, leading to the blood purity issues. So you have a society persecuted against, then societally persecuting the people who come in from the society that persecuted them, and reacting against it. When you have Hogwarts teaching that "Witch Burnings didn't work and here's why,' when most were killed by hanging, while at the same time saying that the very great majority couldn't cast wandlessly, in a school with so many abandoned classrooms, and the two House ghosts who were killed by Muggles for witchcraft (Nick and the Friar) that begins to sound like propaganda.

Are the blood purity wars right? No, it is absolutely racism. It is racism /caused/ by racism. No one's right, but when you grow up on stories about how the Founders founded Hogwarts in the first place to protect the children, or hear stories about X relatives who were hung by muggles, this will lead to the kind of defense that's there, especially with how long-lived wizards are. Dippet, the headmaster before Dumbledore was born in 1632 and died in 1992. They then acted out toward the people coming from that society.

I think it's a struggle as to how people heal, but I think it will depend on how the writer is taking the muggleborns and half-bloods who were hurt and injured. Are they going to turn on the purebloods or not? Can they come to a satisfactory agreement? Or is the wizarding world doomed to a cycle of this? Discrimination against muggleborns leads to discrimination on purebloods, leads to discrimination against muggleborns...and on and on.

I honestly don't know, I don't have a good answer.
