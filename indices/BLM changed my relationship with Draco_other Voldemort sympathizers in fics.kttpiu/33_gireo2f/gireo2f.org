  those who attempt to change should have an avenue to do so. This is also not about adult Death Eaters. Fuck them. I'm talking about supporters who were classmates to the Golden Trio (Blaise, Pansy, Daphne, Theo, Draco, etc).

Is there canonical evidence that Blaise Zabini, Daphne Greengrass, or Theodore Nott were death eater supporters? Or are you just saying that "all Slytherins are death eaters/supporter"? Which, somewhat ironically is the exact sort of arguement a racist would make.
