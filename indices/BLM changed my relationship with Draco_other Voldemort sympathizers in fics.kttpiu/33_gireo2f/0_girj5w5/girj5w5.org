I do not think there is evidence any of these three were Marked. There is canonical evidence of Blaise and Theo being bigoted toward Muggleborns and those who advocate for them. Blaise's disdain towards Ginny Weasley when asked if he found her attractive (calling her a "filthy blood-traitor") is enough evidence for me to assert that he was not sympathetic towards Muggleborns, which, while not meaning he supported Voldemort, can mean he was definitely not on the Light side of the war. Nott's father was an infamous Death Eater, and I believe he was seen laughing about Hermione's blood status a handful of times in the series. Not sure if he was ever Marked, but I believe it is safe to assume he was not on the Light side of the war. There is limited information on Daphne across canon, and because she's kinda become an unofficial OC in the past few years, I was going off what I've read in fics of her being either Neutral or leaning towards Dark.
