I wonder what effect that could have of the Dursleys. Just imagining the Tantrum Dudley would pull if his sister tried to make him play with dolls or barbies, but she could always have Harry to play with, would Petunia and Vernon really say no to him playing with her if she tells them that she wants him to? I think Dudley as is in canon would hate to do anything that would be seen as girly, with both Vernon and Marge telling him how he's supposed to grow up and be a good strong man like his dad, and not a sissy or a 'nancy boy'.\\
Of course that opens up other cans of worms, if she does have Harry as a playmate and they like each other, would she realise that hey, maybe cousins shouldn't live in cupboards under the stairs? It's interesting since Dudley's been raised to be just like his dad, and encouraged to look down on Harry, while I think they'd want a daughter to be a little lady, proper, and normal, and not to get into fights, and to wear dresses and be pretty.

It's an interesting thought experiment, keep us posted on how your story writing goes?
