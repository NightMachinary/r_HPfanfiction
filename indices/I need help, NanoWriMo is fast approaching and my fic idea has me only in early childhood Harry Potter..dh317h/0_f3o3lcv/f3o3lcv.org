It depends on what you want to do with the sister. Generally speaking, it would probably be easier to replace Dudley with a girl born around 1981, so she would be younger than Harry and, in her childish innocence, might develop a sisterly attachment to Harry, even against the wishes of the Dursleys.

The Dursleys would probably be the biggest obstacle as they were horribly abusive. Which honestly I would keep that way. Because that gives you a lot of possibilities for cute scenes where Harry and his little cousin work together to defy Vernon and Petunia. Harry helping her to learn stuff, her sneaking him food, maybe Harry later returning the favour with magical candy.

Dudley existing would be a roadblock because he could easily prevent all of that from happening. Which is why I would write him out and replace him with the little girl.

An interesting arc would be the girl turning out to be a witch.

And keep in mind that a Harry who took the protector role for his cousin would most likely end up in Hufflepuff.
