  Do you guys ever imagine AUs of fanfics?

All the bloody time. All though mostly AU's where characters from different fanfic AU's end up there, lol.

I'd love to see any of the Hogwarts Battle School characters get transported to a not-as-dark-AU like Magical Relations or the Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles.

Or have BlackInkRedRose!Ginny plus that AU's trio end up in The First Day or one of those AU's where Harry and Ginny have a soul bond.

I'd also love to have a Wizard!Dudley (like the one from Dudley Dursley and the Sorcerer's stone) ending up in a place where Harry got really messed up from the Dursleys like the universe of the Art of Self-Fashioning.
