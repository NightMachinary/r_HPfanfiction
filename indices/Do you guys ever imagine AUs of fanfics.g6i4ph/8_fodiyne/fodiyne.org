I've never thought about them being AU's exactly, but sometimes there are stories with brilliant premises that are tainted by poor writing, bashing, or other issues. Sometimes I persevere through the bad to enjoy the good, and sometimes I just end up stopping. Either way I have often imagined editing/rewriting a fic without those bad parts. Especially when the incidents of bad writing are clearly removed from the plot enough that it feels like it would take only an hour to snip out the bad and clean up the stitching to improve a fic by a ton.
