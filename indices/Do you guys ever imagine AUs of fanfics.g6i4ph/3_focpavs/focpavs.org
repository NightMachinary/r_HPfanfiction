All the goddamn time. I've been toying with an AU of HPMOR, focused primarily on a Harry trying to apply the scientific method to magic rather than 'use science' to investigate matters. As little jargon as I can get away with.

Harry would be this supergenius who's already completed his first year of undergrad chemistry by the time the Hogwarts letter arrives. Has issues connecting with people, which is naturally why he's sorted to Hufflepuff.

I've been chipping away at getting the theory of magic down before I start writing, because this isn't something I can do without planning :p
