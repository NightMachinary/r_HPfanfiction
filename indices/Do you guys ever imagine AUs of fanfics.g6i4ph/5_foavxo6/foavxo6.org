I detest bad endings. Sometimes, if I encounter a fic with one, I tend to think "nah this isn't how the fic ends, THIS is how the fic ends" and imagine my own end instead. If the ending isn't open-ended enough, I'm not able to "fix" things and just get sad instead. A similar thing happens in fics that end "haha everything up to this point didn't matter", I typically retaliate in my own head as "haha the ending didn't happen", because while those kind of endings doesn't make me /sad/, they just annoy me.

What makes this especially aggravating is that the ship I like the most has a lot of bad endings (not as in "more than 50%" but definitely more than most). To the point where I typically start reading fics with this ship by reading the last chapter first to see if it ends badly so I can stop before I get invested.
