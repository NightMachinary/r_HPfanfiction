Yes. I have frequently thought about how I would have continued Out of the Night by Raining Ink, or done things differently. It's one of my favourite fanfics, but I always had a problem with one aspect of the world building, namely that Dark magic was so powerful compared to normal magic that it made no sense that Dark wizards were an oppressed minority.

If I'd written an AU of it, or continued it, I would have wanted to rebalance things to show Dark magic as different but not /a priori/ better/more powerful.

The themes and arcs were so solidly set up that a satisfying continuation practically writes itself. As the fic stood at the time of abandonment, Harry is split between two identities. His character arc of having to reconcile his two natures and thereby establish a new path is very inviting. I'm not sure if that's how Raining Ink planned to do things - he was quite enamoured with Dark magic, so it might be that he planned to lean hard into that and have Harry side entirely with the Dark community - but personally I find the theme of moderation and reconciliation more interesting than picking your side and achieving victory for it.
