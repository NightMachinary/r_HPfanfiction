I think most people have. There are a lot of fanfictions that start off with a very solid premise, and gets people hooked - and then as it goes along, and the possibilities narrow to what the author had in mind, it can obviously strike readers as less fun than what they might have dreamt up.

So I think it's only natural to find an idea that inspired you, and think of how it could have been different. It's no different than how fanfiction is derived from the canon series, after all.
