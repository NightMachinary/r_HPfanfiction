Hmm.. Well, I'm a big fan of time travel/AU travel ones, so any that have a good premise for that have probably caught my interest as such. For instance, the myriad "Harry goes back to ____ time" is rife with possibilities, and even the best interpretation of it still leaves a lot of other ones.

I think some of the other ones are those like 'Harry Crow' or 'the Runestone Path' or 'Dodging Prison and Stealing Wenches' - where my problem is more with poor writing or overpowered Harry that makes it hard/impossible for me to read them, but the actual ideas for each of them are quite interesting.
