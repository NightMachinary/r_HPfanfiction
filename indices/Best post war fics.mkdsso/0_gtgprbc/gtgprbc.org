Everything by Northumbrian. You have the chronological list on FanFiction.Net on his profile. And you also have some snipppets of stories that might have happened during the books and are canon compliant ;) my major head cannons on the post war are his. If you want directly after the war, you can start with Tales of the Battle or Grave Days.
