There's a two-part series that has Harry turning against the goblins after they turn against him: /A Brand New Start/, and /This Time the Potters/, by FairyWm.

The world has turned on Harry in the post-war world--painting him as a budding dark lord, etc. Gringotts is taking an exorbitant portion of his fortune to pay for the damage and the dragon. In a fit of temper, after first demanding a blood test to see which vaults he qualifies for, Harry declares he's withdrawing everything that's his from Gringotts and never coming back. (The method he uses to transport all this treasure is a semi-humorous thing that carries on through the book.) He then proceeds to reshape the wizarding world at least three times--present, past, and, well, spoilers.

I enjoyed it a lot. The second book is still in progress (says hiatus on FF, but the author is over on AO3 now (as Faewm) saying they're going to try posting again).
