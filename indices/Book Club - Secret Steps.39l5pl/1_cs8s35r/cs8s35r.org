I think this story was pretty good, but not one of my favorites. It was paced well, the plot was interesting enough, and there were no obvious flaws.

I especially liked the AU and I think the author did a really good job at worldbuilding. However, I felt that the story was too short to do the world justice. Like, this AU started off with so much potential, and then the story just never tapped into most of that potential. If this story was twice as long, or I could read a side story set in the same world, I would probably do so, because there are just so many questions to explore in this new setting.

But as it is, I feel like this story is only deserving of a good review, not a great one.
