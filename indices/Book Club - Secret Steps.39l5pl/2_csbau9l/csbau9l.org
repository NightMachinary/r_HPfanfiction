I thought it was an interesting premise, and the AU was really intriguing... But I should insert the disclaimer that I didn't manage to make it past the 3rd chapter.

This seemed like such a quiet, dull fic. I was /bored/ with a Hermione this young. I found it really difficult to immerse in the initial chapters where Hermione is such a child. To me, it felt like the fic drug its feet excessively in setting up the plot. I don't like or have kids, so presumably that caused my inability to relate to this fic. I also wasn't super impressed with the characterization of Severus. His voice and character (in the beginning chapters I read, at least) felt unremarkable and weren't memorable; to me, this was a weak way to start out the story.

I ended up skipping to the last chapter just briefly to see how old Hermione ends up being; I was worried that if I attempted to invest in this fic and the pace stayed the same, it'd be the same slow, boring drag until the story ended with Hermione finishing her first year... Since she actually ends up a near-adult, presumably the fic picks up it's pace at some point?

I'd be willing to give this a second shot if someone can convince me that chapter 4 is where it really gets good. d:
