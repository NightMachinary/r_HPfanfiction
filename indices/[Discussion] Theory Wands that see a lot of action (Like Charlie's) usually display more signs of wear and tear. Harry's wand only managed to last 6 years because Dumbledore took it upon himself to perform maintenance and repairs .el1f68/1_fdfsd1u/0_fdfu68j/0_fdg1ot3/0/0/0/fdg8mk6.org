I just found it again to see just how bad it was. I was planning on commenting some quotes, but there is just too much. In chapter 5, the day after meeting Harry for the first time, Hermiones dad explains in detail that he and his wife roleplay in the bedroom, invving costumes, chains, wax, leather that Hermione has walked in on her mom in a maid's dress bent over a table when she was younger, that hermione stole her moms dime novels at age 8 and asked what throbbing manliness meant, and more. All in the space of about 14 paragraphs.

All of this because apparently the life debt owed by Hermione for Harry saving her life at 11 combined with her guilt in hurting Harry by destroying the Horcrux in his head means that she is magically compelled to "make things up to Harry" and that she needs to be "punished" satisfy magic. Lupin and Tonks figure this out, explain it to the Grangers, and the Grangers approach a fifteen year old boy they hardly know and ask him to dominate their daughter in bed.
