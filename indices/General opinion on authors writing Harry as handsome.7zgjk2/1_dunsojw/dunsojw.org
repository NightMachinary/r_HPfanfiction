It doesn't bother me and it plays into the perception we all probably hold that the hero is very good looking, which is quite common across all forms of fiction.

If you're doing an AU where Harry meets a very attractive character for the first time and they get together quickly and/or the story deals with a lot of will they/won't they conflict, it makes sense for Harry to be attractive himself. Not required, but logical.
