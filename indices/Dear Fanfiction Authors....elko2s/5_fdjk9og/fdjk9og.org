Brit here. I mean, on a slightly less... rage-inducing level I totally agree with you. It is a little irritating when you see English people blatantly doing American (and often Christian-American) things with no acknowledgement of UK Culture, but it is really hard for people to pick up on the differences or even that there are differences at all. There's a kind of implicit assumption that Britain and America are basically the same except the latter has guns and dollars while the former has knives and pounds - that whole 'special relationship' bollocks. If you have that assumption, you're not going to bother googling because you think you know the answer already. They'll plow ahead until they come up against something telling them that they're wrong, upon which they'll either double-down in stubbornness or correct themselves. Not everyone has the time to learn an entirely new culture for their fandom (looking at you, Weaboos) so they're going to make it as easy for themselves to write as they can. Write what you know and all that.

The Sherbet Lemon thing is a Philosophers-Sorcerers stone issue. Apparently the American prints have the Lemon Drop while we have the Sherbet Lemon, so if they're literally reading it in the book they're going to make that same culturally-synonymous assumption.

And even at the big level, sometimes we're very unfamiliar to most - the difference between England, Britain, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom being most obvious to us, but other cultures often use them as synonyms without really being aware that there's specific differences in the same way that I'm sure most of us from the UK couldn't name all the states and associated US territories.

Using Dollars is rather lazy, I'll give you that, but at that point you've got to start blaming the US Public School system rather than the American themselves. If they're not taught that the world is more than just 'America, land of hope and freedom!' and 'Not-America, land of sadness and tyranny!', then that's what we'll end up with. Heh. Fix the school system so we get better fanfic might actually work. There certainly are enough Potterheads to get a decent voting influence. :)
