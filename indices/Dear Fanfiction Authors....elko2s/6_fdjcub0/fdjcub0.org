It's not always that easy. Most of the time I put in an Americanism it's because I didn't know there was a different term or phrase in British English. Over time an American author will have a growing knowledge base of British words and even develop an eye for picking out words that "sound" American. Having a britpicker go edit your chapters is ideal, but that's not always possible. I try to give writers some slack in this area just because I know how hard it is.

Then there's the stories that are particularly egregious and obviously not trying at all to sound British at all. Sometimes this is a design choice. It's actually a pretty big overhead trying to make dialogue (or even narration, sometimes) sound British, and I can understand the decision to not even try. Of course that comes down to preference, obviously some people will find this unreadable, and that's fair.

Sometimes authors are completely oblivious to the fact that there are differences between British and American English. I generally assume these are either teens or writing novices. The writing quality of these fics are usually bad enough that style is the least of their problems, and certainly not the first thing one should focus on when trying to improve.

I get your frustration, but I also see the other side of it.
