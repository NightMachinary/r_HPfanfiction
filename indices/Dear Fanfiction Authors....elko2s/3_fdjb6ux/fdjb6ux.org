Tbf, this one is also a brand name vs generic thing.

I agree with your points as a whole though (britpicking is a hobby of mine at this point). I was reading a fic once and the Weasleys suddenly started celebrating thanksgiving. The author didn't realise how wrong that was until a few chapters in? I stopped reading it instantly. I also hate American slang in HP fics.

Nothing can beat Americans not knowing how to use wotcher probably though.
