Why a muggle specifically. Also it seems like seeing it through just about anything works, the issue is more that noone knew it was a basilisk.

There's also the fact that it doesn't actually save you if Riddle actually wants you dead, he wasn't actually trying to kill people in the books (that would close the school down). If he wanted you dead then there's the venom, fangs and massive body to kill you with.
