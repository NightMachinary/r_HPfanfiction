This is a pretty bad idea for two major reasons:

1. It doesn't matter if the Basilisk sees you. The problem is you seeing the basilisk. You could flip the mirror so that you're only seeing yourself but, really, if you goal is to just blind yourself to your immediate forward-facing path, a one-way mirror seems excessive.

2. Petrification was a good thing, in practice. Say your idea works, and the student notices the giant snake but it can't petrify or “kill with a look” the student to death. What's the basilisks next move? “Aw, shucks, you're so clever! Guess I'll go bother someone else!” No. It'd kill them.
