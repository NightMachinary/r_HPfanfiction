In case you haven't read them already, linkffn(Basilisk-Born) and linkffn(A Long Journey Home) both have a large helping of History and deeper Magic by their very nature. The premise of both is that Harry (or in the case of ALJH Fem!Harry) gets sent back in time a /very/ long way. Stuck in the past, he (r she) learns magic as it used to be. Don't let the Fem!Harry element put you off - it works fine in that particular story.
