I'll have a think and get back to you. I'm currently reading linkffn(When A Veela Cries) which has some really interesting bits on magic usage, and cultural history, but less focus on deep theory. By this I mean there is a strong focus on combat magic, and I think this writer really has the hang of writing magical fight scenes. I don't think it's /quite/ what you're looking for, but it's at least partially relevant. Will have a hunt through my Favourites now.
