The departure fireplace has to be lit, but the arrival fireplace needn't be. That allows the Weasleys to get to Privet Drive in canon. It does seem like a security risk, so I have them be lockable in my story. You can set your fireplace to accept calls only, or be totally closed. I have a switch on the side of the fireplace with three settings, and also remote switches you can carry with you to enable you to open your home Floo remotely. I admit that this seems too logical for the wizarding world, but it was all I could think of.
