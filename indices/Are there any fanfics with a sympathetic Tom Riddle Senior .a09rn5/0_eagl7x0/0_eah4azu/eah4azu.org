It's beyond rape, even. A million times worse than rape.

He was drugged into loving and starting a life with someone. Dreams of children, growing old, and grandchildren.

Then one day he wakes up - it's all fake. All of it is fake. He doesn't believe it, anymore. His love is a witch. A detestable, rapist of a woman.

He runs.

He gets home.

Magic isn't real, obviously. No one believes him. He's the guy who knocked up “that girl” and then ran away when he got cold feet.

Her mistake is forever in his mind.

Then, one day, a decade and a half later, a reminder of her evilness shows up at the fucking door.

“Rape” is much too kind of a word.
