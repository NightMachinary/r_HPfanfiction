*Fate's Gamble* - linkffn(9586702)

Mixup of HP and the Fate Series. Harry learns from both and mixes and matches them, making things even more overpoweringly broken.

I'm about halfway through. It's got some action, magic exploration, trolly goodness (his grandpa is the trollmaster), and a bunch of other stuff.
