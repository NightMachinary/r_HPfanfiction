I'm almost done reading it myself. I only have a passing knowledge of the Fate Series/Nasuverse, and it explains things really well.

The main thing to know is that magi have a different mindset than wizards/witches and humans. They are more... Sociopathic. They will do anything to advance their craft, as long as it doesn't burst their secrecy.

It is a non-human Harry story though. It's really interesting though.
