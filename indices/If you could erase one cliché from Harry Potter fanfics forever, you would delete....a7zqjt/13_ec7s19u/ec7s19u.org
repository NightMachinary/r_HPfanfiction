Aside from the ones already mentioned in this thread, I'd get rid of wizards saying 'Merlin' as an exclamation instead of God/Lord/etc. It's very minor, but it's a pet peeve of mine that fanon somehow made this universal, despite it not occurring in the original books at all--even pureblood bigot Lucius Malfoy says 'Good Lord' at one point.
