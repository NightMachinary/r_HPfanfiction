What's more I'll add is the secrecy thing didn't become law until the late 1600s. Christianity was pretty much standard for Europe and you are even looking at a post protestant revolution world.

So unless you are arguing that in an attempt to distance themselves from the world they are hiding from wizards revived ancient half forgotten pagan traditions it makes sense for them to be Christian's towards atheism/spiritualism than anything
