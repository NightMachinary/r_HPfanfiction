Right, and maybe I didn't communicate it properly but that is what I meant by my last bit. They use christian expressions, or expressions that are common in the historically christian world even though they themselves aren't practitioners of the faith.

Though that does raise questions about magicals in the Far East, the Islamic World, Subsaharan Africa, and the Americas. What expressions might they use, and for that matter what are their opinions towards the Statute of secrecy? Did all the world really agree to it, or was there a period of/Ongoing magical colonialism to enforce it across the globe?
