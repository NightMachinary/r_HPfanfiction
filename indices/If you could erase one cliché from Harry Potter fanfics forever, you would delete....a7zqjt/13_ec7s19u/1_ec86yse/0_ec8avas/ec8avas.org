My only argument against this is that nothing of Christianity is shown in the books other than Christmas and the "oh god/lord" expressions, all of which could be written off as a culture thing rather than a religious one. I'm an atheist and I have atheist friends who all celebrate either Christmas/the Solcist, and we say "oh my god," because that's a holiday and an expression of the culture we were brought up in.
