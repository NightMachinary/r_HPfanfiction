| Yeah, sometimes I am curious exactly why JKR chose for Ron to turn his back on the trio

Ron struggles with jealousy and feelings of inadequacy. In addition, his temper leads him to act without thinking. Seeing Harry get chosen for something Ron thinks would set him apart from his family sets off his temper, so you can see why he initially would blow up at Harry. (You know, besides being fucking 14, since this community has such a hardon against teens acting like teenagers. See any discussion with Cadmean Victory in it) After the initial blow up, he probably struggled with embarrassment about how he acted, and double downed on his behavior. It's hard for adults to admit when they are wrong, so you can imagine it would be hard for Ron.

Hermione would give Harry the benefit of the doubt. She tends to believe the best in people, until they prove otherwise.

I do think a Hermione betrayal would be cool to read, if written without her saying it's because he broke the rules that she follows religiously (Because brewing a high level potion and illegally imitating other students is the behavior of a rules stickler, m-i-rite?) or because she's in love with Ron (these fics are normally heavy on the bashing so...). Hermione is very vicious in canon, and I wonder how her betrayal would have played out.
