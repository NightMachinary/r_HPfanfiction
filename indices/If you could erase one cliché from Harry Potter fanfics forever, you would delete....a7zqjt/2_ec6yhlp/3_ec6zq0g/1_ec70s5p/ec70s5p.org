Nuh uh, nowadays the women fight and the men are only there to highlight how cool the women are.

Except when the opposite happens, I guess.

I think the only proper problems in media are the frequent use of "Smart character equals asshole or god who predicts the impossible" and "She's so magic it devalues our magic system".
