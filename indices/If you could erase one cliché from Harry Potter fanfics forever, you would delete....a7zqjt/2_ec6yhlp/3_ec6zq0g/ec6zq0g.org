Boy would that cause a shitstorm nowadays. Men are the fighters, the ones who save the day/world, the girls wait at home.

And before anyone points out that this is exaggerated, the developers of Kingdom Come Deliverance got a lot of flak for refusing to include characters of colour in a 15th-century Bohemian setting. Personally, I don't care one bit about diversity over history/realistic accuracy, but such is the state of media nowadays.
