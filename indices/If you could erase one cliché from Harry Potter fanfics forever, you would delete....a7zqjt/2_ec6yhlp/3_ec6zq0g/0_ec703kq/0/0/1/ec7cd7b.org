*Call-out culture*

Call-out culture (also known as outrage culture) is a term for the social phenomenon of publicly denouncing perceived racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and other forms of bigotry. Denunciation ("call-outs") can happen in person or online.Some commentators contend that callout culture is a pernicious influence in both the academic and business worlds, citing the controversy at Google over a memorandum concerning the respective vocational interests of men and women, authored by former Google engineer James Damore. Other commentators have argued that callout culture can harm progressive politics by attacking people perceived to have exhibited prejudiced behaviour, rather than using dialogue with such people to change such behaviour. A 2013 essay, "Exiting the Vampire Castle", by Mark Fisher, is often cited as an early critique of call-out culture.
