No, the article has almost no substance and the writing is subpar. But there are apparently enough people reading the site so they stay afloat.

And my opinion of the current western feminists is pretty low because the "mainstream" ignores the problems we have in this world (be it female babies being killed, the misogynistic attitude of the Islamic world or the lack of equal rights in many parts of the world) and instead focus on manspreading or gender-neutral language. Because taking up a little more space is clearly worse than treating women like property or stoning them for having a sexuality.
