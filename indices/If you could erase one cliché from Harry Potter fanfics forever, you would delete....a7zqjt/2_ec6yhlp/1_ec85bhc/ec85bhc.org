Both arguments are very misunderstood in the fandom, and usually informed by the film versions.

The films in general took every opportunity to bastardize, slander and bash Ron, creating a fanon interpretation that is sustained via fanfiction. In Deathly Hallows part 2 the film makers very un-subtly created romantic tension between Harry and Hermione (which was clearly not present in the books), creating a tidal wave of anti-Ron sentiment from Harry/Hermione shippers.

Only quite recently has Ron bashing become less popular, and fanfics with Ron as a main character are becoming more popular.

I just don't see how a fandom can be so bloody defensive of Malfoy, but bash someone like Ron.
