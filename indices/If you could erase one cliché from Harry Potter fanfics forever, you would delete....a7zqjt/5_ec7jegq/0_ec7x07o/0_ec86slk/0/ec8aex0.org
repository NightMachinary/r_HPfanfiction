  Or the quill lobby is strong and the OWL and NEWT testers require you to use the anti-cheat quills so quills are used in school so you can be ready to use them on the tests

Makes sense. Like how people have to use standard No. 2 pencils.

I remember reading a fanon explaination that quills work a lot better with parchment than pens and pencils, and that the parchment is enchanted (supported by post owls being able to sense who to bring their letter to), so they needed to use parchment. The actual explaination was better than my butchered summary but you get the jist.
