I like the view that linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) takes on this.

Things that were once living have a greater presence in magic, along with metal and stone taken from the earth. They are easier to enchant and hold magic far longer.

Harry is physically blind but can see magic. Wood, metal, natural fibers, parchment, quills are bright with the colors of magic while concrete, plastics and other synthetics, are dark shadows. Wizards prefer the former over the latter.
