Slytherins being actually cunning, Machiavellian politicians at age 11.

I get the desire to depict it as more than the shithole it was in canon, but you have to remember that the pureblood bigots end up there due to tradition and disqualification in the other houses (genocide is not chivalrous, attacking Muggles is not fair play, believing in pureblood supremacy is not a sign of intelligence). The likes of Malfoy, Lestrange, Flint and Crabbe/Goyle have to go somewhere and they fit nowhere else. So obviously they would drag the standard down considerably (and beat up anyone acting like the average fanfic Slytherin).

Perhaps the better way would be to have a lot of fractions in Slytherin with lots of (sometimes quite violent) infighting, with the wannabe Death Eaters ruling the lot with mob-tactics.
