Oh, I mostly just meant the cliche that has all of Harry's problems miraculously fixed by going to Gringotts. Whether it's being emancipated, sticking it to Dumbledore/the Ministry/Voldemort (whoever), or getting a pesky Horcrux removed, the "Helpful Goblins" have all the answers (even though they're, you know, just a bank). Although they hate wizards, they find something truly special about Harry, and therefore will go to great lengths to help him.

Often in these stories we have Harry magically able to either say the correct English phrase to get them to think he's just super awesome or he even has memorized Goblin language etiquette books that dictate just what to say on such an occasion. It's usually something that's trying way too hard to sound commanding and adult but just comes off as juvenile.

Most often, Helpful Goblins are in Indie!Harry, Marriage Law!Harry and, of course, Lord Potter Black Peverall Slytherin Gryffindor Etcetera!Harry stories.
