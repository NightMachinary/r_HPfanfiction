I don't think it's the one I find the most objectionable, but the one that comes to mind right now is the "House Elves need to be bound to a wizard family in order to survive" trope.

"But, 'Mione, House Elves need wizard magic, they'll die if they're free." Explained Harry

Hermione had a skeptical look on her face as she asked "Are you sure? I've never read anything about that."

"Of course I'm sure 'Moine, trust me, I studied all summer, except for the time that I spent shopping for a new trunk, and new clothes, and a custom wand, and all the time I spent writing letters to my new Slytherin friends, and inheriting my lordships, oh and dealing with my marriage contracts and my parents will and all that Independent Harry (TM) stuff. But other than all that I studied all summer, so I'd know better."

"Oh, okay, well if you're sure, I guess I'll just stop caring about House Elves and never mention it for the rest of the fic, I sure am glad I have such a smart and wise friend, such as you."
