Exactly. I didn't always hate Snape, but as I grew up I realized just how petty and disgusting the character really was. Now, I don't even glance at fanfics that have him listed as a main character.

Unless the story has him redeeming himself before telling Voldemort the prophecy, or him not being obsessed with Lily because Snape/Lily pairing is the worst ship since the genesis of fanfiction.
