Characters almost INSTANTANEOUSLY becoming badass or intelligent or competent or something else like that. It's stupid to assume that you could learn all the intricacies of magic and be at a level where you could compete with adults in an insanely short time. The number of fics I've seen where Harry decides suddenly without that he will be better and then they time skip and he's suddenly a badass. I know that it's relevent to the plot and all but it would take only a little more effort to write a premise where he worked hard from the day he got his books all the way until the point where you're writing your story.

Essentially my biggest problems with fanfiction in general is the common lack of character progression or lack of flaws entirely. I get that you want to write your favourite characters to be the utter Gods you want them to be but they can't start off that way and they can't be utterly flawless. It may be fun to fantasize about but when you're reading the story out just makes it so hard to read ahead because you know that there isn't any real risk and all the conflicts will be resolved easily.
