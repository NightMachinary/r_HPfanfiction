Closest I can think of is linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation by Vera Rozalsky). It's a postwar fic with Hermione taking some daring choices in order to sort out her war-battered brain. She's attracted to men more than women, but there are some saucy parts where she grieves over (and tries to re-enact) some missed chances with Tonks.

Eh... maybe not so close.

There's also the quintessential Hermione/Luna fic linkffn(Crazy Little Things by dreiser). Also post-war, Luna has to draw Hermione out of her traditionalist shell in several ways.
