By the technical "all your grandparents are wizards" definition I suppose they are still technically pure-blood.

But we should remember that for the group of people who really care about blood status, the technical definition doesn't really matter much. The Weasleys are pure-blood but because they don't support the ideology, they are considered blood-traitors and thus of equally low status. Meanwhile many supposedly "pure" families in fact have various connections to Muggles in their family trees, but they all perform a lot of editing to pretend that they're completely pure.

So I doubt a pureblood born of two squibs would be welcomed by those who value blood status, regardless of what they technically count as -- unless, of course, they disown their squib parents and embrace the ideology, in which case they will be welcomed with open arms.
