JK actually cleared the cousin thing up, they weren't ashamed of him, they had had a falling out with him that was apparently fairly nasty. Ron wasn't saying "we don't want to be associated with accountants", he was saying "this is the closest link to knowing Muggles that I have, but it's closed".

His daughter Mafalda was apparently intended to be Hermione's Slytherin rival, with similar cleverness. It obviously never happened, alongside Hermione's sister.
