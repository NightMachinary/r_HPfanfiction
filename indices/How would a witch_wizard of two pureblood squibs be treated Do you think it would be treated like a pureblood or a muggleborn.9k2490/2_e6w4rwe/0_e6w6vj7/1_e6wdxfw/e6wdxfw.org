Linkffn(The Arithmancer) features Lily Moon (removed) and Sally-Anne Perks (maybe removed, maybe left in but unnamed) as two of Hermione's roommates. They feature heavily in the first two years and have a significant cameo in the fourth, but I think they were pretty much backhround dressing in year 3. I think WhiteSquirrel draws a lot from the removed details.
