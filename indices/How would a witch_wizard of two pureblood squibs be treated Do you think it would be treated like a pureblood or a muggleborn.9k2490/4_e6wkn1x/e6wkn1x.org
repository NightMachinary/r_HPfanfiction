Somewhere between a halfblood and a pureblood, although closer to a halfblood than a pureblood.

They'd be held in much greater regard than a mudblood, clearly, since they have only magical ancestry, and probably more than a halfblood, since their ancestry isn't tainted with muggles, but definitely less than purebloods, since neither of their parents can actually do anything magical.
