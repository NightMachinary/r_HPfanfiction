The thing about fighting scenes is that fighting (on paper at least) is really boring. It's repetitive, hard to visualize, and really ends up dragging on to the point that the reader just skims. Rather, the fight scene needs to serve the plot beyond a simple fight. Really that boils down to two things:

1. Reason
2. Consequence

If there's no reason for the fight to happen, then don't include it. Harry and Voldemort shooting some spells at each other because they haven't shot some spells at each other in a while doesn't move your plot forward. It just ups your word count. More interesting is if the fight exists to move the plot forward. Maybe your character is trying to break their best friend out of a prison, and there's a guard in the way. Or perhaps your character's friends are breaking into the Department of Mysteries, and the protagonist needs to distract the death eaters for a few minutes. Then the fight becomes important beyond the action. Without this, even a perfectly written fight is completely uninteresting.

The second part of a good fight is consequence. If after your awesome battle nothing's really changed, then what was the point? Why not just cut out the fight and move on with the fic? More interesting is when the fight changes something. A injured leg that gets in the way two chapters down the line. Or a friend dies and the rest of the characters have a hard time dealing with it. It's these types of things that make a fight impactful, not the arcane magic and massive battles (although that doesn't mean you shouldn't include those).

Once you've taken care of those two, you can move on to writing the action well. The first thing to note (which is true of all writing) is that a fight scene has to avoid getting too slow/boring. So, use very physical words. Smashed, swung, slashed, heaved. Keep it personal. Make the reader feel every blow and every curse. And make sure the emotions come through in your character's actions. A scrambling fighter is terrified. A man who's smashing a bottle is murderous. I don't want you to tell me the character's in pain. I want to feel the curse eviscerate his legs, and I want to feel him screaming under the Cruciatus. And if you can get across those emotions across to the reader, your fighting will be successful.
