  So, use very physical words. Smashed, swung, slashed, heaved. Keep it personal. Make the reader feel every blow and every curse.

I'll add to this since it appears to be implied though not said, when writing a scene centred on action, use those physical words in sentences that are simple, quick to read, short. To write action means to simulate the tempo of action, the experiences, and this means that whoever is narrating the story for the reader does not have time to reach for a thesaurus or form elaborate sentences, and thus the readers do not get a thesaurus trip nor elaborate word-flow. When a character screams from pain, don't write a whole sentence about it, tackle it onto a sentence that says what he's already doing a moment later because he does not have time to stop just because he screams and thus neither do the readers (the exception being situations where something completely incapacitates the character who can now do nothing other than scream, in which case the fact that there actually is a sentence dedicated just to it will make it all the more of a swerve for the readers when you don't stop for that in most fights). What takes three pages in normal writing, unless your style is already short and simple and quick should take no more than about one page when writing an action scene.
