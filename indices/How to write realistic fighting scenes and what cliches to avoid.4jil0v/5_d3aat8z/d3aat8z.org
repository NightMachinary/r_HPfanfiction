Fight scenes reflect the characters doing the fighting, and will flow depending on their personal reasons for fighting, and also on your word choice and sentence structure. I often liken it to writing a sex scene, actually. If Harry and Voldemort are duelling, the way they do so should in some way reflect either their personal clash or the moral conflict of the story as a whole. If it were Andromeda and Bellatrix duelling (just for example, work with me here) it should develop their characters and their relationship, for better or worse. They're sisters, and they used to know each other very well, so such a fight should reflect the emotional baggage of their wider relationship as sisters. Like... talking with wands, if you will, and things would probably get extremely vocal. If, instead, Harry and Voldemort are still fighting into Harry's thirties for instance, they might not even need to talk any more. Fighting the other has become so natural that they know what the other will do almost before they do it, which can be almost intimate in nature, even if they hate each other with every fibre of their being. For the record, I don't actually ship HPLV at all, and the thought kinda squicks me, but it's a dynamic I've seen work with other villain/hero shippings. Most notably KiGo, but I digress.

On the other hand, if the characters /don't/ know each other before a fight, e.g. Harry vs Voldemort in GoF, then you can use the way the characters behave when threatened to subtly hint to their worldview, or play up the tension between the characters with manoeuvering and standoffs. If they don't know each other, that makes each character seem more unpredictable in the other's eyes, so split-second decisions are made on shoddy information and it's more likely for someone to be caught completely off guard. Lord Voldemort is headstrong and sure in his own superiority, and his dynamic with Harry is very different to his dynamic with Dumbledore, yet those character traits still come through in both situations.

There's an ebb and flow to dramatic fight scenes, and dialogue can be very important, but don't have them stop to explain their abilities to each other, because that completely breaks the flow of a fight, not to mention being a boring anime clich√©. If these are enemies that know each other well, they may communicate via body language instead (again mirroring the sex-scene analogy). If they don't, subtle hints to body language is still super important, because it adds a certain ambiguity to a character's actions. 'What is Voldy going to try next?' sort of thing.
