- Have a good idea of where they are fighting; is it a room? Is it a field? Is it a corridor? This has a direct effect on the fighters in question-things like lighting, cover, ammunition and bystanders depend on where you are going to stage a fight. If it's a room, what's in it? If it's a corridor, how long until someone is likely to come along? If it's a field, is it covered in short/tall grass? Are there trees or animals anywhere? Are there holes in the ground that can make a character lose their footing? What?

- A fight is not a duel; the fighters aren't slugging it out on a flat plane. There's plenty of things that can provide cover, break line of sight, surprise the protagonist/enemy etcetera.

-Fighting is a dirty and painful business; someone's going to get hurt and it's going to hurt a lot. That should be reflected in the fight itself-any blow sustained by the fighters doesn't get walked off. Adrenaline or not, bruises and wounds slow the fighters down and distract them at critical moments.

-Just because they're fighting doesn't mean they aren't thinking; the fighters will be focused on one thing-taking down the enemy. There are plenty of different ways to do that. Figuring out how to do so whilst sustaining minimal damage/inflicting maximum damage on the enemy is something they'll be focusing on during the fight.

-Terrain dictates both tactics and weaponry/spell repertoire; using a grenade in a tightly enclosed space is suicide. So is swinging a claymore in a narrow alleyway. The fighters will have to adapt their fighting styles and ideas to suit the area around them.

-Have escape as an option; not all battles are fought to the bitter end. Some finish when one of the contestants manages to quit the field.

-A fight doesn't isolate the fighters from the Universe; shit's still going on elsewhere. If the fight spills over into an occupied area, the reactions of the spectators can well turn the fight around.

-Talking is a bad idea; Seriously, not a free action when you're rigorously beating the other fellow into a pulp.

-Know the weapons you are using; Be it a gun, a sword or a shield-figure out how the character is likely to use their weapon, accomodate the weight & length of said weapon during an engagement and capitalise on its strengths/weaknesses.

-Nobody's perfect; they don't all know Kung Fu or manage a bullet spread that'd put a sniper to shame. They don't all know how to turn a can of chili into mace or the x number of areas they're supposed to aim for. They can't all read an opponent's intent by the positioning of their feet and the flare of their nostrils. They're going to make mistakes and pay for said mistakes. They could lose or, if plot armoured, get the shit kicked out of them in the pursuit of inevitable victory. Guns will have their safeties still on, knives will tangle in their hiding places rather than slide out smoothly, swords will catch in scabbards and cocking rounds into the rifle will jam a thumb in the process. They're in a fight-clear thinking is not assured at all, shit's stressful and only extreme familiarity with either the weapon or the dance is going to keep them from basically fumbling at the exact wrong time-though even that's not an option. Oh, and dodging. Dodging's good, but gets painful when you dodge onto debris-strewn surfaces.

-Fighting is exhausting; between the stress, the injuries, things going wrong, running and dodging and fighting and almost dying, it won't take long for someone to tire in a fight.

- Shit breaks; furniture, people, tech, you name it-one stray attack and the room will be minus a couch for a while.

-FOR MAGIC: speed and mobility are both factors here. Ultra-complex spells that can flay an army alive but take five seconds to cast are out as the enemy will have flung five separate spells at them within said five seconds. Standing still whilst fighting is suicide, but casting spells on the run is not by any means a practiced thing. So the fighters are likely to stick to the basics until they're confident enough or have enough space to try something smart. Anything that has more than two or three wand movements is likely to not work-or backfire-in a fight.

Case in point-how come Voldemort spams the AK curse in battle? Because it's a) easy to cast, b) one shot, one kill upon connection and c) hikes up his enemies's stress levels considerably.

Same thing for Harry's /expelliarmus/, the reductor curse and so many others-simple movements, appreciable effects and rapid-fire capable.

Mobility is also heavily contested here, given the existence of apparition, portkeys and floo powder. They who dominate the field dominate the battle in this case.
