It is actually political parody. The one who play Drunkedore (Dumbledore) is czech president and the other who turned into paperbills was czech prime minister (minister of magic) And there was thousands of easter eggs mainly about czech politics, Czech fairy tales and bizzare but also international thing. So you could for example see John Travolta on trainstation, Vladim√≠r Putin in painting, Gandalf. And then there is thousands of easter eggs for which you would need to know czech realies.
