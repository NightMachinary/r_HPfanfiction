When I saw the title, I thought I meant all those fics that stopped updating once the main character(s) got to hogwarts.

Crazy idea though, i can't see it being real considering the lack of magical families to meet a 100 student quota. With your pessimistic view that magical children are extremely dangerous to each other, I doubt hogwarts would still be open in the 20th century. Rather, magical children would be educated in smaller schools with safety measures in place to make no one dies. Like-minded students from similar socioeconomic and statuses would find themselves segregated in the same schools, leading to educational differences and their many social consequences. The rich purebloods would have a richer education than halfbloods and muggleborns. Hogwarts supposedly has free tuition, paid for by the ministry; I doubt the MoM would cover all the educational costs in this world.
