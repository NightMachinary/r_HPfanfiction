Well, the idea goes with "The story as you know it is only the one the students remember", so of course they are not going to remember their peers who got killed. And honestly, JKR is sooooo bad at numbers. Her currency numbers, her population numbers, etc. You simply can't sustain a society the size of the one she showed with 32 kids/year.

I also think you are missing the premise here. The basis would be something like:

- Learning magic is dangerous: Kids who attempt to learn magic on their own / via self study blow themselves up / turn themselves into fine china 5 feet in the air 75% of the time.
- Not Learning magic is dangerous: Kids who refuse to learn magic are likely to accidentally tap their magic and the propability of an early death before 18 is 90%
- The best education one can buy (24/hour private tutor) greatly increases survivability, but 50% of the students still manage to off themselves
- In comparison, an institutional education provided economically to all students at a school like Hogwarts reduces the death rate to a good 60% or so by 18, however, introduces the trauma risk associated with seeing your peers permanently turn themselves into a pumpkin

Under such a situation, providing free schooling (indeed, getting all the ticking time bombs to a central, protected location so they don't cause damage if they go off) is something you can imagine. As long as the fatality rates of 'education' don't differ too much depending how much you spend, and the risk of people not being educated is high enough, you can easily see a "Everyone has to go to school because it protects general saftey"
