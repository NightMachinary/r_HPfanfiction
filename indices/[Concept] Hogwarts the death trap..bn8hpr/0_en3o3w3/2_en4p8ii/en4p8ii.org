Well you don't need it to be statute levels of secrecy. Simply the 'we wipe the students to prevent trama'. Maybe the family of muggleborns as well.

You would want a decent explanation. Such as ALL magic schools have high fatality rates. Deaths to other, preventable causes might get covered up as well, but it is primarily 'when teaching transfiguration, a certain percentage of your students end up permanently pumpkins'.

You could imagine a anti-bullying, saftey oriented school say in France taking longer and getting say, a lower 10% fatality rate.

Justifying it would be easy: uneducated wizards coming into their magic at home end up with a 90% self termination rate.

Kids get wiped because it is too much trama to see that much death at 12-16. Maybe they get told after OWLs or NEWTs.

Muggleborn parents wouldn't understand so they get convinced there was a car accident on the way home from Kings Cross.

Car accidents. Best thing for wizards since gas pipeline explosions.
