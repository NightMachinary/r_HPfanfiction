An interesting concept.... but what about a family's physical mementos? Photographs and the like, clothes, books, shoes? Memory charms could cause someone to forget, but their things would still be there.

The memory charm would have to stretch over the British isles---possibly farther for people who have international family.

Maybe Hogwarts rewrites reality in some way?
