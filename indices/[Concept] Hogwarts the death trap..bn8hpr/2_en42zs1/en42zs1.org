I remember reading a fic once that was a crossover with hunger games. Every year there are several deaths to things like the moving stairs. Obliviators try to cover it up. Hermione gets missed when one of her friends died and decides she's not going to let it happen to anyone else. She learns lots of spells and builds a bunch of enchanted items to help her save lives. I dont remember the name of the story but if you search hunger games crossovers on ff.net you might find it.
