I'm not sure how "Magical children are more durable so all the shit Neville went through is ok as long as he was magical" makes that situation any less horrifying because they were doing that to /test if he was magical/

Anyway, Ignoring Harry's adventures (Which are, clearly, a lot closer to mortal peril as is needed for the plot), it is easy to view Hogwarts as a mostly competent school.

It is also easy to view Hogwarts as a criminally undersupervised school where they give kids loaded weapons and don't teach a single thing about responsibility.

This thread would clearly be more toward the second version ;)
