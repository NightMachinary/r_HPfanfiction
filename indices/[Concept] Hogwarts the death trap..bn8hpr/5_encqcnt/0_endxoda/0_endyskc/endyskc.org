It doesn't make THAT situation any less horrifying - but it makes Hogwarts seem less of a deathtrap and more of a serious-injury-trap. I've seen theories posted that the magical power of new students is low enough to restrict them from abusing higher-level spells, but it doesn't really play out that way in canon.
