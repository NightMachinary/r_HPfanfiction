One definite answer is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][/The Well Groomed Mind/,]] already recommended by truncation_error.

Another, but less relevant one, is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][/On the Way to Greatness/.]] Here, Harry starts digging into Voldemort's ideology and propaganda and even takes into consideration (AFAIR) some of the things that Tom was\is trying to say (doesn't join him though).

There is also /HP & Descent into Darkness/, but I'd recommend against it because of its gradual deterioration. Its characters lose their resemblance to their original selves by each following chapter, the story becomes almost completely concentrated on romance and smut, etc.
