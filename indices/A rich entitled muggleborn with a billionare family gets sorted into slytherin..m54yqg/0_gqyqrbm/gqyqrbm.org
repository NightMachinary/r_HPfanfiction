[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13139149/3/The-Hidden-Duchess][A Hidden Duchess]] featuring a Slytherin!Hermione who is part of the British royal family has a similar hilarious exchange.

"What was that, Granger?" sneered Malfoy from the other table.

"Nothing, Malfoy," she sniffed prissily, "I was just saying that anyone can have a good broom, but it doesn't matter if they don't have a lick of talent in their bones. Honestly, you sound so horribly nouveau riche, with all the bragging you're doing Malfoy."

"My family goes back three centuries, Granger. We're anything but nouveau." he growled.

"Mine goes back nine hundred years." she said matter-of-factly. "So you're still nouveau compared to me."
