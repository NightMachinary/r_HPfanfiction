LeQuin's linkffn(Strange Reflections by LeQuin) I find quite amusing every once in a while. The PTSD comes across as pretty genuine and the sheer mustache-twirliness of the AU Potters as villains is simply hysterical, in a Dick Dastardly sort of way. It has its issues but overall I think it's pretty good.
