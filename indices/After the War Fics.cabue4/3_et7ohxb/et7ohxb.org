Solid length, has a sequel and 100% complete. Harry is an auror trying to round up the remaining Death Eaters. The inner circle death eaters are working on finishing what Voldemort started. Relationship issues, struggles with the past, and family centric. I haven't read it in a while but I thought it was nice.

I haven't read this in a long time but I think it was good? Don't quote me on that. It was either reaaaally underrated or reaaaaally bad I can't seem to remember lol.
