Well, my mother has red hair blue eyes and my father has brown/black hair brown eyes. My sister has dark red hair and brown eyes, I have bright red hair and blue eyes. My sister's husband has black hair, they have three children. Black hair, blue-eyed boy. Red-haired brown eyed girl. Brown haired brown eyed girl.

My mother remarried a blonde blue eyed man and had two more children. A blonde with reddish tints and blue-eyed girl and a red haired blue eyed boy.
