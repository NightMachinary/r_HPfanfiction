Black (‘BL') > Brown (‘Br') > Blonde (‘bl') > Red (r).

Lily has red hair, and the only combination that expresses red is ‘rr'. James has black hair, and the combinations that result in black hair are ‘BLX' where X could be any hair color gene including ‘BL'.

Harry has black hair, so his genes must be ‘BLX'. Since Lily could only pass on an ‘r', we can be certain that Harry has genes ‘BLr', meaning he is black haired and a carrier of the red hair gene. This means Harry's children can have black or red hair.
