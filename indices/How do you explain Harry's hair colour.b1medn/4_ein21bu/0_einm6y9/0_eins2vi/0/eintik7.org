I know what is taught in high school biology classes. It is my understanding, however, that that model is overly simplistic.

For example, if someone who you could reasonably expect to have exclusively BL/BL alleles (such as someone from most African countries and Asian countries) then by your model all children of those would have black hair also. However, that does not seem to be the case. Instead, it seems that nearly all black-haired people who have a children with a blonde-haired person or red-haired person will have brown-haired children.
