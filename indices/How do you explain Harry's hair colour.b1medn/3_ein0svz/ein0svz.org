His father had black hair and his mother had red hair. In this case the red hair was recessive while the black hair was dominant.

Heck; my older sister and her husband have twins, a girl and a boy; the girl has red hair while the boy has black hair, even though my older sister has dark brown hair and her husband has brown hair; red hair just happened to come up, because we seem to have a red haired person in the family once every generation; and apparently the black hair was dominant instead of brown this time around. It's totally possible.
