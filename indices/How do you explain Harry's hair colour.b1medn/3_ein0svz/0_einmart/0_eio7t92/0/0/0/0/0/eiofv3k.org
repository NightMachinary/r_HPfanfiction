"I knew a family that had twins; one was a boy the other a girl. The girl had red hair, the boy had black hair. They had a brother with black hair. I met the parents, the father had black hair and the mother had red hair. So by that the black hair was slightly more dominant, but the red hair was still common enough for the mother and daughter to get it."

You actually knew a couple who had the same hair colour as Harry's parents who had a child with black hair? Why didn't you lead with that?

"It just depends on the family genes, not every family is the same; some genes are more dominant then others; some are more recessive, but then you go to a different family and the genes that were recessive for one family is more dominant to another."

I think this might be more inaccurate than either the high school model and the website model.

"My younger sister has blue eyes that sometimes changes to green, depending on what she wears;"

I have a feeling that her eyes just look different in different contexts (similar to the yellow/white/blue/black dress thing) and don't actually change colour. But what do I know?
