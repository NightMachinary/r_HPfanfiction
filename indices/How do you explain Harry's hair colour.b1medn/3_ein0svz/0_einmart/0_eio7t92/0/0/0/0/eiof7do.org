Let's say person A has blonde hair

Person B has black hair

Their kid can have red hair or even brown hair, depending on their family ancestory. Or they could have blond or black, depending on what is the more dominant gene.

It just depends on the family genes, not every family is the same; some genes are more dominant then others; some are more recessive, but then you go to a different family and the genes that were recessive for one family is more dominant to another.

I knew a family that had twins; one was a boy the other a girl. The girl had red hair, the boy had black hair. They had a brother with black hair. I met the parents, the father had black hair and the mother had red hair. So by that the black hair was slightly more dominant, but the red hair was still common enough for the mother and daughter to get it.

My younger sister has blue eyes that sometimes changes to green, depending on what she wears; the blue eyes is because of her father (we have different dads but the same moms).

My older sister and I have dark brown hair, my mom has dark brown hair, my sister had dirty blonde hair growing up; because of the different dads, and because those genes decided to show themselves to my sister.
