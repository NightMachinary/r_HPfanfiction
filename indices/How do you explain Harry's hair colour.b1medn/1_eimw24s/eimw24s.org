Harry having black hair is entirely possible, it's just that this model is straight up incorrect. Black hair is dominant over brown which is dominant over blonde which is dominant over red. Technically it's entirely possible for Harry to have brown hair assuming James had a brown haired ancestor, but a black haired and red haired parent are in no way restricted to having only brown haired children.

Think about it. 80 percent of the human population has black hair. How would this be maintained if people with black hair couldn't have children with black hair? Are there large colonies of blondes producing hundreds of black haired children each?
