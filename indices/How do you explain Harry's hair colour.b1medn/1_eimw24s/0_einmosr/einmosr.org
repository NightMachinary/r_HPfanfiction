If two people with black hair have children, according to this model they will have black haired children.

"Are there large colonies of blondes producing hundreds of black haired children each?"

No, because even according to the model they cannot produce a black haired child.

"Black hair is dominant over brown which is dominant over blonde which is dominant over red."

If this is true, then for someone with black hair, half (or all, if they have two black-haired alleles) of their children would have black hair, regardless of the hair of the other parent.

Do you know of a black haired child with a blonde or red-headed parent? (Not saying this is impossible, just saying that it would happen more often if this was the expected result.)
