It's a bit of a love-it-or-hate it fic. The technical aspects (grammar etc.) are very solid, the plot makes a good deal of sense in-universe, it's long, and it's complete.

On the other hand, Harry is OOC, Ã¼berpowerful, and practically flawless, teaching Professor McGonagall a new method of transfiguration (that invalidates the entire wizarding technique and is far easier) on the first day of class. The antagonists are always outthought and there are no problems with the perfect, instant pairing. If you like those tropes, it's a great fic. If not, you'll probably put it right down.

I haven't read Harry Crow in a while, please correct any mistakes I may have made.
