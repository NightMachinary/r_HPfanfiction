linkffn(Innocent) - A story where Sirius escapes when Harry is 8, and raises him from then on. At some early points it seems like Harry might end up getting over-powerful, but that was (luckily) mostly nipped in the butt. Good Harry-Dirius interactions. Good characterisation of most other characters, too. Has one finished sequal and one which is in progress.

linkffn(Living with Danger) The first in a series of increasingly AU fan fics. Sirius, Remus and two others raise Harry, Hermione and two later additions together while in hiding. Begins relatively weak, gets better.Has some weirdness which does not gel too well with canon. It and all its sequals are finished, which is nice. This story has AUs, even and I prefer at least one of those to the actual main story... But reading it first would ruin some plot points from the main story, so I won't link.
