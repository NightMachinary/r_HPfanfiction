I really enjoyed linkffn(4062601) It's a story about Sirius taking Harry from the Dursley's when he was 8 and raising him. Pretty well written. There are some similarities that are similar to cannon, but the author took a different twist on it, like Harry thinking through the situation rationally as opposed just doing and not thinking.
