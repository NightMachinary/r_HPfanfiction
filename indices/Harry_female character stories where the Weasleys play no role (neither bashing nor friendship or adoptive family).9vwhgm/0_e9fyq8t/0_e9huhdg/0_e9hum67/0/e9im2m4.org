I do feel Harry/Katie (well, Harry/Older Quidditch colleague) is underused. I know some feel that you might as well use Ginny at that point, but I disagree. I don't think JKR was that into Older-Female - Younger Male pairings, I can't think of one in cannon.

I read through Wolf Lord. I usually avoid Werewolf fics, They tend to fall into the types of fics I really don't like, and sadly this one did as well. It had decent enough writing, so I didn't drop it immediately, but it certainly fell into the problems of the type:

WW fics tend to be the 'give Harry powers' type or the 'Justify why I am writing this' type (Why is it ok to write about Harry having a mega-harem? Well he is a creature of course! How to write a Harry/Lily fic without dealing with the squick? Well they are WW's so it is no big dead :|)

I have a strong dislike for fics that buff Harry's powers simply to let him glide through all challenges. I tolerate it better when it is earned (him going off to learn something), but less when it is just a way to cope out of challenges. Sadly, this fic falls into that. Harry's super-nose gets him through everything, he seems to have effortlessly removed all the downsides of being a ww, he is working on changing during the day with no negatives, etc. I don't see why authors need to give him more tools to deal with his problems, instead of using the tools he already has.

And it might seem contradictory, but I also don't like how it plot-armor's away problems with being a WW. A short section on how "Hey I'm a ww, I can claim my mother and sister" before choosing not to, which is just conveniently what fits with human society. If you are going to make it something like this, at least set it up as something that has to be worked through, not just hand-waved away. Hell, it would have been better for Harry to have American-WW training on how to deal with it ("This is the part of me that is Human that I do not give to the wolf side", allowing the struggle to come and be worked through, rather than it just happening that way.

Away from the WW, it also suffers from being set up as a kinda drama but not delivering any drama. There is no antagonist, no tension, no reason to care what the characters are doing. And it does the absolutely awful thing of having all of the character development in his age group relate to possible love interests of the main character. That is only somewhat justified in harem stories (and it really isn't), and not elsewhere. I always found stories where like ALL of the females his age have the hots for him, particularly when that wasn't the case in Cannon, to be stretching it. Given the hero worship in the society, you introduce harry without his history, he should be less attractive, not more.

That being said it had some good elements. The writing was fine, didn't feel rushed or too slow. The idea of Harry being a transfer student and thus being in many different classes was great. Harry's personality fit for a 'Harry raised differently'. Most of the Harry/Adult interactions were pretty good (Binns!). I was a bit disappointed at the beginning when all 4 of his family was WW, it would have been nice if one of them wasn't (Mother/Harry/Sister), to set up the dynamic of 'Human/WW interaction'. The whole intro into Hogwarts played out well, although it never felt like it progressed past the 'introducing Harry to Hogwarts' phase. Harry/Katies interactions were cute, but Katie is a bit of a cardboard cutout and needs more development than quick to anger.

It was ok to read through, but I don't think I'll be following it.
