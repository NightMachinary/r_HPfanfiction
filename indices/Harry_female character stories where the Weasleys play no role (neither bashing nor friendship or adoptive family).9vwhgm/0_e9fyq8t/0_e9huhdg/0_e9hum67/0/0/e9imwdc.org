Thanks for the feedback. Though it hurts to say you are probably right about some of it. I probably did get a bit bogged down. I thought I was doing a decent job of giving him challenges and costs to the powers but it seems not.

I know it has dragged in slowly through this first bit and I think it is in part because I have tried to have too much going on at the same time. To many plot points once. The next chapter is Katie focused and the one after will see Greyback kick James' as, but it is coming 130k in and that is pretty slow to happen.

More feedback is always appreciated. If you can direct to particular chapters or points that broke the story such as the examples here that would be awesome.
