A big point in his defense (ehh.. kind of..) is, that while 60 years old he is nowhere near mental maturity.

He consistently acts like someone in his early teens. Might be a half giant or a Hagrid thing, but it means you can't judge him as severely for his actions. Dumbledore means well by entrusting him with a little responsibility, but Hagrid just isn't ready for it.

The problem is simply a bad mix of good intentions and Hagrid's limited understanding of.. everything.
