I think this makes sense when you totally remove it from the context of the world it's set in. In those words yeah sure it looks bad on Hagrids part but none of his actions are unreasonable within the wizarding world.

For one, Hagrid knows damn well they know about magic, if he didn't he wouldn't be surprised that Harry knew nothing about it. Also that's another thing, you act like Dumbledore wanted Harry growing up scared and confused by his random outbursts of magic (that btw we are told happen when you're experiencing great emotion, that's not a sign of evil).
