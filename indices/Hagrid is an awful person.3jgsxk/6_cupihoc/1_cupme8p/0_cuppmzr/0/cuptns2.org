That's a cool little bit of head canon regarding the turning into an animal thing. I would be happy to run with that. Realistically though that isn't very likely since human transfiguration is studied 6th year. Transfiguration evidently being one of the hardest disciplines and not everyone continuing to that level. Hagrid certainly didn't. So as far as a series wide look at the situation- it was extremely hazardous. The tail was permanent. Dudley would have permanently been a pig or a partial pig until turned back by presumably Dumbledore or McGonagall (unless they were never told, as with the tail). I would think even if it was only hours that would be a traumatic experience.

It says Dudley howls in pain- maybe he is making the most of it (like fake crying earlier in the book) but it isn't written that way. Later after Diagon Alley I have read now that Dudley is still so frighten he runs from the room when Harry enters, on occasion screaming. The kids a bully but I just don't buy Hagrid punishing him in that moment as justifiable even if he knows everything (which I highly doubt).
