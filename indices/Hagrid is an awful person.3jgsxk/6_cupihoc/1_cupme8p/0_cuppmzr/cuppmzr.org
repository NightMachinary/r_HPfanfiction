  In the film Dudders eats Harry's cake, I can't quite remember if thats in the book

It's not in the book. It happens right after Vernon calls Dumbledore a "crackpot". Hagrid bellows out 'never insult Big D again!' and before you can say "poor impulse control" he gives Dudley his tail (which is described as a painful process for Dudley). I get the feeling that it's an old-timey form of punishment to temporarily turn a child into an animal representing their character flaw in the magical world (Draco to a ferret, Dudley to a pig). Adults usually lash out in the same form of punishment they received when children. That being said, I believe Dudley got swined only because of his weight, not for cake-snatching.
