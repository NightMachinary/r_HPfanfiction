While some of hagrids actions towards the dursleys might be justifiable there is one thing he does which cannot cannot be excused. He tries to turn Dudley , an innocent( base d on the information hagrid has) child who has done nothing but cower in fear since his arrival , into a pig. He does this after Vernon insults Dumbledore. Why not turn curse Vernon the actual source of your anger ? If hagrid feels that the dursleys are unfit parents for Harry should he not also pity there son who they have screwed up possibly worse than Harry ( who is unusually well adjusted considering ) ? But whatever its children's lit since we know dudley is a sack of shit from previous exposition its fine.
