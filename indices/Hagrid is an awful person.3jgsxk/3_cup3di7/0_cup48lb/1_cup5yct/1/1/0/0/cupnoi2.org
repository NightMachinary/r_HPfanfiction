For whatever reason (currying favor, showing off) Slug told Riddle. But the knowledge about making a horcrux was dangerous, and a responsible teacher would not divulge it under any circumstances. Anything Riddle said should not have changed that. It's like a chemistry teacher telling a student how to make ricin or nerve gas. It shouldn't matter if you think they are incapable of making it, or if they are a model student.
