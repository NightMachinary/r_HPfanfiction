  “He taught Arthur and me,” said Mrs. Weasley. “He was at Hogwarts for ages, started around the same time as Dumbledore, I think. Did you like him?”

  His mouth now full of bread, Harry shrugged and gave a noncommittal jerk of the head.

  “I know what you mean,” said Mrs. Weasley, nodding wisely. “Of course he can be charming when he wants to be, but Arthur's never liked him much.

Well, that just shows you, even Slughorn makes mistakes. I don't know whether Ron's told you in any of his letters --- it's only just happened --- but Arthur's been promoted!”
