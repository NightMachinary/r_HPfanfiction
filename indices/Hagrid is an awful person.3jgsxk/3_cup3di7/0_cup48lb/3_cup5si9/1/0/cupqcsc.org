I don't think Dudley and his gang beat Harry up inside the Dursley house. "Harry Hunting" sounds more like an outside game to me. Petunia may overlook a lot from Dudley, but the other children are not hers and I think she'd say something if she saw Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon pummeling Harry while Piers held his arms behind his back. I certainly don't think Mrs. Figg could see inside their house, which is why Hagrid was harsher to Dudley, since his bullying took place outside where Mrs. Figg could see it.
