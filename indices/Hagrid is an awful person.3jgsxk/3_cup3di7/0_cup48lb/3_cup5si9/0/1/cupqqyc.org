Ah, well, I'm not getting into the whole Dumbledore manipulation question, but suppose that what Mrs. Figg has seen is mostly Dudley and his gang beating Harry. That would explain Hagrid being so harsh on Dudley, but it's not evidence of guardian abuse, and in the 90's, bullying was seen as just part of life for children, something they had to learn to deal with. No one took it seriously until after the school shooting at Columbine, I would say. There was certainly no movement to stop it and if you reported it you would just get laughed at. Certainly no one would suggest removing a child from a home due to bullying by other children, no matter how brutal it was. (And I will say again, having one child hold Harry's arms behind his back while four others punch him is pretty damn brutal)
