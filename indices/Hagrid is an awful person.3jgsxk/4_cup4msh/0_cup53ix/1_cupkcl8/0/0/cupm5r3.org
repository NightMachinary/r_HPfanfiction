I mean he's clearly talking in hogwarts terms. The snetence wouldn't have the same effect if it was "There's not a single witch or wizard wo went bad who wasn't in slytherin, out of those who attended Hogwarts"

At this time /most/ slytherins are bad. On Harry's year, 4 of the 5 boys are death eaters kids, and the other is the son of a woman who were all but told assassinated all her 7 rich husbands for the money. And the kids subscribe to their values, because obviously that's how they were raised.

So yeah, Slytherin's house is incredibly rotten and you can't deny that. how many other evil non-slytherins can you name, really? There's Pettygrew (Which at the time people thought it was Sirius, so the numbers add up), I guess Grindewald was a gryffindor? Can't remember. Who else?
