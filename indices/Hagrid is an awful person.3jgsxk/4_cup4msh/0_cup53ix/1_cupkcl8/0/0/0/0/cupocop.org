Oh yeah he was from some weird place up north wasn't he? Yes, I did read the books, I'm sorry for not having a photographic memory.

The sentence needs to have an effect. Jk is using Hagrid to introduce us to the world of wizardry. And that sentence /is not that much of an exageration as you're making it up to be/. That is my point. QUirrel wasn't a Dark Wizard at all, Voldemort manipulated him, just like he did with a handful of others. And even if he did, that's like, what, 2 non-slytherins out of the like, 50?

Again, as far as hyperboles go, it's a pretty tame one.
