Man, are you trolling me? Grindelwald didn't even go to Hogwarts. That's why I named him. Did you even read the books?

Why does the sentence have to have any effect, anyway? what's so great about prejudicing Harry against Slytherin? Rowling herself claimed that all Houses had their share of Dark Wizards. If you really want a canon example, Quirrell was a Ravenclaw.

My point is, that hyperbole was totally out of place, and thus, Hagrid isn't reliable. Harry completely took him for his word, never thinking "Oh, Hagrid was just exaggerating".
