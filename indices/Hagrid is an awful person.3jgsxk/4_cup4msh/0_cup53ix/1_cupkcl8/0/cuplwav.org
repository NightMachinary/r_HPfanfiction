It's a very exaggerated hyperbole. Think of it like that: most of the wizards in the world don't go to Hogwarts, and thus couldn't have been in Slytherin. Still, there are enough bad ones among them. Did Hagrid think that Grindelwald was in Slytherin? he's talking without thinking, and thus unreliable, and we can all see the results of this hyperbole.
