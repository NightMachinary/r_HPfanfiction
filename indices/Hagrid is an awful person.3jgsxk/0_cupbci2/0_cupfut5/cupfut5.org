This is the same reason for excusing Dumbledore leaving Harry on the doorstep in November instead of simply knocking.

It's fine explanation if you stick to the first couple of books. However, as soon as you bring the other books into the mix, things get more complicated. It's not possible to read later scenes while simply dismissing scenes in the first book as "kids lit." You can't read Dumbledore's "ten dark and difficult years" while ignoring what the first book describes those years as being like.

That's JKR's fault for starting with kids lit then progressing to YA fantasy. On the one hand, doing so created a series that kids could grow up with, which is absolutely wonderful. She deserves lots and lots of praise for that.

On the other hand, it created plot and character problems by the bucket load.

But you know what? It's precisely those problems which help fuel HP fanfiction. I believe it is, in fact, one of the main reasons why there is so much more HP fanfiction than there is in other fandoms.
