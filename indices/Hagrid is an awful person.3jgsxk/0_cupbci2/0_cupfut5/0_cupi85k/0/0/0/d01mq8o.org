No it isn't - Dumbledore could give him to somebody else (sorry, but screw the blood-wards, they aren't worth the neglect that happened to Harry because the Dursleys just didn't like him), establish some wards (add a fidelius with himself as the secret keeper) and you have a home that's 99% as secure as the Dursley home and add that Harry's better off and even more so if the people he's given to have defense/combat-training (so they could stall or even fight of deatheater-remnants in case all the wards fail, which the Dursleys can't...they can't even fight Hagrid who's not the greatest wizard ever and only really has his physical strength going for him!)
