Sure, there are lots of things that a wizard in theory might do, not to mention the need to ensure Harry sleeps - he's a toddler, which means he may be physically capable of wandering off.

But the fact is that he doesn't do anything. Readers have to create such an event in their heads in order to preserve their mental image of Dumbledore not being a jerk. Of course, even with such reader-created actions, what Dumbledore did is still technically a crime. I believe it was 10 years in prison at the time, but I don't remember for sure now.

And what's more, it wouldn't justify not just /knocking on the door/. Wizards can do amazing things, and one thing they are definitely capable of doing is using their fist to knock on a piece of wood. To, you know, say hello. Maybe /ask/ if a family is financially and emotionally capable of handing the care of second infant. It doesn't matter how great the so-called blood wards are if the family is barely getting by or if Petunia is suffering from severe post-partum depression.

And finally, Dumbledore didn't do any of those imaginary things to make the cold and wet irrelevant because that's just not done in fairy tales, which is what the book is basically modeled after. Harry is a version of Cinderella, and in that context we are supposed to ignore such things. Dumbledore's lack of basic human decency is irrelevant in a fairy tale.
