This. Remember, the Dursleys have been going to all sorts of ridiculous lengths to keep Harry from getting his Hogwarts letter. Whatever magical feedback system keeps tracks of such things has undoubtedly kept Dumbledore informed of their efforts. Hagrid has been dispatched to do something that is not only tiring to him, but to his mind, should be entirely unnecessary--why would any decent guardians of a child try and prevent him from attending Hogwarts. When Hagrid discovers that Harry doesn't even know about his own powers, heritage, or family, of course that sends him over the top. I, too, was bothered by Hagrid's use of the word 'Muggles' when I first considered it, but like any word, it can have a lot of situational changes in meaning. In this case, it's pretty obvious that he's mad at the Dursleys for their willful ignorance, not blaming them for not being magical. As far as Dudley goes--Hagrid had to listen to him whine, and his parents didn't help matters much. Wizards, after all, are big on family as a predictor of behavior, for better or worse.
