To Hagrid, Harry is in a custodial hostage/kidnap-type situation. He's being forcibly kept from his world and his heritage. Therefore it makes sense that he smashes in the door, just as the police would do in a similar instance.

He is then greeted by a shotgun. By US police logic, he would have been justified in killing Vernon. Fortunately Hagrid is a wizard and a half-giant and so he has other ways of controlling Vernon. He's able to take the gun and disable it rather than getting anyone killed.

Hagrid is attempting to calm the Dursleys by asking for tea. It's the civilized British thing to do and a signal to them that he isn't planning on harming or scaring them further. Sitting down is more of the same. He's trying to defuse the situation.

Yes, it would have been more polite to introduce himself first but they've already gone beyond polite and the Dursleys know that he's there for Harry. It's better for Hagrid to go straight for the non-threatening body language before he attempts to reason with them.

The "great lump" remark is out of line, yes, but we don't know what sort of tone of voice Hagrid says it in. Keep in mind that he probably hears the same sort of thing himself all the time, and if it's said in a friendly tone of voice it's not really that different from the sort of friendly insult guys give each other frequently.
