When Vernon demands Hagrid leave, of course Hagrid isn't going to leave. Remember, to Hagrid, Vernon has just freaking kidnapped Harry Potter and dragged him out here to the middle of nowhere to keep him from the wizarding world. He's not a "rightful renter", he's a kidnapper in a criminal hideout. So Hagrid gets angry and insults him.

Now, Vernon and Petunia both know about magic, and Hagrid knows it. Lily and James met with Petunia and Vernon and invited them to their wedding before their deaths. Presumably they would have talked about this to their friends, the circle of which included Hagrid and Dumbledore, so Hagrid would already know that Vernon knew magic. Also it's not Hogwarts policy to conceal the existence of magic from the parent/guardians of its students, so regardless of whether Vernon knew or Petunia kept it from him, he would have learned that day anyway.

One thing I agree with you on is that Hagrid's treatment of Dudley is rather despicable. For the "great pudding of a son" remark, he's not really trying to hurt Dudley, though, he's trying to insult Vernon. Hagrid is just not the best thinker out there. Whether he doesn't know or doesn't care about hurting Dudley's feelings, it's not good either way.

I do wonder if possibly Dumbledore has briefed him before his mission to collect Harry. Hagrid might know about Mrs. Figg's reports on Privet Drive, and he could be aware that Dudley is a bullying git who frequently beats up on Harry with a gang of other boys, and that might be a reason for his harsh treatment of Dudley in this chapter.
