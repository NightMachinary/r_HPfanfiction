If I could I would have parsed things down and word it better (up way too late... or early), particularly the Hagrid, Dursleys and magic etc. but thank you for seeing past my faults to what I really meant.

to anyone late: Dudley- this is really what the problem was for me. I don't care if Hagrid knows every sordid detail of Harry's treatment by Dudley- belittling, terrifying, and quite literally scarring the boy here and now is distinctly uncool. I don't even know how to argue the fact other than repeat his actions... it's like Snape or no lets use Draco calling Neville a 'great lump' (one of the insults Hagrid used), Neville 'deserves' that too- he has lost his toad, melted a cauldron, and broken his wrist off a broom. Yet Draco, a boy, is clearly represented as being bad here.
