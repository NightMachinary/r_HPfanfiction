The bit about Hagrid hexing Dudley rather than Vernon because of something Vernon did is just his medieval way of thinking, something quite present in the wizarding world as a whole. In that time, if an adult insulted you and you took revenge by doing something to his kid, it counted as harm to the kid's father and not to the kid (or at least not foremost to the kid).

Weird? Sure. But that's how it was, and that's what Hagrid's attack was; for all he knows, that's the legit way to harm Vernon for his insult.

PS. Many things are like that in the early books. If you look at it in the context of medieval times, it's nothing weird, but if you look at it through the filter of what is now, it becomes really weird and out of place. The detention in the forest, the whole leaving a kid on the doorstep thing, those are just two such examples.
