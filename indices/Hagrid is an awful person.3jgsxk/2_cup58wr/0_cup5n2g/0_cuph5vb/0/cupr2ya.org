Neville's actions are all accidents and unintentional, though. Losing his toad and breaking his wrist aren't things Snape should care about- they hurt only Neville. Yes, Neville is clumsy in potions and has melted more than one cauldron, but he doesn't mean to, and part of the reason he's so clumsy is that he's terrified of Snape.

Dudley on the other hand spends most of his time "Harry hunting". Let me reiterate what that involves. Dudley is the leader of a gang made of himself and four other boys. They chase down Harry and one of them, Piers Polkiss, holds Harry's arms behind his back while Dudley, Malcolm, Dennis, and Gordon punch him. That's intentional and it's pretty damn cruel. If this is what Mrs. Figg is reporting, is it any wonder Hagrid has a bad opinion of Dudley?
