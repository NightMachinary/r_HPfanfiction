Harry is a petulant man-child, and Ron is diminished to a feeble form of comic relief. The Ministry of Magic has terrible security, even twenty-two years after the Golden Trio's Gringotts heist. JKR attempts to justify Cedric Diggory's death and - for some reason - her choices of Yule Ball dates. The readers are treated to the classic “butterfly effect” lesson about time travel in the least creative way possible. Also, Voldemort had a secret daughter with Bellatrix, and Albus is crushing on her. Eventually, after all of the effort they've exerted into attempting to change the present by meddling with the past, Albus and Scorpius set things back the way they were. Harry finally accepts that his kid is a Slytherin, which was what he promised to do in the epilogue of /Deathly Hallows/. The only good things about it were the trolley lady and Hermione being Minister of Magic.
