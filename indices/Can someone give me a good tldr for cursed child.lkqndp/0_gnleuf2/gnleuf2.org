Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy use a special Time Turner to go back decades, trying to make the war turn out better (saving Cedric) but instead they create a succession of really bleak outcomes (eg Cedric becomes a Death Eater and Voldemort wins), which turn out to have been orchestrated by Voldemort's secret daughter Delphi. Eventually they capture Delphi and restore the original timeline with their parents' help.
