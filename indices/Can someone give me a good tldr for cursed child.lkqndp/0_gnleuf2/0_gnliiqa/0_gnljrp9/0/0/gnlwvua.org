I didn't read the script, instead I waited the three years for the production to come to my country. The quality of the stage production is amazing, so amazing in fact that I didn't start to realise all the faults with it until a few weeks later. Would I ever read the script? No. Would I ever see the play again? Maybe. Do I regret seeing it the first time? Not at all.
