Honestly how sad is it that the production is the thing people praise about the cursed child? I mean everyone loves A very Potter musical for example, no matter that you have to watch it in low quality on YouTube. A good production should be like a bonus or a tool to make a good story even better, and not something to make a play with an awful story kind of watchable. If you write a script and it would be unwatchable with a low budget production then you should rewrite your script not throw a lot of money at it and hope people will look past it because „oh but it looks pretty“.
