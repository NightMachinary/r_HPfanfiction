Hmm. Yes and no. There /are/ cases where things are all about the performance rather than the story. Consider "Cats", which has only a small and not very impressive plot, but spectacular choreography. That works.

HP8 can't afford to do the same, though, I think. Partly because it's the successor to a series where the plot does matter, and a weak plot makes it not mesh with the existing work. Partly because the plot isn't just weak, it makes several people wildly out of character in ways that are insulting to them (eg claiming that Cedric would join Voldemort because he got embarrassed).

Perhaps I need to think of CC a bit like Fantastic Beasts, as a story that can be decent so long as you don't assume it's associated with Harry Potter. Harder to do in this case, though, with the Halloween 1981 subplot.
