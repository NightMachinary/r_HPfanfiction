I always find it disappointing that only fanfiction is allowed to succeed in going back and changing time for the better. Conventionally published works almost invariably have to end with changing everything back to how it was, perhaps with minor variations like Back to the Future making Marty's dad more assertive and successful, but fundamentally unsuccessful in what they set out to do.
