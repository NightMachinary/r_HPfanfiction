OK just a couple questions because I am very confused and feel like I just read a really bad Fanfiction.

On #3 (first paragraph) they go back in time twice? The first time to sabotage the tournament, return to their time; the second time to humiliate Cedric, return to their time; at which point only Scorpius returns because Albus doesn't exist anymore?

#3 second paragraph is where I really got lost. What does Scorpius escape from? His popularity? I'm assuming the Snape, Ron, and Hermione that are on the run are from the new future where Harry died? When you say They reach their own timeline, who do you mean? Also how does it go from Scorpius with the previous 3 to the trio plus Draco and Ginny if Harry is supposed to be dead?

I don't understand #4 at all lmao.
