Sorry- I just reread my post and I can see how It's confusing.

#3 First paragraph-

Albus and Scorpius go back in time to make sure that Cedric doesn't die in the third task. In order to do this, they decide to make Cedric fail the 2nd task so that he'll get eliminated and stop competing. They disguise themselves as Dumstrang students and attempt to get Cedric to fail. Their plan/idea doesn't work. When they return to their time, they realise that somehow, due to their actions, Ron doesn't marry Hermione, but rather get's married to Parvati. They realise that they have obviously f-ed up the timeline, as Rose and Hugo (Ron and Hermione's kids) don't exist because Ron and Hermione never got together.

Realising that they messed up, they go back to fix the timeline once again. This time, they do some different things to get Cedric eliminated from the 2nd task. (Remember: They don't want Cedric to get humiliated- they just want him to get eliminated.) Their idea/plan works this time, and they go back to their time thinking that they've fixed everything. They haven't fixed anything, though.

Cedric, after getting eliminated, gets furious and becomes a death-eater. This changes the whole timeline for the worse.

The results of Cedric turning dark are- 1.Umbridge takes over hogwarts, Neville dies, Harry dies, and Voldemort wins the war. When Scorpius-Albus return to their time, Scorpius can't find Albus anywhere. This is because Harry died during the Battle. No Harry = No Albus.

#3 Second Paragraph-

When I say 'Scorpius escapes', I mean that he escapes from the shitty timeline where Voldemort won. He doesn't want to live in a world like that, without his best-friend. He finds Snape at Hogwarts and gets his help. Snape is not on the run. He's at Hogwarts, for some reason. Ron and Hermione, on the other hand, are on the run.

When I mean 'their own timeline' I mean the timeline where they were originally from- the timeline where Harry never died and is a head auror, where Rose and Hugo are alive.

There are 2 parts of CC that go on during the same time- One part is Albus-Scorpius' time travel adventure, while the other part is Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Draco looking for Albus and Scorpius.

  Also how does it go from Scorpius with the previous 3 to the trio plus Draco and Ginny if Harry is supposed to be dead?
#+end_quote

Harry is only dead in one timeline- in Albus and Scorpius' original timeline, Harry is alive and looking for his son.

#4 In the Extra Information, I mentioned that Harry gives Albus Harry's old blanket as a present or something. This blanket is the one Harry was wrapped in when he was left at the Dursleys. Albus, predictably, throws it away. When Albus-Scorpius find out that Delphi is actually evil, she kidnaps them and brings them to 31 October 1980 (The day Harry was orphaned) because she wanted to speak to Voldemort. The two of them (Scorpius-Albus) realise what Delphi is trying to do, and want to send The trio + Ginny, Draco a message about where they are. Albus remembers the blanket Harry gifted him, steals it from Lily and James who are alive and living in Godric's Hollow and write the date (31 Oct 1980) on it so that The trio know where to find them.

The trio, meanwhile, find that Delphi is evil and has kidnapped Scorpius and Albus. They also find out that she's time travelled to somewhere. Harry somehow finds the blanket in Albus' room, and sees the date. The trio attempt to go back in time, but have no time turner to do it. Miraculously, Draco has a time turner. They use it to go to October 31 and find Delphi, Scorpius and Albus.

I had mentioned earlier that Delphi wanted to talk to Voldemort. The trio decide to trap Delphi by pretending to be Voldemort, which Harry does. They subdue her. The End.
