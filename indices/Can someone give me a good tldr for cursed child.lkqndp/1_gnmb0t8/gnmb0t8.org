There is already a pretty decent summary in this thread, but if anyone wanted a longer one with more details or something-

(Warning: Bit longer)

1.Albus Potter is sorted into Slytherin and befriends Scorpius Malfoy (Slytherin). As the years pass, he feels more and more isolated from the rest of his classmates, as he behaves nothing like Harry and is a bit anti-social (He was shit at flying, for example). Harry is also a dick to him, even telling him "I wish you weren't my son," at one point.

2.Cedric's father, Amos, wanted Harry to go back in time and save Cedric, as Harry (Head Auror) had recently acquired a time turner in an auror raid. Harry refused, but Albus had overheard this and decided to save Cedric with Scorpius' help by stealing the time turner. They were accompanied by /'Cedric's cousin'/, Delphi. During this time, Harry's scar begins to hurt.

3.They go back in time to Harry's 4th year, and try to sabotage the tournament, but fail. This caused Ron to somehow marry Parvati Patil instead of Hermione. Realising that they messed up, They go back and humiliate Cedric during the 2nd Task, the consequences of which are- Cedric becoming a death eater, Dolores Umbridge becoming the headmistress, Harry dying during the Battle, Neville dying and Voldy winning the war. Albus does not exisit, so Scorpius, who is somehow very popular, has to try and fix the timeline.

Scorpius escapes and fixes the timeline with the help of (a very OOC) Snape, and Ron and Hermione, who are on the run. They reach their own timeline, and attempt to destroy the time turner, but Delphi stops them, kidnaps them, and brings them to October 31, 1981. The trio + Draco and Ginny look for their kids, realising that 1.Delphi is Voldy's daughter 2.She kidnapped Scorpius and Albus 3.There was a prophecy that would allow Voldemort to come back.

4.Albus writes a message on a blanket, which the trio (who are in the future) see. They travel back in time with /Draco's/ time turner (which he had been hiding all along). Harry disguises himself as Voldemort using Transfiguration to distract Delphi, subdues her, and fixes the timeline.

..................................................

Extra information:

1.James Sirius Potter is a Gryffindor, who inherited the cloak from Harry. Lily Luna (Gryffindor, I think) got some fairy wings or something. Albus got Harry's old blanket (the one he had worn the night his parents died).

2.Scorpius likes Rose Granger-Weasley. They don't get together.

3.Delphi is called 'The Augurey' in the 2nd timeline.

1. The three (Scorpius, Albus, Delphi) steal the time turner from Hermione's (Minister of Magic) office by polyjucing themselves as the trio. When the school year starts, the two of them escape the Hogwarts Express by climbing onto the top, and are confronted with a demonic version of the trolley lady. It is somewhat at this point that the trio realise that Albus is missing.
