I have no idea about these fics being A Thing (please recommend any good ones where Sirius sees a shrink, if indeed they are trending). That said, I have impressed many people with how "normal" and "intelligent" I am despite having oh so many problems.

The idea that you don't have issues unless you're screaming babble in the corner is kind of... I don't know if it's insulting or dangerous or just wrong. Probably a combo of those?

I mean, go to the average real prison. Those guys are mostly not in a fetal position repeating a mantra or something. You can have normal conversations with them. Many will just "look bored". Odds are the vast majority of them would still benefit from a psychiatrist. Either to work through trauma (which they're disproportionately likely to have endured), or to deal with illnesses (which they're more likely to have. Which, hey, when you realize the mentally ill are overrepresented in prisons AND still more likely to be the targets of a crime than commit a crime... That's super fucked up).

So... Those are my two cents.
