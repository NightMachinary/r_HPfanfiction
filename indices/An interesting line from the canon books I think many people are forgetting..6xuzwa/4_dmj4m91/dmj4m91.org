...Now that makes me wonder. If Sirius was so calm and collected in Azkaban, despite the dementors, why didn't he retain that calmness and rationality once he escaped? Send an owl to Lupin that "BTW, I didn't do it, Peter was the Secret Keeper all along. Also, I'm pretty sure he's alive and hiding as the Weasleys pet rat, look at the missing toe."

I suppose there could be a number of reasons for that, aside from the Doylist perspective of 'things need to go this way so a relatively-normal teenager ends up saving the wizarding world'.

It might be that after Sirius escaped Azkaban, his emotions came surging back, and he abandoned the idea of a rational compromise in order to try and kill Peter himself. Harry does similar when Sirius is killed in book 5, going after Bellatrix alone.

Or maybe he was paranoid and believed that Dumbledore, Fudge, and the like would cover their ears and have him Kissed rather than investigate Peter's survival; considering that the Dementor's Kiss was authorised on sight, while Dumbledore was the Chief Warlock, Crouch was still in the Ministry (though not in law enforcement), and Malfoy and his ilk were not-in-Azkaban, he might have considered all of them suspect. This briefly comes into play in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3595986/1/Fugitives-of-Azkaban][Fugitives of Azkaban]], where Sirius ends up in a three-way duel with Voldemort and Dumbledore at the end.

And, another quote for you:

  "If it can, the Dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself... soulless and evil."

There's a what-if lurking in there; what if Sirius's overexposure to the dementors corrupted him and turned his 'I am innocent' into 'everyone else is guilty', and he broke out with the goal of not just killing Peter, but everyone else responsible (in his eyes) for killing James & Lily and letting Peter get away?

Like, your average 'Harry is betrayed and wrongly sent to Azkaban, gets revenge on everyone', but with Sirius instead?
