Extrapolating this quote as proof of sanity is an over simplification with many flaws:

1. Several have already stated that acting normal does not mean you are okay so I won't elaborate.

2. When was the last time Fudge inspected Azkaban? Mental states deteriorate over time and with added isolation and dementors that's brutal.

3. Fudge is a politician and a total jerk off, who's to say he wasn't lying to sound impressive?

4. If the Minister was to visit Azkaban the dementors would surely be removed from the areas he was visiting, so he wouldn't have experienced the full madness of an inmate subjected to that torture.

5. Fanfiction is a creative take on the universe, even canon stories allow author freedom. If you don't like it you don't have to read it. Authors work hard to produce thier stories and shouldn't have to try and please every reader.
