Hi, thanks for the response.

1. Completely agree. Sirius wasn't OK, but he wasn't catatonic either.

2. Not sure how I'm meant to answer that. No doubt Azkaban is brutal, and you're correct in that it may have been even more than a year or so since Fudge met Black.

3. JK Rowling, as the author, wants us to know more about Sirius Black. Fudge is irrelevent this early into the series.

4. The same would have been true if the Minister visited other inmates too; and they were in much worse condition than Sirius.

5. I know, it's what I most enjoy about reading fanfiction. I think sometimes that one author decides to rewrite canon one way and suddently it becomes the /thing to do/ for many authors to treat Sirius in their own stories, instead of looking for interesting avenues to explore his rehabilitation (i.e. through bonding with Harry or Remus / through hobby etc.)

I'm a fanfic writer myself.
