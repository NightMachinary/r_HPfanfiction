One thing maybe to consider perhaps -given the quote- is that if the minister was visiting Sirius and spending time near enough to chat then the minister was likely being protected by patronus and potentially the dementors guarding Sirius had been moved away to protect the minister. Perhaps Sirius was in higher spirits that day as he got some human company and a lessening of the dementor effect. Potentially Sirius wanted to project calm and rational for his own purposes either to make him feel normal all make him seem normal etc. Sirius was clearly, given his actions in the series neither someone who had fully recovered the trauma of the previous war, to a degree his childhood or his stint in Azkaban but he was also someone who was not totally broken and was still able to function. I'd be interested to see, if he had survived, if he could function seemlessly in a non-violent society after a childhood of dark magic, vitriol and ruthlessness and having spent his postschool years immediately drafted into a war/auror(?) and shadow war societies where violence/ruthlessness would have held him in good stead then years in prison reliving all of the worst bits of that only to be released and living as a dog and then being held under house arrest in his childhood home with an old rival picking at your insecurities..
