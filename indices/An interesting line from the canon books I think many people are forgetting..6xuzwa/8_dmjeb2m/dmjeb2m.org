What really makes me sad is the thought that this quote basically overtly states that Azkaban is basically a prison where they lock up mentally ill people.

Dementors suck the life out of people but they don't suck out their sanity. It honestly makes me think about how we have a long history of throwing people with mental illnesses into prison and basically leaving them in horrific conditions until they die.
