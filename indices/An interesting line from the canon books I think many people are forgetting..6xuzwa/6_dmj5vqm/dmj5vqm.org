Not that I have personal experience with the kind of isolation and abuse that Sirius had gone through in Azkaban, but with my own personal mental health struggles, it's generally easier for me to keep it together in the moment and then /afterwards/ is what really fucks me. Not that I'm saying that this is a universal experience, of course.
