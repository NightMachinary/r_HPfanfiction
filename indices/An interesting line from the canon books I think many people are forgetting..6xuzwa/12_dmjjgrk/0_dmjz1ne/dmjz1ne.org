Thanks for the response. I'm really not refuting your opinion - I agree completely.

But in a world where Sirius was denied a trial and summarily thrown in prison I just don't believe any assistance after the fact would be shown towards him (through legal avenues).

My primary belief is that Remus helped him while they reformed the Order.
