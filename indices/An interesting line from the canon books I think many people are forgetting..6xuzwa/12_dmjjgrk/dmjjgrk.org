Insanity doesn't mean you have to be a raging lunatic. While Sirius wasn't as affected as others were, partly due to his animagus abilities, he was still held in solitary confinement for over 12 years. His only company at that time were Dementors....not the best mates to have. Let's not forget that the conditions in Azkaban are deplorable.

No matter how calm Sirius looked, he definitely needed treatment. That's basic human psychology.
