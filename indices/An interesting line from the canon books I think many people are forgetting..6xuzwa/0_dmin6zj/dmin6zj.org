He's not psychotic, but that doesn't mean he wasn't damaged by the decade long stint in Azkaban. There could easily be periods of time where he gets flashbacks or has difficulties keeping it together mentally. Heck there are people who have issues from just going to real life prisons where they aren't mentally abused day in and day out. Regardless, I don't think he's as bad as some fanfic writers make him out to be.
