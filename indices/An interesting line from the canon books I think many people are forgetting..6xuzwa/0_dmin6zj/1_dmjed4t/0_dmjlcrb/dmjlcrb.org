  He keeps on referring to Harry as James
#+end_quote

Not in the books, and even in the movies it was only that one time at the DoM. We do get this:

#+begin_quote
  "He's not an adult either!" said Mrs Weasley, the colour rising in her cheeks. "He's not James, Sirius!"

  "I'm perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly," said Sirius coldly.

  "I'm not sure you are!" said Mrs Weasley. "Sometimes, the way you talk about him, it's as though you think you've got your best friend back!"
#+end_quote

It's suggestive, but I think Molly's opinion is somewhat biased so this can't be taken as definitive proof that Sirius thinks Harry=James. There is a scene later in OOTP where Sirius expresses disappointment at Harry not taking a risk that Sirius claims James would, implying that Sirius wishes/would prefer that Harry was more like James, but at no point does Sirius actually call Harry "James" or do anything else to explicitly indicate that he's mentally mixing the two of them up.

All that said, I do agree he needs therapy.
