Ah...no. Just because someone gives off the appearance of being fine dones't mean they are, and thus doesn't require a psych eval. You can't just spend five minutes with someone and declare them okiedokie. Plenty of psycho/sociopaths know exactly what to say/do to get what they want.\\
In Siri's specific case, however, Padfoot dampened the effects of the Dementors, but didn't block them completely. He could use a bit of therapy.\\
Besides, in many places, a full psychological workup is standard procedure regardless. A general eval and a day or two in St Mungo's to make /sure/ he's fine is a perfectly reasonable response.\\
Days/weeks in some kind of treatment regime? (Probably) not required.
