linkffn(HP and the summer of change by lorddwar) was well written, and I enjoyed it. It's been a while ago, so I don't remember the details, but I remember it having some issues. Nothing major, but irritating.

Spelling errors, overpowered Harry, clich√©s.

Worth reading once, but maybe not worth re-reading.
