Yup.

Unless he has his mind and personality magically raped (or he's given a radically different backstory in a fic to the point where he's HINO), do you really think Harry, as we know him in canon, would accept being some sort of bizarre, submissive, unequal slave or toy in such a "relationship"?

Playmate, with Gabrielle naively forcing a bond on him, is the sort-of realistic direction I'd see such an attempt heading in.

Same deal if (unfortunately, most commonly male) the other part of such a 'pairing' was Malfoy, or Snape, or even Voldemort was the 'submissive' half.
