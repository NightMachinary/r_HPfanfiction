99% of these sort of stories involve (IMHO, terribly contrived) slash, but aside from Playmate, which [[/u/sailingg]] already linked, I can't think of any others.

I mean, I think the closest you can get are the stories where he has a soul-bond trope with another witch, like (and most commonly) Hermione or Ginny, that could go either way depending on how they react in each individual story, but creatures? Drawing a bit of a blank.

Which is kind-of sad, since the existential, body, and/or psychological horror of such a plot would be /immense/.

Imaging knowing that your mind and very personality are being slowly warped or changed by this /parasite/ forced on you, and knowing that soon you won't even care or may even 'love' the idea of being this bitch's mate, or husband, or plaything... and the only 'out' is death, since killing her would result in a face /worse than death for yourself./

It could even be more tragic if the bond was like this on /both/ ends, making both parties victims: to use a first thought of character, say Fleur.

This curse is slowly raping both your minds and personalities to be comfortable with, compatible with, and eventually love one another, and while it's happening all thoughts of trying to break it are slowly dulled or suppressed.

Neither has any choice in the matter: their free-wills are being irrecoverably eroded.

So, death for yourself (if the bond even /allows/ you to think of suicide or murder/suicide) or being twisted.

Christ, that'd be fucking dark.
