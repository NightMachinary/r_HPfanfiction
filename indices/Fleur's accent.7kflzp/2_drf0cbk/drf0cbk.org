Like others say, in Fleur's case it's better to tone down her accent, especially if she has a lot of dialogue. (And especially do not go the Chris Claremont route of just inserting minor French words in her speech like "oui" or "non.")

If she has a lot of spoken lines, less is definitely more. Have her drop the "H"s in the beginning of words, maybe a couple of "Z"s instead of "TH"s, that sort of thing.

One thing that might go a long way, though, and won't mess up the reading, is to remember that Fleur never used contractions. She never says "I'm" or "you're or "it's" or "can't"... it's always "I am," "you are," "it is" and "cannot."
