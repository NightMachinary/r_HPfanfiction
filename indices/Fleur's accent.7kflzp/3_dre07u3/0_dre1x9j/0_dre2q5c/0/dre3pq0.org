True but for me at least showing an accent like Fleur means that you care enough to write the accent down, taking more time with it. I've read stories where the author doesn't even try with Fleur's accent, and it just feels wrong reading a story without some sort of emphasis on her accent. But, maybe that's just me. Plus to me at least it give the story a little more of a personality of sorts.
