I am enjoying it so far, though I have to say that I find reading H/Hr painful most of the time. I just don't think it's really feasible. (There are a few fics where it has worked, but usually it just seems kind of random to me.)

Overall, I'm enjoying it, though. This is more along the lines of what I was looking for, I suppose, despite the pairing. :) Thank you!
