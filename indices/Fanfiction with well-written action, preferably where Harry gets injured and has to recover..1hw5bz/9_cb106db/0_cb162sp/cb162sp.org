Ohhh, I think I've heard of this one!

*Edit:* I have heard of this one, after all! I think I first came accross it when it had just come out and only had a couple of chapters, then I lost track of it. I found where the author has it posted on Fanfiction.net and will add it to my favorites list!

Thanks for your recommendation. This is exactly what I was looking for. The author's characterizations are spot on, IMO, and I love her depiction of Harry and Ginny's relationships and seeing the relationship between Harry and the Potter kids. This author reminds me a lot of *little0bird*, one of my alltime favorite authors in terms of post-DH fanfiction.

Great, thanks!
