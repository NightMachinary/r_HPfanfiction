I tried this one, and I guess I have difficulty picturing Harry as an old man. There are bits that I loved, though. :) Good story over all!

I enjoyed your one shot about Harry and Ginny and the birth of James. I went through your other stories, as well, because why the heck not? :)

Thanks. If you have any authors you would recommend, send 'em my way! I love Harry/Ginny, and you seem like a good writer. Usually good writers know other good writers! :D
