The best canon-like fic I can think of is linkffn(Forging the Sword). linkffn(On The Way to Greatness) is a very believable shift of Harry's canon characterization into what he would be like in Slytherin. I'd also check out linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) and linkffn(What You Leave Behind), both of which really retain the whimsical tone JK conveyed.
