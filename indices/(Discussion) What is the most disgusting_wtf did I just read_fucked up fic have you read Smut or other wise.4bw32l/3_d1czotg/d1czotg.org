There's a lot. One in particular comes to mind, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11381604/1/His-Hidden-Heart]], in which Harry and Luna are pedophiles (sorry, pedo/sexual/, as the author likes to remind us). They go through the motions of taking de-aging potions and having sex with one another. Harry also tutors a first year girl and looks for ways to have sex with her as well.

Sad part is, it's not badly written. I'm not usually bothered by twisted / messed up content in fiction and this is no exception, but I do wish the author used their writing ability (certainly better than average) to create something a little more... engaging.

Edit: Oh, of course, forgot to mention--just like in slash, when you impose a certain sexual attraction on the main character, /everyone/ shares that attraction.
