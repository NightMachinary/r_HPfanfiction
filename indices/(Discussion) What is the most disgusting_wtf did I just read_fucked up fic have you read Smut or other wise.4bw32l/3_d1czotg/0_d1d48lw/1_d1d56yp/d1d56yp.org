It probably was. What sucks is that I'm pretty sure that if it had been handled differently, it could have made for an interesting story. You know, how a messed up sexual attraction can affect the life of an otherwise normal, decent person. It would have no business being HP fanfiction, but it would have made for an interesting read.

Sadly, the author just took the route of "well, magic exists, so let's fuck kids".
