Pretty much anytime a story delves into the seedier sides of magic.

Forcing people to use love potions, polyjucing yourself to have sex with someone who otherwise would never look twice at you, slave bonds etc.

That kind of stuff just doesn't really sit well with me honestly. I almost have to wonder how good the laws are in magical Britain, because I can just imagine how many times someone has gone to the aurors saying "he impregnated me while polyjuiced as my boyfriend" or "bound me as a slave using dark magic".
