ehh in the fandom never read anything that made me go WTF, I liked his hidden heart, paying for his pedestal, and for someone special, spellbook of desires was alright but felt that by making the victims not remember any of it takes a lot of the enjoyment out of the rape aspect. also sequeal is better. In the sherlock fandom I loved "I put away childish things". But in a dojin I read the other week a six year old starts to get abused by her grandfather, things progress he starts violently raping her, BDSM gets introduced, parents go out of town, he ties her up starts to rape her, has heart attack and dies inside her, she's tied up with dead granpa on top of her for next 5 days or so untill parents come back, and this was all in a flashback she has while being gangraped/tortured with 2 other children. first time where afterwards I was like "damn what am I into?" forget which but it was from the grievously wounded girls series.
