I don't remember what it was, but back in the day (like 7 years ago?) it was widely circulated as one of the most disturbing hp fanfictions out there. Something about Ginny getting a birthday present for Harry (or the other way around), someone in a wheelchair, and a piece of hair. That's all I remember.

Anyone know what I'm talking about?
