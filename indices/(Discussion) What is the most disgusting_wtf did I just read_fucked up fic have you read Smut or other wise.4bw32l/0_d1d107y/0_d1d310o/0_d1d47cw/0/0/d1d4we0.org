Yeah, I find that it's best to stay away from those fics. I think there was one fic where Harry is tortured with needles by Death Eaters and Snape adopts him and Draco, but it was actually pretty good despite that not being a very unique story line. (I meant recover from anything, including rape, though like you said it's usually not done very well and there's no actual story.)
