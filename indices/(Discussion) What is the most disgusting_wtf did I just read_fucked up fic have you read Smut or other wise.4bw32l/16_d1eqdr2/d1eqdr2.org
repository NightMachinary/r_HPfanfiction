I can't remember the name, but there was this fic where Harry and Hermione get in a fight after Ron leaves during the Horcrux hunt. Well, the fight turns violent instantly, and it ends with Harry killing Hermione by strangling her with a rope. Now, I was pretty disturbed at this point simply because of the way it was written (no remorse, full of hatred, etc). Unfortunately, it gets more fucked up. Harry decides "wow, Hermione has a nice ass." After he killed her. Harry proceeds to have Necrophiliac sex with Hermione's corpse. Right when he finishes, Ron walks back in, mumbling about changing his mind. Does Ron freak out? Does Ron try to kill Harry for the sight in front of him? No, Ron says he doesn't want Harry's sloppy seconds, and that he'll take Hermione in the ass instead. This was, by far, the most fucked up thing I've read.
