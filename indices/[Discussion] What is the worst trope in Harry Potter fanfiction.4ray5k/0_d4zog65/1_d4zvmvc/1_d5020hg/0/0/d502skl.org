It's a HP/Warcraft crossover and Dumbledore is found out because Harry is accidentally transported to the Warcraft universe. The Tri-Wizard tournament is just an interlude chapter that shows what's happening back on Earth while Harry is raised on Azeroth during the events of Warcraft 3 and the first two expansions of World of Warcraft. It's still a long way off from me actually putting out chapters, I want to get to at least the end of the events in Warcraft 3 which would be the end of the first major story arc.
