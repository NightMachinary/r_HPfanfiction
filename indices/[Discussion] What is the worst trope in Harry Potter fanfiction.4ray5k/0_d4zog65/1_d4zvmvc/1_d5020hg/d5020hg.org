I'm toying with a story where Harry is not at Hogwarts but it's found out when he's around six that the Dursley's were abusive towards him which resulted in Dumbledore losing a good deal of power and being removed as Headmaster of Hogwarts. One of the ripples of this is that the Tri-Wizard tournament gets delayed until what would be Harry's 5th year because McGonagall wants it to be safer and make sure only seventh year students can participate.
