Wasn't the Triwizard Tournament planned independently of Harry's life, though? What I mean is, wouldn't that have happened when it did regardless of what Harry and Voldemort were doing because it was an international thing? I always thought having it happen was okay, just not having it happen the same way. I could totally be wrong, it happens a lot. ;)
