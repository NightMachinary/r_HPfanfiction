Stations of Canon. It's like authors can't use their imagination or have problems with figuring out the consequences of characters actions. Even in some of the most divergent fics there are these things like the same canonical teachers being employed in subsequent years, or Triwizard Tournament occuring in fourth year. Or even Sirius escaping Azkaban. Think about it - without Weasleys winning the contest (which is already based on random chance) /and/ deciding to go on vacation /and/ having a photograph with Scabbers in it /and/ Sirius somehow getting a newspaper to read, it just wouldn't work. Fate is really inelegant answer.
