I enjoy timetravel fics but I honestly don't understand why every single one has to go bsck to Harry and co being 11. Just going back a few months before thend battle of hogwarts would be sufficient, or maybe the Department of Mysteries to save Sirius. I often think about going back to my high school years in real life, but to be 11 again? No thanks. Plus it allow authors to avoid finding ways to prevent squicky preteen sex lives. Speaking of time travel, I really would like to see other characters getting a chance. What would Hagrid do? Amelia Bones (also an annoying trope is Susan's connection to thr DMLE)? Molly Weasly? Ron alone (I know of one unfinished fic that does this)? Fred and George? Dumbledore? Draco? So many possibilities but people only ever focus on a few.

Also, the ones where someone knows tonnes of magic before getting to hogwarts. Accio Trevor comes to mind.

Runes that apparently nobody else seems to have studied oe harry/hermione/someone is such a prodigy that nobody can beat them. Earth Magicks also.
