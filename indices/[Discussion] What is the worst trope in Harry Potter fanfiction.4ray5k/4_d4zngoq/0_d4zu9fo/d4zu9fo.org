Dont forget the 12 family rings that open Griffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw slytherin and peverell and potter and black and merlin and morgana vaults at gringotts that have been mysteriousl sealed for 1000 years because nobody inherited these titles. I often get the feeling authors dont understand how inheritence works. Why wouldnt harry's ancestors have claimed these vaults before??? Occasonally they indicate that Evans brought this through squib lineage but some other relative could easily have claimed it despite a "goblin inheritence test".

Isn't Gringotts a result of the goblin wars that happened waaay after the founding of hogwarts and the lives of the peverells?
