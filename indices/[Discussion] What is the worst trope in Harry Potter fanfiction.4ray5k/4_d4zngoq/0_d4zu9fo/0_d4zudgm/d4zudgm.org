This is going to sound super pretentious and maybe I'm reading into fanfic too much, but I can't stand the gross consumerism of it. Like, is it that necessary for Harry to be so rich and privileged above everyone else? Can't he be special/have power through intelligence and skill rather than luck of birth? It's just mildly depressing that so much emphasis is put on monumental wealth.
