Like post-/OotP/ stories where indy!Harry has worked through Sirius' death and started living a normal-ish life (including dating Ginny) and Ron is Ron and Hermione berates Ginny for "taking advantage" of Harry's alleged emotional state while also berating Harry for "keeping it all bottled up" and not working through his grief?
