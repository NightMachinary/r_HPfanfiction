It happens way too often. The Merging, The Brave New World, Taking Control, hell, even What You Leave Behind kinda has one. Those are perhaps the non-crack fics that have it that don't completely suck that I can remember off the top of my head.

It's really sad, because I like the idea of a wizard having a magical trunk. The storage space makes perfect sense. My personal favorite is the magical trunks in The Well-Groomed Mind, in which it is something each individual wizard creates for himself. The design Harry starts working on actually doesn't have giant chambers in it, so he won't ever get trapped a la Moody.

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin actually has a bedroom trunk that Harry buys, but he notes that it reminds him of the cupboard so he'll probably never use it.
