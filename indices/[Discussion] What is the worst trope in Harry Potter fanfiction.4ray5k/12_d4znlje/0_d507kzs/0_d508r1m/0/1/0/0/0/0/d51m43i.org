/shrug/ it's semantics then, I still think the phrasing is rude, but with nothing but text to look at it's impossible to tell. Me, personally, I would have said "Yeah, but /remember/ the third book?" but I can't exactly critique you for not saying exactly what I would have.

TL;DR: Got moody about semantics, Jesus fuck I need to calm myself.
