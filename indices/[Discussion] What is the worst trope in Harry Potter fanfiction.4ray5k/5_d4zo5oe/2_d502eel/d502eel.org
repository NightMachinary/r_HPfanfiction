I really don't like fics where Dumbledore actually says the words "for the greater good". That was Grindlewald's well-known call to arms, and for Dumbledore to be saying the same thing would be a major alarm bell for anyone else in the room.

I don't care if he actually /is/ GreaterGood!Dumbledore -- that can be interesting -- he just can't be so clueless as to actually say the words in front of people.
