So I have two. The first is possibly the most trivial and pedantic, regarding an overused line, and its canonical so disregard as bitching if you'd like. It irritates me to no end when a female character (generally the LI) chastises one of the boys for language. "Language Harry/Ron!" Not their damn mum woman.

Second is by far more irritating (In my less than humble opinion. When a character tells Harry to basically suck it up, stop moping, or quit being a punk. I get that no one likes too much angst but lets be real. (As real as we can be when discussing fiction.) Harry is a teenager. Teenagers are angsty. And the ones who weren't are liars. And I'd say Harry has more reasons to be angsty or whiny or whatever than virtually any other character except maybe Neville. Orphan, chased by a psychopath, mistreated by a teacher for frankly childish reasons, publicly reviled/canonized, raped by a house elf(I may be remembering that part), abusive relatives(another irritating trope when authors with no concept of abuse fail miserably to make it convincing).\\
My overly long point is, it's annoying when the author presents the angst then just has stock character #5 give him a monologue about why he doesn't have it so bad and he should be proactive. It usually leads to the grossly over powered indy harry. It's ham fisted, and just poor character evolution.

Also long author notes. Fuck long author notes. It's a story not your personal podium. Thats what forums are for.
