Harry befriending Hermione. I don't think a Death Eater Harry would befriend a muggle born.

To clarify, I mean how most fics wind up having Harry befriend Hermione, even if he comes from a vastly different background. I've seen fics where he is the heir to Voldemort, but he still becomes best pals with Hermione.
