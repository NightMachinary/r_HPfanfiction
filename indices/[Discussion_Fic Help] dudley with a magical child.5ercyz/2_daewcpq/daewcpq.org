I'd rather see them both together as a reader, if you can do it without repeating too much information. Like if there's a phone conversation between Dudley and Harry not showing the whole thing from both POV's or re-quoting large swaths of every single chapter just to get the other person's emotions about each line. If you feel you need to do that, by all means make two stories.

But people do write changing POV stories all the time so it should totally be possible.
