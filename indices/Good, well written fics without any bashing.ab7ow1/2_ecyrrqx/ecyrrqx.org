It's actually a challenge to find fics with no bashing so these don't quite meet all of your requirements of starting in first year.

​

Great Dumbledore mentor fic with a frankly original point of divergence in fourth year linkffn(12648415)

​

This is delightfully fun. Does a fantastic job of avoiding stations of canon as Harry pretty much ignores everything he's not interested in. Starts in first year. linkffn(12703694)

​

Features smart, lucky, goofball Ravenclaw Harry. Starts in first year. linkao3(2337458)

​

Post-war reconstruction fic with an emphasis on healing divisions between people linkffn(13022013)

​

A Sirius becomes Lord Black to take custody of Harry fic. Dumbledore is canon level manipulative, but the fic is careful to skate by the usual bashing cliches. linkao3(1085412)
