linkffn(The Legacy by storytellerspw; The Mind Arts; Eclipse of the Sky; Mistakes and Second Chances; Grow young with me)

In Mistakes, it may look like Dumbledore-Bash, but there's a reason, and it tones down 100% later on. It also doesn't have the Trio, because of reasons, but there is Hermione as main friend. Even though GYWM is post-war, its one of the best trio feelsgoodman friendships imo. Mind Arts also has no trio, even if he befriends Hermione for awhile. It does have indepth magics and explores the magical community and lore.

Eclipse is simply fantastic, one of my favourite Ron's, a great Hermione that actually feels like that canon part where she's a daredevil (she lured Umbridge to be gangbanged by centaurs and a giant). The OC is wonderful imo, def not a mary-sue and the romance part is delightful. For me at least.

The Legacy is imo, the best contract fic there is, with a completely unique Daphne, a Trio that each has a specialty and are fairly cohesive.

I would recommend a few more but they were posted already.
