It sounds interesting. I was hoping more Harry and his friends gradually getting stronger and navigating the mess that is the Wizarding World. But I'll give this a try. As soon as I finish reading all the ones I've opened up in fifteen tabs of my browser. Also, Harry raised by decent muggles and having the common sense most wizards lack would be welcome too.
