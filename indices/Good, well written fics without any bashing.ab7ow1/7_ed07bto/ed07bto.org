To make a link, put the display text in [square brackets], then put the URL afterward in (round brackets).

Also, this subreddit has a helpful bot for linking and summarising stories; you can see examples in the other comments. It's pretty good at guessing the story from just an approximate title, but you can also add "by Joe Bloggs" to narrow it down, or just use the story ID, or the full URL to the story.
