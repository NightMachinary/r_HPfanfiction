As nice as that would be to see, too many people associate working hard with a great future. Plus, that's the core of Hermione's personality, being the well-read no-nonsense chick. Take that away from her and the negative parts of her personality (being bossy, overbearing and overstepping boundaries) will completely overweigh any positives (her loyalty and caring nature). If everyone can fuck around and get good grades and have a good future then Hermione goes from "Well she's annoying but at least she's smart" to "Who cares if she's smart, she's annoying af".

Even in canon, Bill, Charlie and Tonks were said to be popular to some extent and cool. They worked hard, sure, but that's not all they did. I'm sure there are others in the Trio's age range that are the same but don't get featured for obvious reasons (well, except maybe the twins).
