I mean you do have very smart people who did like do other things.

Like the Marauders were all very smart good grades did impressive shit with magic not even Hermione did in school so it not like there isn't precedent. I mean Hermione does have a character beyond being smart and she should. I think it a good idea to grow her character in fandom beyond just being the smart one. And i think removing the "smart one" characterization from her does help with that.
