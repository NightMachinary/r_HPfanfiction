  Like the Marauders were all very smart good grades did impressive shit with magic not even Hermione did in school so it not like there isn't precedent.

There is, but if there's a popular kid that's as smart as Hermione and less annoying, she becomes superfluous to an extent.

  I mean Hermione does have a character beyond being smart and she should.

Which, imo, is mostly negative. She, JKR and fanfic writers really clutch that "know-it-all" ball. She freaked out when Harry was doing better than her in 6th year and her role is basically exposition.

#+begin_quote
  removing the "smart one" characterization from her does help with that.

What will it be replaced with?
