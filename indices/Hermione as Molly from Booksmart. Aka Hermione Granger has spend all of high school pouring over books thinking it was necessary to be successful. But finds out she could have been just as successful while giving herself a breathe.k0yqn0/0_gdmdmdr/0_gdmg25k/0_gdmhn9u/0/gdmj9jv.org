Ok so for example Hermione in book 6 can feel insecure because deep down she feels like the replaceable friend who people liked because she was smart. If her smartness is irrelevant people won't like her and want to be her friend . And now her freaking out becomes sympathetic. Seeing people still want to be friends with her despite her smarts not always being necessary feels kinda compelling.

As for non intelligence aspects of Hermione for example:

Hermione cares alot about people who are left behind by society.

She's the one who found out about Lupins secret and avoided telling people so he wouldn't deal with the stigma. She is most furious when Rita writes that article about Hagrid. She was the one who did all that work trying to prevent Buckbeaks execution. She was the one invested the house elf situation. She cares very deeply about injustices she sees. There are alot of potential things you can do with this aspect of her that's not tied to her being the smart one.

And I do think they come out more if she's not always the smart one. If there are a bunch of other smart characters around her like there is for Molly in Booksmart then other defining qualities around her get to shine. And those will be the things most compelling about her. But they are also the qualities that will more likely be overlooked if she is defined as the smart one. It wouldn't be fair if others got defined based on personality traits while she gets defined by what she can provide. Plus it allows others to be smart too and that can be interesting especially if its characters you are less used to seeing as smart even if they are.

Working hard is necessary for a good future but if you watch the scene you realize that it wasn't as if these other characters never worked hard at studying.

In the scene

Molly is confused she says but you guys don't care about studying.

To which the reply is no we just don't only care about studying.

These other interests hobbies and passions are necessary to be a well rounded person. And being well rounded is necessary in life.

Its also pretty true in life. In my experience most of the smartest kids in school did have other hobbies and passions outside of studies. And I mean smartest gpa and standardized test score wise. The ones who ended up in the prestigious colleges. That's maybe easy to say in highschool since extracurriculars are necessary for college. But that continued to be true in college.

In fact those who only studied seemed to struggle more not because they weren't smart but because they had more difficulty with the stress.

At least in my experience.
