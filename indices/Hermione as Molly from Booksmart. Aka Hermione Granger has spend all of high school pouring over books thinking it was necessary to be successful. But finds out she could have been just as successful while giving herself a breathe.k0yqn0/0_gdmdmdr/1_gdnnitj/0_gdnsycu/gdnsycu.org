I mean as much as Hermione reading alot is useful to them I don't think it's her most useful skill. Yes she a nerd that reads alot of things. But she's probably not the only nerd reads alot of things. There are probably a ton in school who read alot for the same reasons she does.

Her skill imo is being logical figuring shit out like Snapes logic puzzle in book one. And discovering Rita Skeeter's animagus in book 4. She is the only one to apply Snapes lesson to irl and figure out Lupin is a werewolf. Thats where she excels and yes its intelligence but its a specific kind thats useful in specific situations.

She not the big picture strategy person. That's Ron which is why he is the one who immediately sees why knocking out the Troll is a bad idea in book 7 while Hermione doesn't.

Its not understanding people either which is why she struggles to help the Houseelves. Not because her goal is wrong but she goes about it the wrong way. Its why Harry is the one to understand what the hell Dumbledore wants them to do in book 3 before Hermione.

Its also why magic thats not purely logical like the patronus or divination doesnt come as easily to her ( also possibly defense against the dark arts its hard to say since you dont know enough about the subject but Harry does better at magic you have to understand in different ways not just logically and he does better in Defense than her. The dark arts also seem to have a emotional aspect to them or at least the unforgivables do and my bet is Harry would be better at casting them). She gets better over time at understanding people but it's not where she shines.

And as you saw in those examples Hermiones brand of intelligence isn't always the relevant one. To be fair the others having intelligence or knowledge didn't feel threatening to her before book 6. It wasn't as if she saw Harry flying and got mad he excelled in a type of magic she couldn't. And in book 5 she's the one who goes to him to teach DADA. She acknowledges he's better than her and doesn't have a meltdown over it. So you could say book 6 was ooc.

But you could argue maybe her skills were usually important and useful in books 1-5 before this point and if there were more situations where they weren't shed have reacted similarly. Its not intelligence persay but insecurity about not feeling useful. The book you could argue is more directly challenging her skills in a way the others don't. Since another 16 year old ( since Snape was 16 when he wrote in it) logicked out a better way to do the potion with the same available information. It was just specifically in potions but still.

In which case she still has to learn the lesson that she is more than the smart one she deserves to be their friend even when her skillset isn't the one being useful. Or someone ( or in this case something) is equally as useful as her in the area she excels in. Which could be interesting growth for her.

Hermione as I pointed out was not smart in the way Harry and Ron were. She also was not an inventor the way Fred and George were. She was always smart in a very specific way. So it very honestly makes sense to not give her the smart one designation. Because she isn't the only smart one.

But that doesn't mean she's not smart. Removing that designation isn't about diminishing her in anyway but about acknowledging the intelligence of the rest. And making plot points in stories that let you acknowledge and celebrate that intelligence.

Which then also allows Hermione's charscter more free to explore more aspects than just the intelligence part. Which ties into the her realizing she didn't always have to be grinding like that to be successful and useful and prompts her to try to do other things. Things that aren't necessarily connected to her being smart.
