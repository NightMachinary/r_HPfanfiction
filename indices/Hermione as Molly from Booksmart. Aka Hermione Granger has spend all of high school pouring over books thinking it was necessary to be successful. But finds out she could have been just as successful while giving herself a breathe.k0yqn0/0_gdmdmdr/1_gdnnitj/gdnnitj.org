Well, part of what makes stories compelling is character development, and for Hermione to realise that memorising all the useless trivia or spending inordinate amounts of time over books is not end-all-be-all would be a good piece of it.

You don't need to have her suddenly become stupid, or have others outshine her on pure knowledge, but there are already pieces in the books that kinda pick up on the theme - i.e. the devil's snare scene.

And there are ways to pick up her development from there - i.e. have her devlop some focus instead of simply soaking everything for little gain, find some other hobby than studying (i.e. trying to do fun shit with magic), that sort of stuff.
