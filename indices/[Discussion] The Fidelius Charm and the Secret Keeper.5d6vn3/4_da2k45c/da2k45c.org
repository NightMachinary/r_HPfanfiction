Maybe its because the Potters might have needed a visitor like a nurse or someone to visit without endangering themselves. An external secret keeper can bring guests without the Potters exposing themselves. Mr Weasley however regularly has to leave the Burrow so can spread the secret when needed. Maybe it deteriorates when the secret keeper is in the location for a long time thus Dumbledore not Sirius was secret keeper of No.12 Mr Weasley working each day is enough downtime I guess.
