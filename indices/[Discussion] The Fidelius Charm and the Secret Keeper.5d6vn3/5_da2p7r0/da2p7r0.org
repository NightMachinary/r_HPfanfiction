I like to believe that after the tragic events of Halloween '81, Dumbledore set to modifying the charm so that the secret can be contained within itself (i.e. the secret keeper can reside within the area protected by the Fidelius). I believe it's safe to assume he succeeded in this endeavour pre-OTTP as the Fidelius on Grimmauld Place would fail after his death. Either that or the "multiple secret keepers" thing from the death of the original secret keeper creates a loophole for it
