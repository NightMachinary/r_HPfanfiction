The only reason the Fidelius worked like that for the Weasleys is because they did not own the property. In the movies at least, Aunt Muriel owned Shell Cottage, which is why the Weasleys could be each others secret keeper. In the books, it is never actually said that Bill and Fleur even owned Shell Cottage so Muriel being the one who legally own the place wouldn't contradict canon.

James and Lily couldn't be each other's secret keeper because they were the owners of their house. It would only work if they made their secret keeper someone who wasn't already living there. The only way James and Lily could have been each other's Secret Keeper is if they had been living in someone else's house, and that person wasn't living there despite owning the place. The only place that really fits the bill would be where ever Lupin lives (does Lupin even HAVE his own home?). Grimmauld Place wouldn't work since the entire Order have been there already and know about it. However if Lupin went off to live with Wormtail while James and Lily were living in Lupin's home as the secret keepers, it could have protected them.

Besides, there is always the possibility that the Fidelius Charm was developed even more following the death of James and Lily. We know this type of thing is possible because Dumbledore developed the Patronus Charm even further so that it could be used to deliver messages. That wasn't a thing because Dumbledore came up with it.

Either way, its not really a plothole because it can be interpreted that Bill and Fleur only lived at Shell Cottage but didn't actually own it legally (i.e. they were living at Muriel's place while Muriel was hiding in another place). The only way it would be a plot hole is if it was outright stated that Shell Cottage was Bill and Fleur's actual house.
