Maybe it's because the fidelius charm was developed further in the following two decades. People would try to improve such an important charm, especially as the the faults in it were so widely seen in the attack on the Potters. How many people 'know' that Sirius betrayed the Potters? How many of those know the fidelius charm was in use? How many of those would have liked a safer version?
