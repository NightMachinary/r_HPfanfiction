Well, is there WoG that she didn't? I mean Arthur is such a non-personality in the books (he's the whipped man of the overbearing (and lazy, because with magic you can do chores in minutes and there's no excuse to stay at home when all your kids are at school and your family is poor!) Molly Weasley who he hides from in the shed to tinker with muggle items!)...so it might very well be true :(

ps: Yes, I am biased because I frankly don't like Molly!
