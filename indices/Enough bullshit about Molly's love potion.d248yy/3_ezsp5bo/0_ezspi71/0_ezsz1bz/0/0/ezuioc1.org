I mean, quite a lot of human activity is nudges to make people more likely to date you. Like wearing a nice shirt or going to the gym. I don't think it's reasonable to say you raped someone if they wouldn't have slept with you if you had made a bad first impression, and I think (hope) that most love potions are more on that level
