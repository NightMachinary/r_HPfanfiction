I remember about twelve years ago I read a romance fic of her and Arthur getting together that started off with her trying to dose someone for a prank or something, and accidentally copping Arthur with it instead. Hijinks ensue, and after she gets him to drink an antidote they end up dating.

Thought that was a good way to disarm something that JKR tossed in there in her characteristic blithe fashion.
