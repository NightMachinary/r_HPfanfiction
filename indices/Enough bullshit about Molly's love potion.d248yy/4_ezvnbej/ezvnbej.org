Not only Molly did brew a love potion, but Arthur is addicted!

​

"Molly, I want the good stuff!"

​

Molly knew better than to think by " good stuff" her husband meant what was between her legs. /Well, I suppose it is my fault./

"Try not to snort it all, will you?" She had quickly discovered the powdered version of her modified love potion offered the best results: it was scentless, tasteless and by snorting the powder, Arthur´s kidneys were not as affected.

"Molly, my little Potions Queen! You did it again! " Arthur smiled maniacally at her as he snorted more and more of the pink powder. " You gotta start brewing for Harry- our Ginny needs those galleons!"

Molly sighed. How could she have known that reading those stupid books would turn Ginevra into such an obsessed fangirl? /Well, I guess it is my fault also- I made my bed, as they say./ " I had hoped Ginevra would not need my help, Arthur."

Truth be told, she also did not need to poison Arthur at all. They were going steady and surely, he would have proposed. But Molly badly wanted to lose her virginity in a broom closet and Arthur had wanted to wait until they were married.

So, she created a potion to allow Arthur to overcome his inhibitions so that her lust would be sated

She fell pregnant with Bill on her first time- probably, another side effect of her potion.

"The girl needs all our help- this could very well be our ticket out of this shithole!" Arthur earned well enough to support their family in relative luxury, but his addiction meant that great part of his paycheck would end up at Knockturn Alley...

Molly nodded. /Oh my, I will have to go myself- poor Errol found my secret stash again!/ " Should I also brew for Ron?"

Arthur considered: " Why not? I hear dentists are pretty rich...that Granger girl must be loaded!"
