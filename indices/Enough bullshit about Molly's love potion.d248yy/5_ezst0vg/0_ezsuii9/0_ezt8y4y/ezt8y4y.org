Apart from her whole story about making it at least. So we know that she at the least intended to use such a thing. Buying, or making a "rape drug" is pretty damn bad in, and of itself. While we don't know what happened, we know what was intended to happen, and crimes are always about intent. Almost killing someone, and almost murdering someone are two very different things, one was an accident, or unintentional, the other was premeditated, and *intentional*.

So while we have no proof, we at least know that she had intent, and what she intended to do was quite horrible.
