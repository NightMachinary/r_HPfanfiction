*And now,*\\
*PRESENTING*\\

/A series of brief snippets that illustrate the course of a Harry Potter/Skyrim crossover./

/Harry is hit by Voldemort's killing curse, and wakes up in a strange cart with Ralof, Lokir, and Ulfric./\\
Ralof: "You're finally awake."\\
/Harry assesses the situation./\\
Harry: "What the bloody hell is going on?"

/The cart arrives in Helgen./\\
Hadvar: "Captain, what the bloody hell is going on? You can't seriously propose to execute a child!"\\
Captain: "He's old enough to be a Stormcloak. Get him to the block."\\
Harry: "Not again."

/About three minutes later, in Sovngarde./\\
Tsun: "Another soul who-wait, you don't look very old. And your favoured weapon is that tiny stick? What the bloody hell is going on?"

/And immediately following the subsequent 'warrior's test'./\\
Tsun: "I would like to reiterate my previous inquiry. That's no use of the Voice that I've ever encountered before."\\
Harry: "I still don't know what the bloody hell is going on."

/Then in the Hall of Valor./\\
Jurgen: "So in summary, you come from a completely different world, and know absolutely nothing about Nirn, the Aedra, Daedra, and so forth?"\\
Harry: "Essentially."\\
Jurgen: "Well then, I might be two millenia out of date, but I shall do my best to enlighten you as to what the bloody hell is going on."

/A fair while later./\\
Jurgen: "Oh, now what the bloody hell is going on?"\\
Harry: "I'm catching that phrase a lot..."\\
Jurgen: "I can't believe my calculations are correct, but if they are...this 'Voldemort', when he took your blood to rebuild his body, your blood flows, 'your' flesh lives, in some impossible way, you still live!"

/And then./\\
Tsun: "NAHL DAAL VUS!"\\
/Ladies & gentlemen, Harry Potter has left the building./\\
Jurgen: "Err...did that send him back to his homeworld, or to Nirn?"\\
Tsun: "Oops."

Valga: "What do you need, mysterious stranger who appeared out of thin air?"\\
Harry: "I think this is the part where I ask about rumours?"\\
Valga: "Aside from the ones about you? Everyone's talking about what happened in Helgen. The Imperials executed Ulfric Stormcloak, but they killed a teenager too, about your age, just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time."\\
Harry: "I saw it, actually. General Tullius was there, he did nothing to stop it."\\
Valga: "Really? Imperials slaughtering teens, I don't know what the bloody hell is going on with the Empire these days. Galmar Stone-Fist is raising an uproar about it, and I've heard that Jarl Balgruuf is thinking about changing sides..."
