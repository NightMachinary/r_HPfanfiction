You might want to try Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(11191235). Both Harry and James Jr. (Harry's twin brother) are competent there, without crossing over reasonable skill level. Of course we are still at the holidays between second and third year, so many things can change yet, but considering that author focus on trickery and clever use of skills as a way of solving problems, we probably shouldn't worry.
