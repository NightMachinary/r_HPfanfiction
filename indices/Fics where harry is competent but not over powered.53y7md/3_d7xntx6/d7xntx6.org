I'll never get sick of recommending that. One of my all time favorite fics and it actually got an update last month after a year long hiatus.

Harry is working hard for his progress and he doesn't just turn into Voldemort's equal over night. There's one specific scene that was very well written and shows what kind of fic this is perfectly.

Very Minor Spoiler: [[/spoiler][Harry duels Bella in the Ministry atrium scene while Dumbledore fights Tom. Harry can go up against Bella after months of training but watching Dumbledore and Voldemort fight is still on a whole other level.]]
