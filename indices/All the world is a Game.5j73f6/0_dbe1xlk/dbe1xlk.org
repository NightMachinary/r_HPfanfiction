I'm still unhappy with the number of passages you've copied from HPMOR. It makes me wonder how much of the rest of the story is your original work, or just copied and I'm not recognizing the sources. There have been a few fanfictions where groups of students would go through Lockhart's books looking for discrepencies and factual errors---I wonder how many copied passages people could find in your story (I've got 5, but I stopped reading at ch. 10).

At least you finally credited Rowling for that article you copied in its entirety from Pottermore (even though it really adds nothing to your story that you couldn't have achieved by simply summarizing the concepts in a few sentences of your own creation, or you could simply remove it and leave the later reference as an easter egg for those who have read the article).
