I don't think I've ever seen this done before and I'm not sure why, because it's such an obvious point of divergence and it has the potential for some really interesting butterflies.

Even if Riddle just fucks off somewhere for a while to resurrect himself Harry's first year is gonna be really different. Even if Quirrell survives splitting with Riddle's spirit (which doesn't seem too terribly unlikely with way less time together, not having drank a bunch of unicorn blood and the Philosopher's Stone* to work with) I somehow doubt he'll be getting back to Hogwarts on time, if at all.

Meanwhile, all the adults are gonna be frantically scrambling around at the start of Harry's first term. If Dumbledore plays things right the Ministry will probably be going nuts looking for the Stone too, for the threat a thief with access to unlimited gold poses to the economy if nothing else. Combined with whatever it was that delayed Hagrid Harry could easily end up in a different house. Even if he ends up in Gryffindor again things will still be pretty different, with Dumbledore and all the teachers in a tizzy and no professor for DADA (or whatever replacement Dumbledore is able to scrape up before the start of term in his /copious/ spare time not dealing with the crisis a potentially reborn Voldemort represents). There will be no obstacle course on the third floor (and the cerberus will probably be out of the castle too, I can't see Hagrid letting one of his babies languish inside for a year when there's not even anything for it to guard), no troll on Halloween to bond with Hermione over, no one to give Hagrid a dragon or curse Harry's broom if he still ends up playing Quidditch, etc, etc, etc...

On a personal level, assuming Voldemort isn't too quick to figure out how to create a new body for himself and doesn't immediately make a huge scene once he does, I figure Harry will probably have a fairly boring first year (though there's always the potential for personal drama in there and Hogwarts has plenty of good adventures to get into). On the other hand, Harry does like to pry into things, he's probably going to notice that there's some dark currents moving in the background, unsettling stories in the newspapers, teachers acting nervous well after the initial commotion dies down, students with relevant familial connections getting strange letters from home, things like that. Hagrid will probably be a total wreck over 'failing' Dumbledore like that too, and may well let slip just who the prime suspect for stealing the stone was (and what he could be doing with it).

The good guys are going to be in a much worse place for dealing with Voldemort's return at this point in the timeline too. Harry's much younger and less seasoned, Dumbledore still only has suspicions about how Riddle survived, and no proof. The Diary is still safely hidden at Malfoy manor, Sirius Black is still in prison... things could get pretty bad.

On the other hand, depending on how his Sorting and his First Year go, that sort of thing happening in the background might motivate Harry to take his education and training a lot more seriously, in order to prepare for the conflict he knows is coming.

*It's pretty common in fanfics for the Stone to be a decoy/trap created by Dumbledore and/or The Flammels, but I'm assuming it's the real deal here because that seems more in the spirit of this prompt, and is probably more interesting anyway.
