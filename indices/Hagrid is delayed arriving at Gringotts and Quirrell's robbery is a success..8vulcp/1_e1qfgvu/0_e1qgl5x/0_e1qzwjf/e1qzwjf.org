Thanks, I couldn't remember off hand if it was earlier that day, or just the day prior that the vault had been emptied. Since Quirrell made his move later that day, it could be down to maintenance on the underground that day or something else causing Hagrid and Harry to get there later. Pretty simple to cause a delay.

If that's the case, then Harry wouldn't have seen Quirrell, unless he saw him on the way out, after the theft, instead of (presumably) on the way in like we saw him in canon.

Two ways I see this playing out.

First is if the theft is discovered before Harry and Hagrid make it into Gringotts, which I presume would lead to the bank closing, as they look for the perp. Upside, it lets you keep the plot fairly similar a little longer. Downside, is there's less initial drama.

The second, and better dramatically imo, is if Harry and Hagrid discover that the vault is empty. If I remember correctly, they went to Harry's vault then the vault with the stone. In that case Harry would have money, but no supplies when the massive man that's minding him starts loosing his mind, the goblins start loosing their minds, and presumably close everything down, harsh accusations are being thrown both ways, Dumbledore gets involved, as does Flammel... And there's Harry, sitting there, thoroughly confused, but knowing more than he has any right to, because everyone was talking over his head.

A possible option is that Quirrell, content that he got away clean, has a drink at the pub, and is pulled in because he's a Hogwarts professor, and /presumably/ is an expert in his given field. Let him use the "If I were doing it, I'd do it this way instead" defense, and lets us see more competence from him than the "p-poor st-stuttering Qu-Quirrell" that we got in canon.
