You know, this does go a bit too far but something like this should have been implemented after the first blood war. The muggleborn extermination commission is more disturbing than this and was a direct result of no one even addressing the death eater / Slytherin philosophy. (Yes, Slytherin. Their password is "pureblood". The basilisk targets muggleborns. I agree it's stupid but canonically Slytherin is just evil house)
