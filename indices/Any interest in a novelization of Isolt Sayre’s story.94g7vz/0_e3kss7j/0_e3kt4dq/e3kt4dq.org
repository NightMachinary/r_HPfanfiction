I am interested. It's been a very enjoyable read after somewhat forgetting about it. I mostly ask since I typically spend my time writing original fiction. This is my first foray into writing fan fiction in fact, and I'm curious if the premise appeals to the community. I will continue working on it, but if there is interest, I intend to set aside more time for it than I would otherwise.
