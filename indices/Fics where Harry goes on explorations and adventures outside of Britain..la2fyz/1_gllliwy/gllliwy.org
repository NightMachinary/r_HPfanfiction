A significant part of Midnight Blues takes place outside Britain, and it's really entertaining. It has a classic spy movie vibe that I really like.

Magicks of the Arcane starts off in Harry's fourth year, but it still has Harry and Dumbledore having a few adventures in Egypt, China, Carribean Islands(?) and a few other places I can't remember.

Kicking Gotham and it's sequel, Toppling Heroes, fit the bill too. DC crossover that isn't a bad smut-fic.
