I've written "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis", where Harry, Hermione and Ron are Cuerse-Breakers travelling the world searching for Atlantis. And dealing with lots of trouble on the way. In no particular order they visit North Africa, Turkey, the Caribbean, South America and North America.
