Harry Potter and the Cursed Summer itself takes place almost entirely outside of Britain as he basically interns for Bill Weasley for the summer. Its sequel is incomplete and hasn't been updated in awhile, but this one is complete.

This other one might not be what you're looking for, but it certainly happens outside Britain for the most part so far. It's also currently being updated. Dragon Chronicles 2: Harry Potter, Dragon Whisperer. This particular story has Harry basically apprenticed to to Charlie Weasley this time. However, this comes as the sequel to an AU where the Dursleys rejected the Hogwarts offer instead of ignoring it, and Harry is only dragged into the Magical World for the Triwizard Tournament.
