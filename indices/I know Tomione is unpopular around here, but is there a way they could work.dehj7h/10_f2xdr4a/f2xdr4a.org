If you subscribe to the idea that Tom is a psychopath -- not really.

However, if you believe he's simply a victim of his upbringing -- then yes, but you need to nudge his timeline in a different direction /very early/ in his childhoold (and I'm talking when he's like 6 years old at latest). Compare with Draco (needs to have Lucius' influence removed, but would probably work fine if done around 11-13 years old) and Severus (who I'm pretty sure lived on a thin line for a rather long period until he eventually fell in completely with the Death Eaters and whose timeline only needs minor nudging).
