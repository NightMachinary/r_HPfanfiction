You need to start (IMO) with reducing the age difference - that can be done with time travel on either part, or with the diary.

Then you need a believable way to bridge the gap between their canon personalities and worldview - so that, IMO, has to be there before Tom/Voldemort becomes 100% obsessed with his pureblood rhetoric and all.

To me, what seems most 'likely' to set it up would be with the diary. Tom is young in that one, and setting him up to be less terrible would not be that hard - nor would including some type of magical effect involved (eg, making Hermione bring him to 'life' in a way that changes him to a degree).

I suspect one way to expand the relationship in a believable way would be to work from the fact that they're both brilliant - and in Tom's case, that Hermione would presumably be his first challenging rival in classes, if not with his outside abilities. That can be the start of a twist in his pureblooded supremacy, which again is necessary to make the relationship believable.
