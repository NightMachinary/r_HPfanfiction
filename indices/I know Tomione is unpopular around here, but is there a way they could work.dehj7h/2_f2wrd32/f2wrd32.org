I could /sort of/ see it if he were reincarnated or possessing a body of a suitable age, where he dates her as a cover and/or to get closer to Harry. Then it would go from emotionless manipulation while appearing to be very social and bright - something Tom was very good at in canon - to actually developing feelings. Kind of like Dumbledore's plans for Harry, where he promised himself he wouldn't get too attached to do what he needed to, then failed and valued Harry's life more than countless others.

There are repeated hints in canon that Voldemort doesn't actually follow pureblood supremacism on its own merits, but because it's close enough to his own goals of maintaining power that he goes along with it to keep his followers loyal. For instance, Dumbledore notes that, when given the chance, he marks Harry, not Neville, as his rival. A halfblood, not a pureblood. I could see him eventually valuing a Muggleborn on her own merits.
