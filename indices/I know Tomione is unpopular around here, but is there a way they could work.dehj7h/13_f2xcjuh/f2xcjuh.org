Definitely one of the more interesting pairings that is hard to get to work.

The best I've read so far is linkffn(She Rises). It's time travel where a battle-hardened Hermione that has killed and has been tortured extensively--basically dark/grey but still good Hermione--gets thrown back in time. I especially like this fic because she's not trying to redeem Tom (He already has multiple horcruxes and she's aware, though cautions him to not create more. She has no qualms torturing and killing either.). It's not exactly time-travel, but rather Dimension travels with a time difference--meaning that more and more characters will (and already have) follow after Hermione--and the whole thing will (hopefully) eventually come to a four-way war: Tom/Hermione vs Voldemort vs Harry/Dumbledore vs Grindelwald.

That being said, the fic is /very/ slow (with too much focus on the pairing) and this is just me theorizing. I think to put the premise like that, it's pretty awesome, and I can only hope that the author will make it happen.

Other than that, having Tom resurrect from the diary (not in second year, as to avoid an age difference) can work too. Of course, you'd have to come up with a reasonable explanation for it. Maybe Hermione had the diary all the time, but Tom didn't manage (or chose not) to possess her. Along the years Hermione becomes more ruthless and whatnot, while Tom begins to value her and reevaluates his believes of blood purity, etc. Either they come up with a different approach to resurrect him or Hermione tricks a death eater into writing in the diary and Tom uses them to get himself a body. Then he joins the Golden Trio to fight Voldemort, they win, he/she becomes minister of magic, and whatnot--the usual.

That's just one of many ways to make it happen. Still I agree that having canon Hermione paired up with him is unrealistic. I think most stories have the problem with redeeming Tom without giving another (bigger) baddie to fight, and thus the story has no real direction anymore.

Anyway, those are my thoughts. I'm definitely a fan of the pairing, but it's rare that it's done well.
