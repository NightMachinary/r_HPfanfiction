Well, Tom is 50+ years older than Hermione, so it wouldn't unless there was time travel shenanigans going on. In any canon universe, they would never be a thing, just like Harry and Tom Riddle would never happen.

People ship Tom Riddle and Hermione because they're both academically talented, ruthless at times, ambitious, and hypocritical whenever it suits them. Also because the casting directors for the movies chose hot actors, and hot people banging is hot.
