I actually haven't read that far but I thought the idea of how it did try to keep more or less to the first books (minus the epilogue) was unique. You might prefer darker Tomione, which definitely exist, not everyone's cup of tea though. I'm a bit more lax because I mostly read for just enjoyment/escapism and it's my guilty pleasure ship. Also I read Cursed Child and if that can be stamped with approval with its OOC then I'm okay with a little here and there.
