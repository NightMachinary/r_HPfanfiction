  if you are looking for one that tries to fit into canon I'd recommend checking out Unsphere the Stars.

I dropped that fic because of how OOC it was. The prose was pretty and it had some interesting wordbuilding ideas, but it leaned hard into Super Hermione, and the way it interpreted horcruxes was silly and stretched artistic license right outside any possibility of being canon. The most recent chapter made me wish the fic had finished at the end of their Hogwarts years.

  "Are you Lord Voldemort?"

  "I could have been but I am not."

  "Are you sorry?"

  "Desperately."

I'm sorry, but this was ridiculous and Tom Riddle, before he murdered people and ripped up his soul, was a nasty little brat with no moral center or sense of remorse. He didn't have to be a racist, terrorist, or murderer, but no amount of soul-fixing would fix his moral compass, because he never had one in the first place.
