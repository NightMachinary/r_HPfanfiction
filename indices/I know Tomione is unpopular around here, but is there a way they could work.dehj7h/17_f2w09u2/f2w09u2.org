It is fanfiction so there's a lot of stories written that can make this work; I mean if Dobby/Hagrid can be paired why not right?

The most common setup is some sort time travel puts Hermione in school with Tom, where they become academic rivals or you get the whole scenario of Hermione standing up to and not taking any of his bullshit. Her intelligence and talent usually piques his interest and then he finds her an asset. Obviously there's a little bit of loose play with his stance on Muggleborns, she either becomes an exception to his rule because her power is more coveted than his beliefs or authors play with the idea that his whole stance is more of a political play in order to manipulate his way to power. They are both brilliant and seekers of knowledge, so they have common interests. Let's face it Hermione is not a white characters, she's most definitely grey. She's not necessarily opposed to dark, I mean she's brewing Polyjuice out of a restricted book 2nd year, they constantly break rules, she scars Marietta, leaves Umbridge to the whims of the Centaurs, etc etc.

There's also a ton of AUs that present them with their character traits but don't necessarily set them up in canonical universe; i.e. they are born in same era, muggle AUs, etc. In any case I personally love this ship even though it's a bit ridiculous when you try and canonically break it down. It allows for a lot of the whole Light/Dark dynamics and power plays, academic rivalries, ideas of redemption (yeah, yeah maybe fictional but why can't we hope/dream?), and love the idea of brilliant people finding a kindred spirit. I also always gravitate towards villains... also as someone stated they made two hot characters and hot people banging is hot. I'm not gonna lie that does help.

I will say if you are looking for one that tries to fit into canon I'd recommend checking out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7728303/1/unsphere-the-stars][Unsphere the Stars]]. Anyways the most important thing is it's fiction, ship and let ship. If it isn't your cup of tea there's a ton of other pairings to read out there.
