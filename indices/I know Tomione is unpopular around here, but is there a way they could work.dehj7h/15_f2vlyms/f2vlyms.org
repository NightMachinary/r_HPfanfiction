Well if they were near the same age range and attended Hogwarts at the same time then I think could be a possibility. They say Voldemort was very talented and charismatic if I can recall so they would match each other on an intellectual level. Smart and exceptional people don't necessarily need to only date others like them, but I hear its nice to have someone like minded who they can hold a conversation with. The problem would be his convictions and obsession with dark arts and finding immortality. So basically if he was more charming and less evil then I think it could work.
