Realistically, and outside of a situation where the pairing doesn't go into creepy non-con territory, it could only work if Tom Riddle wasn't Voldemort. Because an in-character Hermione Granger would not get into a relationship with someone who hated her kind and wouldn't hesitate to murder her parents. She wouldn't stand for the "you are a credit to your race" type of muggleborn acceptance, which is why Lily/Snape could never work.

It's the same for Bellatrix/Harry, the genderswapped version of this pairing. An in-character Harry would never date a Death Eater who murdered his godfather. But if the story is an AU where this never happened... then /possibly/, depending on the writing skill of the author.
