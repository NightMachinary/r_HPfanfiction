Stop trying to force the issue through pink colored glasses. Even if he wasn't exactly best of friends with Neville, he was one of his dormmates. And the little guy almost never got out of the shadow of his vegetative parents until the end where he shanked the nagini. He had seen the consequences of her actions haunt someone he personally knew and wasn't an enemy of his for close to 6 years. He was cordial with Draco at the end, but as far as we know, the idiot didn't kill anyone. Tortured them maybe and be a general pain in the ass but he was too incompetent as a villain for the most part. Even if you go through the angle of her being somehow useful and turning sides, he wouldn't trust her enough to stick it in her. First, Neville might snap if he found out and killed Harry in his sleep, second, Harry is pretty vanilla. His tastes are towards youthful looks(Cho who was in the middle of her puberty, Ginny who was younger than him.) so I don't get the image of him being attracted to old azkaban tits. And don't even dare to call her Milf. I know my Milfs. She isn't one.
