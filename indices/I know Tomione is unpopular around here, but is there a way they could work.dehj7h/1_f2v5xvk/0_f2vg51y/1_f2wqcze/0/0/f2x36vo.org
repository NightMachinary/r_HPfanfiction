What? Harry is friends with Neville even during first year. He goes with Harry to his duel with Malfoy, Harry rescues his Remembrall from Malfoy, and tells Neville that he's worth 12 of Malfoy. He snuck out at night - the very thing he later cautioned Harry against - to warn them that Malfoy was going to set them up when they were evacuating Norbert.

Also, something like 'tortured a pair of parents into insanity and made their infant son live with abusive relatives' isn't something Harry would let go just because he wasn't friends with said son.
