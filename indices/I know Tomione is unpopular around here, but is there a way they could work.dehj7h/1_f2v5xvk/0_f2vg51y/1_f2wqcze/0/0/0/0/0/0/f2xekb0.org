  Ron cast magic on a Muggle for no good reason. There was no danger of violating the statute, Ron simply made a mistake, which actually makes his actions fraud as well as he used deceit to get a driver's license (cheating during those exams is pretty much always counted as fraud). And no, Ron being able to use magic to replace the mirror check is not an argument. Most cars nowadays have have warning lights in the mirror if someone is in your dead angle, yet you still have to check during exams as that is what the lawmakers require as skillset for a license.

There is every possibility that the Ministry specifically allows for this type of behavior. To enroll in a driver's ed program and test for your license in the first place would require documentation that the Weasleys certainly did not have, meaning that some level of collusion with the Ministry would be necessary. Given that Ron /is/, in fact, a former Auror, it seems more likely than not that he is aware of the extent to which he can legally use magic in such an environment. The fact that Hermione expected him to do so only adds to this.

  Intent follows the bullet. It didn't matter that Malfoy was sloppy or didn't target Ron or Katie, he had the intent to kill and any victims of his actions count as attempted murder.

So, first of all, the fact that his family was being held on explicit threat of death if he didn't do just this is a classic mitigating factor. Second, you next note that:

  And it was very well within Harry's possibilities to, at the very least, make sure that Draco couldn't show his face without getting lynched. What do you think the public would have done if Harry had given a series of interviews where he quite explicitly points out how close Malfoy came to killing various students at a school and how he was pivotal in leading a group of Death Eaters into the school were every British child has to go?

/That/ would be homicide. I think you have your moral values all fucked up. Explicitly inciting mob violence just so someone can't have a trial? That's just evil. Also, Harry would have been called as a witness in Malfoy's trial, where he would have testified to all of that anyway, so your point is moot. Everyone already knew that Malfoy let Death Eaters into the school - or, at least, the Order did.
