Ron cast magic on a Muggle for no good reason. There was no danger of violating the statute, Ron simply made a mistake, which actually makes his actions fraud as well as he used deceit to get a driver's license (cheating during those exams is pretty much always counted as fraud). And no, Ron being able to use magic to replace the mirror check is not an argument. Most cars nowadays have have warning lights in the mirror if someone is in your dead angle, yet you still have to check during exams as that is what the lawmakers require as skillset for a license.

Intent follows the bullet. It didn't matter that Malfoy was sloppy or didn't target Ron or Katie, he had the intent to kill and any victims of his actions count as attempted murder. And it was very well within Harry's possibilities to, at the very least, make sure that Draco couldn't show his face without getting lynched. What do you think the public would have done if Harry had given a series of interviews where he quite explicitly points out how close Malfoy came to killing various students at a school and how he was pivotal in leading a group of Death Eaters into the school were every British child has to go?
