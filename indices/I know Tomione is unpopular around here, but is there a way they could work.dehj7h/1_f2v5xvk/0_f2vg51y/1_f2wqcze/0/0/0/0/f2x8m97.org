He didn't assault a Muggle, he cast a charm that allowed him to explain why he made a mistake without violating the Statute of Secrecy.

And Malfoy being alive was not his call. He is not a judge, nor is he an executioner. He couldn't go through with killing Dumbledore, and Dumbledore himself exonerates him of the assault on Katie, since the sloppiness was borne of him not wanting to kill Dumbledore, and thus subconsciously sabotaging his own attempts to murder Albus. Malfoy's family would have been murdered if he hadn't at least tried - Malfoy's actions preserved the most lives possible. He never meant to hurt Katie.

Also, being okay with someone being out of prison isn't at all the same as choosing to associate with them, and Harry and Malfoy are notably cold with each other even in the epilogue. These aren't equivalent at all with Harry getting into a relationship with Bellatrix.
