  Also, I don't believe that the Confundus is abuse - Harry uses it on people standing outside Gringotts.

That was when he was fighting a war, and the target was allied with Voldemort and about to pierce their disguise. Literal life or death matter, eminently justified.

And Harry's actions are hardly the canonical standard for judging what is or is not abuse/assault. He didn't have sufficient cause to use an Unforgivable torture curse on Bellatrix in book 5, for example; attack her, sure, she's an enemy combatant, but he didn't have to use that (and since he had no experience with that curse, it wasn't a good tactical decision either).
