Magical laws are irrelevant in this case, he is trying for a Muggle test after being challenged by his wife to do it the Muggle way. If Ron had done that during some Auror mission, I wouldn't complain. But he abuses a defenseless person because he wants to score cookie points with the missus.

And again, the existence of possible aids isn't an excuse during the exam, you still have to prove that you can do all basic stuff the old fashioned way, even if you don't need it later on (eg because your car has gadgets or because you have magic).

There is no indication that Draco ever stood trial. Nor that his father did after the first war, for that matter.

If there would be a reliable judicial system to conduct those trials, I would not condone other solutions. But you know who the biggest contributor to Voldemort's campaign of terror against muggleborns was? The Ministry of Magic. So you can't rely on the people who, until a few weeks ago were happily assisting in the systematic deportation of a race to act as independent judges. Until there is a systematic clean up in the Ministry, and Draco's freedom is proof that justice wasn't served, you have to consider other alternatives.

If you want a historical precedent, look at the Eichmann trial. Was it legal that the Mossad kidnapped him from anotherccountry to stand trial when the outcome was already clear as sunshine? No. Was it right to serve justice to someone who deserved it? Hell yes.
