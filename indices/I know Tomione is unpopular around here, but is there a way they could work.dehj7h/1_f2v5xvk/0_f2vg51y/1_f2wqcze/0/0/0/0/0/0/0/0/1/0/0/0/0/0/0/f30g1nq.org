There is only two mass surveillance spells in canon, the trace and the taboo. Neither of which control the passenger lists in Exeter nor stop you from crossing the Channel. Stop trying to come up with far fetched justifications when it is apparent that the average wizard has no clue about basic muggle stuff, nevermind how their border controls work (and that still leaves apparation and even simple broom travel uncovered).
