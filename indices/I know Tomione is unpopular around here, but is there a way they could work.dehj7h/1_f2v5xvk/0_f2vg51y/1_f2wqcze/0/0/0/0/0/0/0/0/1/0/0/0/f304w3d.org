You know what the French who were doing the executing were? Exactly like the Ministry. Sure, imprison/Veil your Umbridges and your... whatever the guy's name was who Harry Polyjuiced as. But 90% of the people there just didn't want to be murdered by the unstoppable warlock. Also, the Ministry was only snapping the wands of Muggleborns - it was just the Death Eaters who were doing the murders.

  They (the workers in the MoM) could have simply left the country, especially given that the distance between London and Scotland could take you across half a dozen international borders.

Need passports, need a method of egress (smuggling is monitored, so it's not as simple as hopping on a broom and riding to France), and need your new country not to kick you out, thereby risking becoming Voldemort's next victims.
