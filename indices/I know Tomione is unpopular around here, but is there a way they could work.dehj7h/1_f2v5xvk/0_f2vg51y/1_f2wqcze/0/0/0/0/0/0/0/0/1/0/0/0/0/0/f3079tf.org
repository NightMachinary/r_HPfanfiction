  So you're telling me that the Death Eaters run the security checks at Heathrow Airport? That they monitor every ferry terminal? That a wizard couldn't confund a ticket agent or a bored immigration officer? Or simply disillusion himself and sneak aboard the Eurostar? Nevermind simply apparating to France, the Low Countries or Germany (each a shorter trip than London Scotland) and remaining in hiding. Foraging from muggles is easy.

Yeah, how could they have covered all those bases? They'd have to be magic or something.

Besides, it doesn't matter if they don't have every egress covered, as long as you don't know which ones they do, especially when you ABSOLUTELY know that they have most covered. That's still a gun to your head, it's just one of the chambers is empty. You going to take that chance?

  There were choices, but everyone at the Ministry chose to still work there under Voldemort. The other options might have been inconvenient for sure, but they were there.

If you want to call death an inconvenience.
