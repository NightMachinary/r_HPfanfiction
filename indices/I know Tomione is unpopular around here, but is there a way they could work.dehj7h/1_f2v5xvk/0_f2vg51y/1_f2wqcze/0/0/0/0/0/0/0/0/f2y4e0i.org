  Magical laws are irrelevant in this case, he is trying for a Muggle test after being challenged by his wife to do it the Muggle way. If Ron had done that during some Auror mission, I wouldn't complain. But he abuses a defenseless person because he wants to score cookie points with the missus.

Well, he's doing it because he can't tell the Muggle about his magical solution. Also, I don't believe that the Confundus is abuse - Harry uses it on people standing outside Gringotts.

  And again, the existence of possible aids isn't an excuse during the exam, you still have to prove that you can do all basic stuff the old fashioned way, even if you don't need it later on (eg because your car has gadgets or because you have magic).

I'm not saying he earned the license, just that he didn't abuse a Muggle.

  There is no indication that Draco ever stood trial. Nor that his father did after the first war, for that matter.
#+end_quote

His father did, there are multiple references to that fact. We never see it in canon, because why would we? (Didn't we just talk about this in another thread a couple of days ago?) He didn't go to Azkaban by virtue of his last-minute ditching of Voldemort while Voldemort was still in control - this was the first moment he and his parents were out of direct danger from Voldemort. Also, Azkaban might not have functioned after Voldemort's defeat.

  If there would be a reliable judicial system to conduct those trials, I would not condone other solutions. But you know who the biggest contributor to Voldemort's campaign of terror against muggleborns was? The Ministry of Magic.

When corruption is found in a government, the solution isn't to immediately declare every part of it to be irredeemable. You just have known incorrupt agents go over sentences and incorrupt judges try all new cases. Obviously any trial would wait until there was a functioning court system - that's so obvious it doesn't need to be addressed, like assuming Harry isn't wearing pajamas just because it doesn't say he got dressed that day.
