So you're telling me that the Death Eaters run the security checks at Heathrow Airport? That they monitor every ferry terminal? That a wizard couldn't confund a ticket agent or a bored immigration officer? Or simply disillusion himself and sneak aboard the Eurostar? Nevermind simply apparating to France, the Low Countries or Germany (each a shorter trip than London Scotland) and remaining in hiding. Foraging from muggles is easy.
