It isn't just corruption, they were working towards the systematic deportation of a people while death Squads roamed the countryside and took care of everyone who escaped the bureaucracy. The Aurors, the clerks, the paper pushers, everyone there helped with a small scale genocide. And at the end of the war, Harry's side has almost no manpower left. There were a few Weasleys, Harry, Hermione and Kingsley (and a few DA members in various states of injury).

That's not enough to dismantle an entire bureaucracy who has a good reason to stay in power (so their actions during the war don't get investigated too closely). At most Harry's side had enough influence for a few token actions while the majority of the Ministry went on without deep investigation as they were irreplaceable.
