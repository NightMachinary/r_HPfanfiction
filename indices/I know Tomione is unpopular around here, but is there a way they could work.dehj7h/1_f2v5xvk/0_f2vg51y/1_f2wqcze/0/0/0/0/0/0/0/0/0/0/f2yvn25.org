  That was when he was fighting a war, and the target was allied with Voldemort and about to pierce their disguise. Literal life or death matter, eminently justified.

Yes, and? It still doesn't cause harm.

  He didn't have sufficient cause to use an Unforgivable torture curse on Bellatrix in book 5, for example; attack her, sure, she's an enemy combatant, but he didn't have to use that (and since he had no experience with that curse, it wasn't a good tactical decision either).

He's not thinking about tactics. He was in shock and attempting to take down a murderer. Crucio is the most powerful spell he knows the incantation to besides the Killing Curse. She was countering everything else he threw at her. And look, it /did/ work! He didn't even cast it successfully and she was on the ground in pain. Good job, Harry. Nonlethal incapacitation with only momentary pain on an opponent more skilled and experienced than yourself. Excellent tactics, even though you were thinking with your compromised emotions instead of your head.
