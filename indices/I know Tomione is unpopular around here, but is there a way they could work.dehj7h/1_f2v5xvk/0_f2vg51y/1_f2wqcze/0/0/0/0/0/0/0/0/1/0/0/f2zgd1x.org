You know what the French did to collaborators after the war? Quite a lot of them were shot. Same story in the USSR and Eastern Europe. Because yes, they were coerced, but coercion is not a valid defence if the crime you are accused of is assisted murder.

No one forced them to come to work and help with a genocide. They (the workers in the MoM) could have simply left the country, especially given that the distance between London and Scotland could take you across half a dozen international borders.
