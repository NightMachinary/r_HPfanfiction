I'm not the one downvoting you, FYI. People getting too heated about a fanfiction thread.

  It isn't just corruption, they were working towards the systematic deportation of a people while death Squads roamed the countryside and took care of everyone who escaped the bureaucracy. The Aurors, the clerks, the paper pushers, everyone there helped with a small scale genocide.

And most of those people are blatantly scared for their lives, livelihoods, and families. Remember when people talked about the first war, coming home to find the Dark Mark above their house, knowing that everyone inside was dead and it was your fault for resisting or simply being born impure? That's what happens here if you try to do anything other than your job as it's told to you. It's like blaming the Jews for the Holocaust. They're hopelessly outmatched.

It's not their fault, and they're not corrupt. They're collaborators. There's a difference. They're victims.
