Because Hermione has experience with relationships while, well Harry's were a train wreck and he comes across as even more clueless in the emotional department than Hermione with her lacking social graces.

And I'm not denying that the Harry/Bellatrix relationship would be beyond odd and unlikely, but I like these thought experiments were you try to improve unlikely concepts, like a believable Dramione.
