Assuming that you use a believable time frame, Harry would be at least 18 by the time you introduce romance. 18 - 46-7 is a large age gap, I'm not going to argue against that, but weirder things have happened IRL. Just look at the French president, who had an affair with his teacher (24 years his senior) when he was 16 and later married her.

Also, you are assuming that Harry would take the initiative, something I don't see happening with anyone older than him. It's already questionable in Harmony fics, nevermind Fleur or Tonks pairings. Most importantly, the go-to method of getting an unlikely pair together, alcohol, would do wonders in this scenario. Well, that and some magical anti-wrinkle lotion.

And older women are certainly a common fantasy, proven by both pop culture (eg American Pie's "Stifler's Mum") or, more explicitly, the popularity of the MILF tag on various NSFW websites.

Do I ship Harry/Bellatrix? No. But this would be one way other than time travel to get a story with that pairing underway.
