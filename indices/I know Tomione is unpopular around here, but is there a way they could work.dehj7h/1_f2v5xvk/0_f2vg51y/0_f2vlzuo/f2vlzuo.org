  there is a small window where you could make it work if Bellatrix defects after being broken out and before the DoM battle happens

Harry's first impression of Bellatrix was seeing her in the Pensieve at her trial in GoF.

#+begin_quote
  ...A woman, with thick, shining dark hair, and heavily hooded eyes, who was sitting in the chained chair as though it were a throne.

  The Dementors were gliding back into the room. The boy's three companions rose quietly from their seats; the woman with the heavy-lidded eyes looked up at Crouch and called, "The Dark Lord will rise again, Crouch! Throw us into Azkaban, we will wait! He will rise again and will come for us, he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters! We alone were faithful! We alone tried to find him!"

His impression of her was already fixed, long before he'd ever met her in person. I doubt time or circumstance would ever change his dislike of her, since for all his "forgiving nature", he remained on cool terms with Dudley, the Dursleys, and Draco Malfoy after the war (if you discount the shitheap that was Cursed Child) and they didn't commit any murders. And neither time, circumstance, or Bellatrix serving time would change the fact that she turned Neville's parents into vegetables.

It's a core part of Harry's personality to worship the idea of parents. /("Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew---and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents---that there was all the difference in the world.")/ This is how he decides that sacrificing himself for the wizarding world is the best thing to do, and why he blows up at Remus for even thinking about leaving Tonks and baby Teddy.

  The woman stepped forward, away from her fellows, and pulled off her hood. Azkaban had hollowed Bellatrix Lestrange's face, making it gaunt and skull-like, but it was alive with a feverish, fanatical glow.

And you can't forget that Azkaban turned Bellatrix obsessive and mentally unhinged, if she wasn't already crazy before. She's also skeletal looking and 30 years older than Harry.

This is why I don't think it's reasonable for Bellatrix/Harry to happen in the canon timeline, /without/ time travel, or without taking place in an AU with no Death Eaters or wizarding war. It is as improbable as a Hermione/Tom Riddle pairing to happen in a timeline where Tom has petrified/murdered muggleborns, his dad, and made horcruxes.
