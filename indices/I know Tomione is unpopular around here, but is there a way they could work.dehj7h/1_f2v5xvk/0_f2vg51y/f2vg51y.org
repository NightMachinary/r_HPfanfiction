Objection on the Bellatrix bit, there is a small window where you could make it work if Bellatrix defects after being broken out and before the DoM battle happens. That way you avoid that issue of Sirius and you can use the decade in Azkaban to justify a change of heart (eg Bellatrix never wanting to go back there and that desire overwriting any loyalty to Voldemort, or a decade there left her a lot of time to rethink her life). Obviously Harry (or Hermione) wouldn't want to bone her as they would be very vary, but give it a few years where they fight, sleep (figuratively) and bleed together, and Bellatrix past does not seem that much of an issue, especially as she wasn't directly involved in Harry's parents death (unlike Voldemort, Pettigrew and Snape). Especially if she saves Harry's, or more symbolically, Hermione's life along the way. It would cause a break with Neville, but as there was no ministry battle, the bonds with him aren't forged with blood yet.

I don't think that there is a Bellatrix fic with that plot, but that's the one way I can see a Bellatrix romance work
