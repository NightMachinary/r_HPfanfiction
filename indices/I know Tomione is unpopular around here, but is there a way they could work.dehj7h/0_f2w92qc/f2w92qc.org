Only with time travel, and before Myrtle is my sincere opinion. Yes, until then he had already did some scary things at the Orphanage, but he was also a child being bullied and not knowing exactly, it could very well have been accidental Magic. But Hogwarts after Myrtle was killed? It just went downhill from there and no, no redemption needed.

Unless you have Hermione become what Bellatrix went to become...then yeah, two crazy people together is also possible.
