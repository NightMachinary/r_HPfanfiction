I might be wrong here, but doesn't the Horcrux creation require cold-blooded murder? Meaning he had to kill her in cold blood for it to work.

But yeah, I've seen that interpretation (IIRC /Have You Ever/ did this, and when I got a curiousity for Tomione a while back, this is the fic I liked the most. It was written before HBP, so no Horcruxes).
