I had a thought about this recently. Riddle never bought into the whole blood supremacy thing. To him it was always about power.

The story I've wanted to write is a Tom is the same age as Harry fic. Riddle still creates a terrorist organization, but they are about remaking the wizarding world. 7 years at Hogwarts twisting and manipulating Hermoine into a dark lady.

The Tom Harry relationship is one of smiling rivals. They are cordial but despise one another.
