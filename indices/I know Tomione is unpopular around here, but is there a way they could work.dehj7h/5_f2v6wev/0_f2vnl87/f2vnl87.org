Most fics that pair Hermione with someone change her personality to some degree. as her book character is extremely unlikeable once you take off the friendship goggles. (This is completely lost in the movies.) With this particular pairing, Hermione would have to cry less often for Tom to consider dating her. Voldemort doesn't like crybabies.

  "He pointed the wand very carefully into the boy's face: he wanted to see it happen, the destruction of this one, inexplicable danger. The child began to cry: it had seen that he was not James. *He did not like it crying,* he had never been able to stomach the small ones' whining in the orphanage---"

It's kind of funny how most fanfic authors forget that Hermione cries a lot in canon. The reason why she was even friends with Ron and Harry in the first place was because she ran off crying when Ron called her annoying.
