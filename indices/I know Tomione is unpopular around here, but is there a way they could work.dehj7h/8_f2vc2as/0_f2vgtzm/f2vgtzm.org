That's the unbelievable bit IMO. If the war was really that bloody, Hermione "let's lead Umbridge into the forest to have her squashed by a giant. She got dragged away by creatures mythologically infamous for rape? Sucks to be her" Granger would simply kill Riddle. Because the best way to stop Riddle from becoming Voldemort is death. And yes, it is morally questionable, but it's simply the old "kill child Hitler" debate.
