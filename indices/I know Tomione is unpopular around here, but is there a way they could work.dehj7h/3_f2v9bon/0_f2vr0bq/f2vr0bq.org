I disagree about it not being him anymore. I've read many good fics that diverge before Riddle made any horcruxes. As long as the rest of his backstory remains the same (events at the orphanage, history of his parents, relationship with his peers and teachers at Hogwarts) a skilled author can show Riddle having the same core personality even after events diverge.
