Well, it's possible. I love a tomione fanfiction - [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5034546/1/Ultima-ratio][ultima ratio]] by Winterblume - cause it's well written and it's believable. After a long time reading tomione, I finally realized that time travel fanfictions are more believable than hermione and Voldemort - I really wish I could not remember reading one of those. So basically, time travel is fine if it is well written and Tom and hermione are like the same age. Hermione captured by death eaters and Voldemort falling in love it is not what I vibe and kinda not believable.
