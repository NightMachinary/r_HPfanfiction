This means Dumbledore (phoenix) and house elves are the only ones with magical teleportation . If Dumbledore the only person with access to magical teleportation (and can probably have the phoenix transport some of the more pure-hearted order members as well) and Voldemort had no killing curse I think the order would have destroyed them while they were still the Knights of Walpurgis. We are assuming everyone still doesn't care about house elf teleportation cause they didn't in canon even though they could teleport ANYWHERE though ALL magic.
