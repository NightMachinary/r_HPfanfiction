I always liked [[http://web.archive.org/web/20080308011248/http://www.themedicinewheel.net/series/computer.html]["The Room With A Computer."]] (link goes to the Wayback Machine) It's very low-key; it has nothing to do with Harry becoming more badass because mutants or whatever... it's just Cyclops from the original X-Men movies, after the death of Jean Grey, taking a job as Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts. Other X-Men show up for outings and cameos....

Best part of the fic, though? Arthur Weasley gets a ride in the X-Jet.
