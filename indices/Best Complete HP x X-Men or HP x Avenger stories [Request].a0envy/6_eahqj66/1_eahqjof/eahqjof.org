#+begin_quote
  By chance, the Avengers discover something about Loki that changes their view of him. In the beginning, they thought he was just crazy. Now, they know it was much more than that. They thought they knew everything about Loki's dark past just as well as they knew their, but it seems there was still something they didn't know. One-shot. If continued someday, will be slash.
