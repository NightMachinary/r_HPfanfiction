I enjoyed reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11707455/][The Outliers]]. linkao3(11707455)

It's an OC fic set in the 1940s. The main character struggles to help her sister cope with intense anxiety attacks +that cause obscurial-like uncontrollable bursts of magic+ (edit: I misremembered; the uncontrollable magic was in a different fic by the same author). In that time period 'female hysteria' was still considered a viable diagnosis, and St. Mungo's was taking inspiration from a recent Muggle innovation: 'electroshock therapy'. This was considered a promising alternative to the usual regimen of Draught of Peace (which tended to leave patients near catatonic after prolonged use).
