I couldn't get into this one when I tried reading it previously. The setting just didn't feel believable for me. And while a lot of that is the fairly out there premise, there are other stories with similarly ridiculous premises that don't trigger my suspension of disbelief limit as much, and the ridiculousness of the premises feels more natural. To each his own though. Maybe I'll give it another shot at some point.
