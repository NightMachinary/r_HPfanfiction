Linkffn(The Wizard of Harrenhal by DisobedienceWriter)

HP/GOT. Harry pubstomps Westeros, still worth reading as what he does with magic is unique.

Linkffn(The Katarn Side by Darth Marrs) A crackish sort of fic. HP/SW. Rather humorous at times. Kyle Katarn is an enjoyable character and as always Darth Marrs has some truly unique ideas.
