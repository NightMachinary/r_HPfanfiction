[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][/The Power He Knows Not/]] by Steelbadger is a pretty good HP/Lord of the Rings crossover. The same author has an even /better/ HP/LotR work in progress, but updates are sadly rather infrequent these days.

Most of the best HP/Star Wars fics are still incomplete, but I think that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11576387/1/The-Katarn-Side][/The Katarn Side/]] by Darth Marrs is probably the best completed one out there.
