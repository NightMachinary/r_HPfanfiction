The Debt of Time!!!!

Edit (I realized that I should explain more probably haha): DoT is an amazing fic where Hermione gets sent back to the Marauders era, but still exists in the Golden Trio era. It's really hard to explain (bc I'm bad at explaining lmao) but it's without a doubt one of the best fics I've read! 10/10 recommend, and the ending is really comforting especially after ATYD. (I just finished ATYD too and am also broken as fuck so if you figure out how to fix the hole that the fic left lmkkk)
