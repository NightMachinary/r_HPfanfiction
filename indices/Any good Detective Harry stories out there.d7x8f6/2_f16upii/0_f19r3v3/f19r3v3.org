Isn't that the one with the genderbent Watson? Could be another Sherlock one, idk. All I know is, it completely turned me off of that fic. It's just too damn weird.

3 movies, dozens of Sherlock episodes, multiple books by Conandoyle, and now this rando fanfic author makes the mustached sidekick a woman for no reason.... Yeah ok. "necessary for the plot" my ass.
