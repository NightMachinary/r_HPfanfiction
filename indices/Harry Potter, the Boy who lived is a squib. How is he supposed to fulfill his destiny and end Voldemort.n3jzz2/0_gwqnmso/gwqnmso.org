"Severus? Are you sure about this?", asked Dedalus Diggle.

Snape monotonously repeats what he's been saying almost all day "This is based on Lily's research, and we've tested it with Filch and Figg. If it makes you any better, feel free to stay here while it goes off".

After activating the rune, Snape apparated away, upon arriving at the small home they've rented, he listens to the multiple soft pops of the other Order members. At least everyone has enough brain cells to leave Privet Drive.

An hour later, Voldemort appeared on the street and waited. Soon, the blood protection will fall, and he can finally kill Harry Potter. Sure, everyone always said Harry Potter can't even lift a feather with magic, but shooting yet another Killing Curse on a Squib is easy, and it might help him sleep at night.

What Voldermort never bothered to research is, the Wizarding world actually tried to "cure" their Squibs. One of the attempts was based on the assumption that it's possible to take one's magic and give it to a Squib. None of them succeed, of course, you just end up with two Squibs. And thus, in the early hour of 27 July 1997, Voldemort unknowingly walked to the largest recreation of forgotten wards that remove his magic forever.
