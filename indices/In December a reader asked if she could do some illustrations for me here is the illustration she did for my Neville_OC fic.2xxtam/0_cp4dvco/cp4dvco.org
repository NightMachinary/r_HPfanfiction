Is the Vos mos est mihi mortem supposed to be You'll Be The Death of Me? That's not proper latin. :| Better would be : "Mihi mortem eris."

Maybe "Tu mihi mortem eris." if you really wanna emphasize the You.

Nice art though, and I can't even imagine how amazing it would be if some put that much effort into something I made.
