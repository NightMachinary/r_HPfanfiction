A ritual usually gets you advantages that are more permanent. I think it's a bit like how you anchor magic with runes, you just use the necessary sacrifices needed depending on the effect you want to create and anchor it with(in) your blood. Like Voldemort uses rituals in many fics to i.e. give himself immunity to most poisons and the like. I think something like a magic strengthening ritual would be...interesting but kinda hard to pull off. Usually sacrificing is explained like alchemy. You always need to sacrifice something in equal value to that which you want to obtain.
