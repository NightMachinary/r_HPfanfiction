  I'm not quite sure what the requirements are for the sacrifice beyond what I've given.

One thing I don't see get brought up is in both instances of this self-sacrificial protection, there is an underlying implication of an agreement that Voldemort would stop.

In Lily's sacrifice, due to Snape, Voldemort demands Lily step aside to spare her life while at the same time Lily is demanding that Voldemort take her life instead. The implication here is that her sacrifice was unneeded and Voldemort accepted her payment to spare her son.

In Harry's sacrifice, Voldemort gave Harry the opportunity to freely give himself up, so that the fighting would stop and no one else would have to die. Harry accepted, and through the power of his sacrifice Voldemort couldn't touch the students.

In conclusion, just as shown as the general theme in the books, there is great power and consequence in the choices we make.
