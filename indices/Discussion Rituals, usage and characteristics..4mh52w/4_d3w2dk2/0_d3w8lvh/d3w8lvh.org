There's mention, in canon, of wizards Transfigured (a wand-based process) into animals being permanently stuck in that form. The Fidelius Charm (though that may be a misnomer) appears to last forever, as does the Undetectable Extension Charm (Charms are wand-cast spells). A lot of jinxes and hexes, however, do wear off over time (Stunning Hex, Jelly-Legs Jinx etc). What are your thoughts on this?
