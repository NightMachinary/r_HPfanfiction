I see it as being 3 distinct types of magic. Wand magic uses an individual's own energy to create a temporary effect. Runic magic binds an effect in place either permanently or until the runes are destroyed. Ritual magic requires a sacrifice to create effects more powerful than one can create with wand magic.
