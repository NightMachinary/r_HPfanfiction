It depends on how the sorcerer supreme fits into everything. Maybe have them target squibs and muggleborns. Maybe reconfigure what squibs are by having their magic form differently? Wasn't mentioned in thor that magic and tech were one in the same? It would show how technology is behind and magic if we can't combine it.
