Although I would be possible that Wizards would view themselves above the problems of the Muggle world/they wouldn't want to be pulled into their shit and called to solve their problems and thus let the Muggles deal with what they can solve on their own.

I imagine there would be a department (Auror special force) that would occasionally be sent to interfere, and all of them would be highly trained in mindaltering spells/obliviating Ã  la Men in Black.

Perhaps they would be connected with the current director of SHIELD on an need-to-know basis, but even they wouldn't be aware of the extent of the Wizarding world.

And since Wizards are connected to pagan religion (Yule and stuff) I find it entirely possible that they knew of the existence of the Asgardians or at least Norse Wizards and were like - no, were not gonna interfere with those godly stuff. And 80 dead Muggles would hardly matter to wizards.

Thanos would be an interfering point I imagine but the other stuff...
