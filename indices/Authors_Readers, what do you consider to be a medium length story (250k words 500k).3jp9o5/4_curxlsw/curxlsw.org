For fan fiction, I'd say:

- 15k- is short

- 15-115k is medium

- 115-250k is long

- 250k+ is beginning to be /too long/ for a single story

- 500k+... a bit /absurd/. ( That's when it starts to mess with your dreams.. )

Look at the [[http://editorial.designtaxi.com/news-longbook2507/2.jpg][Harry Potter series]] for example. I've always thought most of them were decent length books, the medium length books (first three) are easy to knock out in a few hours, after that they start getting a bit wordy and it takes longer.

With Fan fiction, it's about the same. (Except those huge 500k+ fics...)
