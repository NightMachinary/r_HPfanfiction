Same here. As to 500k+, those are definitely epic for me, 300k+ is as a matter of fact. 150k-300k would be long then.

What I like more depends a lot on how much time I have and therefore how many days I'll have to stay with the story (So if I can only read 2-3h a day, I prefer medium length, as it lessens the chance of me getting interested in some other type of story along the way, but if I can spend the whole day reading, long to epic it is, so I don't have to search for something new every couple days.)
