I've got a rough outline of 17 chapters right now. So anywhere from 15-20 chapters. However, chapter length is also a factor. I might need to have only 5 000-15 000 words per chapter, so my chapter limit could easily double there. I'm basically checking to make sure my outline is viable, with that query.
