#+begin_quote
  In sixth year, Harry Potter falls victim to a masterful and evil plan from Voldemort. Now, 5 years later and with the world firmly under the grasp of Voldemort, Hedwig has a boring job at Amazon. When on a hectic Prime Day, the delivery center is attacked, effectively canceling Two-Day Shipping, Hedwig has to run for her life. What she doesn't expect is being caught by a magic explosion that turns her into an Aniowl. When a sudden turn of events sends her back in time, she would have a chance to fix everything that was broken. Can she learn how to speak English in time to save the world? Canon compliant until sixth year.
