What annoys me is when people go the other way and add on all sorts of non-canon abuse. The way he was treated in canon is more than terrible and should work fine for any plot line of that type.

As for those who don't think the Dursleys were that terrible, it genuinely makes me worried about their reaction to abusive situations in the real world. Hopefully its just that it's spread out a fair bit and they didn't notice.
