  What annoys me is when people go the other way and add on all sorts of non-canon abuse. The way he was treated in canon is more than terrible and should work fine for any plot line of that type.

Same. but I also understand because it's fairly easy and justified to assume that the casual abuse we saw in canon was just the tip of the iceberg, so to speak. I've also noticed sometimes that the authors are projecting their own abuse, or seem to think the canon abuse isn't clear enough which, given how some people think it isn't abuse, is a fair assessment.

Ron is another example where people seem to think we shouldn't bash him or isn't awful simply because people are blind to non-physical forms of manipulation and abuse. I'll shut up before I write an essay on Ron.
