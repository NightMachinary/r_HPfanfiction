I'm really bad at explaining so bear with me, I'll keep it short though, my main issue with Ron is his relationship with Hermione. Ron, throughout the time he's known Hermione, gaslights her, verbally and emotionally abuses her, and uses her. Hermione with her self-esteem issues, latches on to that kind of attention and dependency, and is thus emotionally, intentionally or unintentionally, manipulated into thinking she likes him. This never leads to healthy relationships later on, and often ends up with the Rons domestically abusing the Hermiones. Bickering and constantly sniping and fighting is not "aww they're like a married couple", and they do not have much in common besides Harry.

He makes her feel like she isn't attractive before Yule Ball, then when she shows up as the Belle of the Ball, he waits until her night is over and ruins it for her, that's an abusive person's classic poisoning tactic. She later makes the first move, invites him to Slughorn's party, he throws that in her face by snogging Lavander because he suddenly felt inadequate since he found out from Ginny that Hermione allegedly had made out with Viktor, and because of her assuming he used the Felix potion illegally.

Ron has jealousy and inadequacy problems, he feels like he's not good enough at anything and so others having something he covets makes him feel terrible. That applies to Harry multiple times (fame money etc) and Hermione (smart and praise from teachers).

Hermione has self-esteem issues stemming from her looks earlier on in the series and people's dislike of her for being bossy and a know-it-all. So much so that when Ron said what he did as a reaction to being shown up at magic by the demonstration of the floating spell as a kid, it broke her down because she feels that people dislike her and she's been trying to help people to make them like her but it's not working.

She also has (guessing here) a lack of close friends besides Harry, Ron, and Ginny which makes it hard for her to have someone to point out what I said to her as Harry is emotionally stunted, and Ginny is Ron's sister. Case in point, when Ron makes out with Lav, Harry fails to clearly stand with Hermione. As far as she knows, Harry is acting like this is just another of their fights, but it wasn't, it was Ron intentionally hurting her. To Hermione, her friend is communicating that this shit is okay.

All of this is just about Ron and how he is towards Hermione. Let's not forget the two times Ron abandoned the trio even when he immediately knew he was in the wrong, and his apologies when he came back were horrendous and only because both Hermione and Harry are dependent on him and desperate that they easily forgive him, and it doesn't help that Harry had repeatedly demonstrated that Ron is his closer best friend than Hermione.

This is not to say that I see Hermione as perfect. She has faults, she makes mistakes. She has communication problems and lacks the ability to know when she's wrong and when she should relax. That does not mean it's okay for her to be treated like that.

JKR, in a series written for children/teenagers, created an abusive relationship and said essentially "YO, this is relationship GOALS, boys who like you will treat you like shit and insult and manipulate you, you should marry them and you'll have a happily ever after with them. THIS IS REAL LOVE".
