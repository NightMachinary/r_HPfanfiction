I definitely hear your argument and pretty much agree. My overall feelings on the matter are definitely colored by my childhood perception, since I started reading the series when I was seven/eight, but objectively, what you say makes sense, and I do think Hermione and Ron don't make sense together, and she would have been much better off with Harry, at least compared with all the other well-developed male characters in her age range.
