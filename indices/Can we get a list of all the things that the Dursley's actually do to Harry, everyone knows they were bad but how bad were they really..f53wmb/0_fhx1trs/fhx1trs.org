There's already one, and even if we just go off the top of our head with being kept in the cupboard when there is another room, given only secondhand clothes when they can clearly afford more, telling him his parents were drinks who killed themselves, it shows the Dursleys actively engaging in emotional abuse and intentional disgusting neglect.

They're going out of their way to show him he's unloved, that he's a freak, that he doesn't deserve to be loved and cared for. Forget being physically abused, this kind of abuse is just as bad because it leaves mental scars that never go away.

I'm honestly sick and tired of people who come into this sub demanding we be "fair" to the Dursleys because "oh it's just a fanon thing, they weren't that terrible to him in canon". They were and they don't deserve to be forgiven.
