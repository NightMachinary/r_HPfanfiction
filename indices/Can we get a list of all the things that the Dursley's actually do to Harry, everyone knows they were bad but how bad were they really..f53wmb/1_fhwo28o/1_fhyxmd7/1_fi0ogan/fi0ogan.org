Starving someone and not feeding them properly are different things. Starving means not providing them enough food to function. Not feeding properly means feeding them the bare minimum needed to function and perform tasks. Besides, in HPSS, Harry states that the Dursley's didn't starve him, but they didn't exactly feed him well. Or something along those lines. So yeah, he wasn't starved just underfed.
