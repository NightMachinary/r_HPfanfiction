Kept him in the cupboard.

Never got a single present and no birthday greetings.

Never treated as a member of their family, so he never featured in any photos.

Lied about his parents.

He was very small for his age, means he was not properly fed.

Left him in one of the busiest railway station in Philosopher Stone.

Never took him to optician after his glasses were broken.

Locked him in the room like an animal.

Encouraged Dudley to bully Harry.

Petunia tried to hit him with a pan, but misses.

Ruined his reputation in neighborhood by spreading rumors.

Marge sets her bulldog on Harry, when he climbed a tree to escape, she left him there for hours while laughing.

These are the things I can remember.
