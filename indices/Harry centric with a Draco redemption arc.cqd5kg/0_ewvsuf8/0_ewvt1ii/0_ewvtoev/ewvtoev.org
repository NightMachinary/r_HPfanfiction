Hmm. I guess you could say Draco grows a healthy respect for Harry's power. I'm only half way through the fic however and Harry has grown friendly towards Draco but I haven't seen anything yet showing Harry taking regard of Draco's qualities.

They're forced into a situation of mutual compliance but through it they are growing friendly.
