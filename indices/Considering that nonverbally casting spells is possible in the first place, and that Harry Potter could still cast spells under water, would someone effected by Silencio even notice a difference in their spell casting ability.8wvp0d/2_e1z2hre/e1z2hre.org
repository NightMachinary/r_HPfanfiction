I think that being silenced is kind of irritating, and thus undermines your concentration, especially when you are in a combat situation and try to yell out a curse and then are reminded that you're not making any noise. With enough practice that should be easy to overcome, but there doesn't seem to be much value in it since if you let a simple spell like Silencio get past your defence in a fight then it stands to reason that you would get caught by something a lot nastier as well. Probably better to learn to cast a silent Finite as fast as possible and with as little wand movement as possible.
