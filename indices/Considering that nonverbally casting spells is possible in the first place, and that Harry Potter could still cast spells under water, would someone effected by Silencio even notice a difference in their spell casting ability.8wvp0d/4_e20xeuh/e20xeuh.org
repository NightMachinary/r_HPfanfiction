We can't really tell one way or the other, because the canon literature never explains how magic works to that degree.

One of the most plausible explanations in line with the universe is that it's a matter of confidence. Being silenced against your will, and then trying to cast a spell regardless, might put a damper on your spell-casting ability, whereas being underwater and vocalizing the spells expecting them to work might do just that.

It seems like silent spellwork is a later acquired skill, so it would make sense that, perhaps, spells are actually more effective said out loud than not, which is only avoided in the interest of stealth. There is also the possibility that it's like learning to read without vocalizing the text, after a while, it's the only way you do it and it's faster, but that comes with practice, and maybe some wizards do more of that than others.

It's also perfectly possible Rowling never gave this a second thought, and it was either a happy coincidence that it made sense anyway, or a bad one that it doesn't.

It's not something you can know for certain. I advise taking the fan fic authors' explanations and judging them on their own merits instead of trying to determine what the canon might've wanted to say. It's all made-up anyway, to one degree or another, and this is not a very well-explained topic.
