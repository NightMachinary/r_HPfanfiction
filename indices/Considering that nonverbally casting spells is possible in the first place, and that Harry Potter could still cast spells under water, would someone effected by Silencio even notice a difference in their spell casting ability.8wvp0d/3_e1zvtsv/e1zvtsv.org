I think it is (at least partly) the same way that Kido spells works in Bleach. As in, saying

#+begin_quote
  "Hado number 31, Shakkaho!"
#+end_quote

might work but not as effectively as saying

#+begin_quote
  "Ye lord! Mask of blood and flesh, all creation, flutter of wings, ye who bears the name of Man! Inferno and pandemonium, the sea barrier surges, march on to the south! Hado number 31, Shakkaho!"
#+end_quote

Of course IMO the same should apply to wand movement, state of mind, etc...
