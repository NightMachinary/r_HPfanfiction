Well that actually happens in canon.

Hermione silences Dolohov in the DoM, so when he casts the spell that hits Hermione it does not kill her, though she nearly dies.

Here is a quote from OotP:

  She winced slightly and put a hand to her ribs. The curse Dolohov had used on her, though less effective than it would have been had he been able to say the incantation aloud, had nevertheless caused, in Madam Pomfrey's words, 'quite enough damage to be going on with'.
