Ability with silent casting likely varies from wizard to wizard and, from what we see in canon, depending on the spell as well (ex. Levicorpus). There is a reason silent casting is not taught until NEWT level. Some spells in canon also seem to be more effective when cast silently or aloud, though the examples are a bit scant. This may be why certain spells are always spoken aloud (aside from obvious reader issues with silent casting).

Dolohov may simply have been poor at casting silently, or less skilled with the spell in particular. Of course, its entirely plausible Azkaban did not leave him and the other escapees firing on all cylinders, if they ever were, and damaged much of their mental faculty. Or they were out of practice with magic.
