I think it's just the fact that Dolohov was relying on casting the spell verbally rather than non verbally that weakened it's effect. He could've done the same curse to full effect without the spoken incantation, but didn't feel like mentally concentrating on the spell hard enough in order achieve that. So he just decided to rely on the verbal incantation to summon it instead.
