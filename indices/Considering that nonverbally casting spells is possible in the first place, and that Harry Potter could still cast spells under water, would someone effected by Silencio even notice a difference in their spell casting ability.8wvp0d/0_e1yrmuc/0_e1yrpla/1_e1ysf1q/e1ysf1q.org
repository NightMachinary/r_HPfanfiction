I think just like the wand is a magical focus, so is the incantation and the gesture that accompanies a spell. Taking stuff like this away diminishes focus to the point that most people can't cast the spells at all anymore... for others who are more talented it will mean that they can't cast complex spells at their full power. I'm sure Voldemort would cast the killing curse silently if he could.
