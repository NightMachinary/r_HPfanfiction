I had forgotten about that. I wonder what the reasoning for that is. Spells getting weaker the less able you are to pronounce them, I mean. With the only notable exception being nonverbal casting which just sounds... weird.

You'd think a wizard like Dolohov would have mastered nonverbal casting long ago, so why the holdup for him?
