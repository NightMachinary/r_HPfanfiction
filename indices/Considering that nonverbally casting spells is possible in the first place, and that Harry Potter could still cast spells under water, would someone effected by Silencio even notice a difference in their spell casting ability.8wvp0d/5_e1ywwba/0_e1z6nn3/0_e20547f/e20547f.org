You are assuming that the caster has to hear and identify their own sounds for verbal casting to work and no-verbal casting is merely going through the same process but no longer being required to hear what you are saying. Canon contradicts that. Not just in Harrys underwater casting but also in what it tells us about the process of learning to cast nonverbally. It is the act of producing the sound that makes up the verbal component of the spell. That's why distorting the produced sound has no effect but the removal of all sounds being produced does. Furthermore, in learning to cast non-verbally a wizard has to actively learn to forego the verbal component, to stop even attempting to produce a sound, to move his lips to the words of the spell, to accomplish this.

Note that during a certain Quidditch game in the first book even Severus Snape, an accomplished non-verbal caster, chose to cast verbally. Non-verbal casting is not a simple and easy substitute to verbal casting. It carries with it enough penalties to spell power and control that even proficient non-verbal caster choose to forego it as the situation demands.

If you consider two straightforward questions "word salad" then you really should work on your reading proficiency.
