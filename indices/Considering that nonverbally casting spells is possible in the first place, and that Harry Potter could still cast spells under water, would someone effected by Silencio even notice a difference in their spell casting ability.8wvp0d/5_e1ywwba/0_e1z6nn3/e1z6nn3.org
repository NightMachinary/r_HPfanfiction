I didn't do any of that. I was speculating that removing the ability for your words to to be literally heard would, perhaps, not effect the outcome of the spell because it's the /process/ of speaking that helps you concentrate and perform a spell better, not that the universe literally requires the words to be spoken.

To support this speculation, I pointed to a situation in which Harry cast spells underwater. What that ended up sounding like is nearly guaranteed to have been nowhere near what the spell actually sounds like, and yet the spell worked. This would seem to lend credence to the theory that it's the process that helps the individual caster but not a requirement and why nonverbally casting spells is possible in the first place.

Not... whatever the hell your word salad was implying I was saying.
