Beading. Sure, it does have a start-up cost, even non-trivial at that if you want to get into it seriously, but for people who have access to transfiguration it's basically a matter of getting some samples of the more unusual stuff they'll want and getting some info about what beads and other stuff used for beading is made of and how so for them it would easily close on a twenty-pounder.
