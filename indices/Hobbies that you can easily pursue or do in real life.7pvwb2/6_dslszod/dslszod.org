Maybe not easy, but worthwhile is to start learning a language. For example, there are all sorts of great free online classes for learning German through DW.com (I really like Nico's Weg), and I assume the same is true for other popular languages. There are also websites where you can trade helping someone learning English in exchange for help with their native language.
