You don't have to by expensive paints, brushes, or canvases at all. I've been an art student for six years now and I've been drawing for a lot longer and I still don't spend a lot of money for materials. It's not always worth it. A good artist knows how to make do with the stuff they already have. I've used nail polish as paint before, the bar isn't high when it comes to my materials
