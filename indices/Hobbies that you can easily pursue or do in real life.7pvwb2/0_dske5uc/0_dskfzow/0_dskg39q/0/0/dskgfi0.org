Well what country do you come from that has such high prices for paint? Also, I do own very cheap paints where a bottle is about 50Â¢ each. I've had my paintbrushes for years now, and they're still pretty good. I just get the ones that come in packs with many brushes inside. It's either that or I paint with my fingers. I'm not above doing that
