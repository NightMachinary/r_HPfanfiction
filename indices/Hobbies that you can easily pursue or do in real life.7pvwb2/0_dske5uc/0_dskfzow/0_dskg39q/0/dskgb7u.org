Maybe prices differ in our countries. I tend to prefer oil paint or acrilic and even the cheapest brands are somewhat expensive. Some brushes die pretty quickly so eventually I end up buying new ones.

And nail polish is just as expensive as oils and not as effective. But I see what you mean by using what you have, always try to do it myself:)
