If grammar and phrasing are serious problems it may be that being a beta for your fic is simply too much work to handle long term. Would you mind posting a passage of your writing? I am happy to give advice on how to improve your grammar and prose, and I think if you work on that as a foundation you will find it a lot easier to get feedback on plot.
