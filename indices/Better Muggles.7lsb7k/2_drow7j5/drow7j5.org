Grindenwald didn't hate muggles, he just thought they were inferior and should be ruled over by him.

The way I figure it, even from the beginning, it was a question of quality versus quantity. HP magic, while extremely powerful in many respects, just doesn't seem to be effective against more than a small crowd of people at a time. If it is, it's never shown. The only examples I can think of are utility magic like muggle repelling wards or the Fidelius, and I still maintain that such magics can be broken if put under too much strain. Otherwise, combat magic and such is mostly single target. Fiendfyre is less so, but it's also incredibly double edged, just as likely to kill the caster. Kings and military commanders in those days were quite willing to take large casualties if it achieved their goals, so throwing numbers at the problem would be a valid tactic, and one most likely to succeed. Another tactic is good old assassination. Unless a wizard goes full hermit, they have to interact with other people in some way, and that would leave them open to being stabbed in the back, whether literally or figuratively. Not even a wizard can counter every method of assassination.

In the modern day it's even more true. There are millions of muggles in any given city. Wizards simply can't fight that many people. At best they can set off a nuclear winter or descend the world into anarchy before they get swamped by lynch mobs, but any winning case for wizards is a pyrrhic one.
