Muggle-repelling Charms work on any number of muggles. Tactically, wizards can easily mind-control muggle leaders - or any muggle they want. Like, say, the one with acess to the army's heavy weapons, or those who can order the soldiers around.

A muggle mob is easily stopped by a mind-controlled squad with a few machine guns.
