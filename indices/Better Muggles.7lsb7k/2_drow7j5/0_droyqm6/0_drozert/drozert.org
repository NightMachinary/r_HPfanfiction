You say it works regardless, I say it's got a limit. Makes it slightly more realistic.

And sure, they can mind control whoever they want... assuming they have the knowledge and skill to cast one of the Unforgivables, have the willpower required to hold onto a mind and bend it to their will, have muggles around who even have guns, and, last but not least, have any single goddamn idea about anything muggle whatsoever, much less their military capabilities, their chain of command, or any other part of the muggle government required to carry out a hostile takeover of said government.

Mind control really doesn't solve every problem. Very few wizards are capable of flinging the Imperius around at the drop of a hat.
