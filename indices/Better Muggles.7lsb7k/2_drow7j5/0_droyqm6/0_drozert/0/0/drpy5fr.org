If it were that easy, it would have been done already. Grindenwald wouldn't have tried to make an army, he would have just gone ahead and imperiused people. Voldemort imperiused people, and it wasn't an immediate key to the city, it was another tool in his arsenal. There is zero reason for immoral people not to use it if it's that damn easy. There has to be some kind of limitation.

I do like the idea that mind magic negatively effects muggles more than magicals. Probably something that was never widely studied because nobody ever cared to, for various reasons.
