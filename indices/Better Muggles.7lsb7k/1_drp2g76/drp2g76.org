  Essentially what I want is a good, new idea for why wizards haven't completely dominated muggles that isn't just 'they don't feel like it'. Wizards are powerful people, and throughout history powerful people have been trolling and killing the ever loving hell out of their weaker peers.

Because they get something out of it: resources, greater manpower for military forces, superior terms of trade, religious dominance, etc.

Muggles have literally nothing that wizards want. There is no incentive to conquer them and even less to wipe them out.

Which is in turn why it's nonsense to talk about wizards being "forced to hide". Wizarding secrecy is something wizards /value/, not something they consider a burden. There is nothing that wizards are missing out on by maintaining secrecy.

In any case, in every functional sense wizards already have conquered Muggles. They interfere in Muggle government at will, at both the domestic and international level.
