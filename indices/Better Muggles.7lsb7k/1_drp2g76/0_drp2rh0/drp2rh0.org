I'm not talking about conquering. I'm talking about genocide.

Genocide is a thing humans do, when we are convinced we are better or that the enemy is disgusting. Hitler tried it and, using modern technology and infrastructure, was terrifyingly effective.

And yet no wizard Hitler has tried? No magical community ever tried to create their own country without muggles, the same Nazi Germany tried to create a country (and world) without nonwhite people? If magic in Harry Potter is as strong as the stuff I've been reading about in the anti 'muggle wank' threads, then I don't see anyway how a muggle government could really do anything if their wizarding community turned against them, and I don't buy the argument that wizards have always been so enlightened that nobody ever tried.

Even in my original post I said I hate answers like 'cuz they can't be bothered/ it's not worth it. Even if a society didn't desire any if the resources, all it would take was one terrorist cell teleporting around to every major city casting fiendfyre to kill millions.

People can always be motivated to do terrible things by hatred. And I want good ideas for why muggles, which so many wizards seem to hate even in the modern era, managed to survive enough of (if it mimics muggle history) what would have been a much more hateful history to become a dominant species.
