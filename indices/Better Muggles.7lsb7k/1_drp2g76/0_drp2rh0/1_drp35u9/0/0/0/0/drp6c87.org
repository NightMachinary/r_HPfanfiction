I think there's a few points you're missing.

1. I already mentioned Voldemort's regime as a time when wizards did exactly what you say they have never done: as a large scale group embarked upon an industrial scale act of evil which would sooner or later turn its eyes on the Muggles. But as I mentioned above, other wizards stopped this regime, just as tends to happen to such regimes in the Muggle world.

2. I think you're overestimating the extent to which wizarding societies are separate. The international wizarding community is far more integrated than the Muggle equivalent and there is a common, international, cultural consensus that the Statute of Secrecy is a good thing for wizards. So any society of wizards (e.g. Grindelwald's followers) which went against this would quickly find themselves clashing with the larger international wizarding community.

So fundamentally I think not only are you overstating the evil of Muggle societies but also the goodness of magical ones. The fact is that the wizarding world, just as the Muggle one, is generally good but has instances of bad people who sometimes gain significant followings, but sooner or later are defeated by those who are generally good.
