The historical answer is simple: prior to the statute of secrecy, wizards had greater allegiance to Muggles of the same nationality than to other wizards. We know, for example, that the Malfoy family fought for William the Conqueror in the Norman conquest of England. Since every nation has wizards, they more or less cancel out, but certainly there will no doubt be wizards participating in magical aspects of what we consider Muggle atrocities.

/After/ the statute of secrecy, the aforementioned international cultural consensus on non-interference with the Muggle world holds, and the community is self-enforcing against individuals like Grindelwald who try to break it.

  Also is the wizarding community really so well integrated?...and I can't think of any canon events that would indicate that wizards are more globalized than muggles (the UN is muggle after all, as well as the Geneva Convention, and those are pretty comparable to the Statue of Secrecy).

The ICW has much more power than the UN. It's more like the EU in terms of the way it infringes on national sovereignty. Some examples of wizards having much greater levels of international integration than Muggles:

- The ICW has removed at least one Minister for Magic from office (Damocles Rowle).

- The ICW forbade wizarding interference in WW1, something which national wizarding governments had to enforce (though there were many breaches).

- The British Ministry and MACUSA agreed not to involve themselves in the Muggle American revolutionary war, picking loyalty to kind over country.

- The British Ministry cooperated with a foreign Ministry in HBP to have a foreign President forget to telephone the British Prime Minister.

  If so why did no one intervene to stop Voldemort?

Speculatively, because he made sure never to endanger the statute of secrecy.
