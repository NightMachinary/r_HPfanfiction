But throughout history, people on the whole have also been pretty god damn racist. And societies on the whole have done some pretty fucked up things to other societies.

I love people. And I know that people are nice to other people. But throughout history it has been really easy for people to convince each other that the people living over there who looked different, or acted different, weren't actually people. Nazi Germany was exceptionally brutal yes, but the British Empire came before it. The whole colonial age came before it.

People are awesome, and nice yes. But we're also really good, as societies, at dehumanizing each other when it's convenient. Entire societies can be pretty overwhelmingly racist (like the US during the Slave Trade), and those societies can do some pretty inhuman things to other people, not because they're all sociopaths, but because they don't see the humans suffering as people.

All throughout history, humans have been good at treating each other well, and just as good at taking any tangible difference (either in behavior or appearance) between their in-group and an out-group to justify bad behavior. Wizards could still abuse muggles and be law-abiding, if there are no laws against abusing muggles (like their weren't any laws against owning slaves). Wizards can treat each other well and abuse muggles, because why would that matter? Members of the KKK lynch a black person and then go home, kiss their wives and be wonderful dads to their kids; racists don't just go around yelling racist things all the time; when they're not being racist, they're being people.

So I don't think my view of human nature is inaccurate. I think Men in Black said it best: A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky dangerous animals and you know it.

So I just don't buy that no wizards, who have a truly tangible, life-defining difference between them and muggles, a much greater difference than any of the ones muggles have used to justify killing each other, don't use that difference to abuse muggles, especially considering how hard it would be for the Ministry of Magic to catch them (mind magic, lack of trace, etc...).

And I don't buy that there was never a society of wizards who (like how the US decided black people weren't people during the slave trade) decided muggles weren't people. That would mean that wizards, despite having their own societies completely un-reliant on muggle society, never went through any of the moral stumbling that muggle societies did and still do. And that would imply, to me, that Draco is right and wizards really are better.

To make my point clearer; yes a civil society mandates that it's members accept that societies rules and acts as a group to enforce them. But the rules that society agrees on don't have to be anything us sitting here would say is moral, or ethical.

So, to get back on topic, my main point was that if wizards really were so overwhelmingly powerful than muggles then, considering how blood purism seems to have been around for a long time, there should be no muggles left. Back in the Dark Ages a single wizard could wipe out an entire village. And considering how muggles used to burn witches, plenty of angry wizards would have plenty of reason to do so (cuz even if the muggles can't actually hurt you cuz of the flame freezing charm, you would still be very, very angry).

And what I actually wanted from this thread were reasons why wizards wouldn't be able to do that. Reasons why muggles came to dominate the world instead of wizards that don't rely on wizarding apathy or good nature, because one of those isn't relevant, the other means wizards really are better than muggles and, looking at history, neither reason truly make sense to me.

The one possible reason I could get from your answer is that wizarding society initially sprouted from muggle society (muggleborns are the source of magic) and so wizards couldn't go around wiping out muggle villages because every village and town would, undoubtedly have a small community of muggleborns defending it. Because that's what would make a lot more sense to me; not wizards just uni-formally coming into existence with the morals and ethics muggles took hundreds of years to develop. But prehistoric, smaller scale wizarding societies sprouting from muggle ones and protecting their non-magical neighbours. Do you have any idea of the whole 'all wizarding lines began with a muggleborn' theory being canon? Because now that I think of it I think I've seen it a lot in fics theorizing about the source of magic, but it could just be popular fanon.
