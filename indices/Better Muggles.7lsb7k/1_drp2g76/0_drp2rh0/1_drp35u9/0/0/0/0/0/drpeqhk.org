But I'm talking about throughout history. The muggle world only recently became 'good' in its attitudes and view points. Not long ago a whole industrial nation kept an entire race as slaves and no other country went to war with them over it. And before that Britain sailed around conquering and subduing people's all over the world and other countries only fought them because they wanted to do the same thing. And the further back you go the more brutal people got towards each other for the simplest of reasons.

I'm not talking about modern muggle societies, I'm talking about how considering how xenophobic people have been throughout history it's hard to see how muggles still exist. Look what happened to the Native Americans. That's what muggle society is capable of, when we feel like it. And if I wanted to google I could probably find more examples.

It doesn't matter how nice muggles are now: the learning curve was steep and took thousands of years. And if wizards had to go through a similar learning curve, then I don't see how muggles would still exist unless some wizards were protecting them for some reason (my muggleborn theory), keep there was something about muggles that prevented wizards from attacking them.

Also is the wizarding community really so well integrated? If so why did no one intervene to stop Voldemort? Your first and second points seem to clash to me, and I can't think of any canon events that would indicate that wizards are more globalized than muggles (the UN is muggle after all, as well as the Geneva Convention, and those are pretty comparable to the Statue of Secrecy).
