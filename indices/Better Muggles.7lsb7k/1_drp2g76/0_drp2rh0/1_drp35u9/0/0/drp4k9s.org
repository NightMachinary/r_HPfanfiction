This feels a bit 2edgy4me material. People are on the whole good. People are on the whole law abiding. People on the whole act to prevent others doing wrong. These things are pre-requisites for civilisation. No civilisation can function on enforcement of good behaviour through fear of punishment alone. A civil society in which the vast majority of people accept the rules of that society and act as a group to enforce them on rule-breakers is the cornerstone of human societies.

It sounds like your problem is less with the set-up of wizarding society and more an inaccurate view of human nature.

Nazi Germany is the exception, not the rule, and it already has its wizarding analogy in Voldemort's government.
