But why? Why has there never been a whole society of racist wizards willing to try? Cuz if there never has been then we're getting to the point were wizards, morally, really are better than muggles. If wizards never had any of the ethical stumbles muggles have had (we've done genocide a whole bunch of time, and spent a lot of the time in-between them abusing each other), then the Malfoy's are right. Wizards are better than normal people, and Wizarding society is better than normal society.

I just can't buy a society of powerful people living alongside a society of what is essentially powerless people without abuse. Maybe not the genocide I'm talking about, but definitely abuse. Muggle governments can barely prevent date rape and people travelling to third world countries to do bad stuff to children. Wizard criminals and psychopaths live right next to a society full of women literally completely and utterly powerless to stop them, and yet nobody ever talks about all the opportunity for abuse?

Every unsolved crime in muggle history could very possibly have been done by a wizard. Hell, considering how easily a wizard could frame somebody possibly a lot of solved crimes as well. I don't see how the Ministry of Magic could stop this, seeing as how the Trace is removed from adults and mind magic is broken powerful.

That's what I'm trying to get right in my mind. If wizards just don't/have never abuse muggles on a wide scale / tried to genocide them, the wizards and wizarding culture really is superior to muggle culture in a significant way. But if they did, then how did they not succeed?

And what I'm interested in is not debating forever why wizards wouldn't do stuff like that, but rather brainstorming interesting ideas for why they couldn't.
