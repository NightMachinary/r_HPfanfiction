  And yet no wizard Hitler has tried? No magical community ever tried to create their own country without muggles, the same Nazi Germany tried to create a country (and world) without nonwhite people? If magic in Harry Potter is as strong as the stuff I've been reading about in the anti 'muggle wank' threads, then I don't see anyway how a muggle government could really do anything if their wizarding community turned against them, and I don't buy the argument that wizards have always been so enlightened that nobody ever tried.

We have numerous examples of evil wizards who have tried various things involving an anti-Muggle sentiment. But other wizards have always stopped them.
