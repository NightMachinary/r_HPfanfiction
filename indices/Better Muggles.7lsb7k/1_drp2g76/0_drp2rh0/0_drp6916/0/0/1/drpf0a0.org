I like this. You seem to be the first person here to realize that once upon a time wizards would have had a 17th century perspective, that their culture would've have changed over time like muggle culture has.

So I wonder why a community of wizards didn't kill off all the muggles in an area and start their own nation, way back in the BC? Maybe Atlantis tried (and blew up or sunk or something) and failed everyone else got spooked?
