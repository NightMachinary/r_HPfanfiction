Some wizards might have done that, actually - who would know, once they erased knowledge about magic from muggles, which presumably included adjusting history?

But back at the time, I don't think many would have wanted to do so - they were part of the muggle power structure in many countries, after all. Tribal shaman, priests, priest-kings, court wizards, nobles etc. Some posters don't seem to understand that many people like it, like it very much if they are above other people.

Not too many wizards would have wanted to go from a person far above the muggle peasants to just another wizard among many, without anyone to lord it over - and worse, being the most bottom rung of the new society.

How many of today's rich would want to move to a country where they can live in luxury as before, but would be the poorest of the country?
