People have created their own country without muggles - that's what muggle repelling charms do. It's just that with magic, you don't need to have a territory that's coherent - you can spread out, since instant travel means you're as connected to others no matter if they're down the road or hundred miles away. But Wizarding Britain is essentially a country of its own, and doesn't contain any muggles.
