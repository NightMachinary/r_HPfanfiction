I do really want the threat to come from the muggles themselves though, because I want the dominant species on a magical planet to be magical as well. A magical species so invasive and genocidal that all the other magical creatures said 'fuck it' and went into hiding.

The coolest idea I could come up with is that science and technology actually is muggle magic; the universe is actually inherently magical and muggles, by observing it, force reality to obey the laws of physics, fucking up everyone else's magic and building nukes.
