  the universe is actually inherently magical and muggles, by observing it, force reality to obey the laws of physics, fucking up everyone else's magic and building nukes.

This is meaningless.

Lots of science can be performed by simply looking hard enough at it. For instance, you can prove the Earth is round by looking at the moon, running down a long flight of stairs, and then observing from the bottom that the position relative to the horizon has changed.

If you're referring to the higher sciences, fine, that's not immediately observable in most cases. But at the same time, you're essentially saying that reality is magical until you observe it, at which point it's classifiable. Which, really, just means it's always classifiable. Superpositions cant exist if the observable outcome is always certain. That's not how they work.
