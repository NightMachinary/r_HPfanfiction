No. I'm not talking about anything like what you're going on about.

In this theory, the story world would literally be run by something akin to wild magic: the world would literally work like a story, or a vaguely animist religion. Animals are capable of randomly attaining sentence. The weather is a half sapient force. Magic is everywhere, animating everything, giving everything from gravity to magnetism to trees a certain will that means their behavior can't be predicted.

And then muggles stroll up and turn the world from an animal into a machine. And it's magic because it only happens for muggles. For a wizard how fast a fire spreads would depend on how fire us feeling that day, while if there was a muggle nearby suddenly fire would behave differently, following what muggles think are the laws of how reality works, but is actually just the shape muggle magic forces reality into.

Essentially muggles would be reality warmers that warp reality in one specific way, but I admit at this point the story would be hard to fit into the shape of Harry Potter canon.
