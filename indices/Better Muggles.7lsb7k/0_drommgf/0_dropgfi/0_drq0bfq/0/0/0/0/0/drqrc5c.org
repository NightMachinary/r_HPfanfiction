Ah while I do like your interpretation, it isn't quite my idea. In my idea wizards would be completelely incapable of trying to structure the world like muggles do; they wouldn't posses the ability to tame it. A wizard trying to figure out how to aim a bow and arrow better would quickly run into a brick wall; how accurate his shots were wouldn't depend on things like wind resistance or thrust or anything he could predict (though they would play a role in making the bow work), but rather on magical stuff like how the wind felt about him vs. how it felt about his target, how the bow felt about being used by him (was he been maintaining it well enough for it to 'like' him?) and stuff like that. Science as we know it would be completely impossible for wizards, and a story like HPMOR would involve Harry realizing that no matter what he does, he can't study magic that same way muggles study nature, and being forced to adapt.

The reason muggle technology wouldn't work in Hogwarts wouldn't be because magic interferes with technology, but rather because without a muggle nearby to keep them honest the electrons just won't behave themselves. In fact, the more fiddly technology gets the more it requires muggle attention; the Hogwarts train is the highest technology wizards can use without help, and the Weasley car would have never worked, or gone crazy the second there wasn't a muggle close enough to keep the engine from developing free will.

The problem with replicating the old spells of past wouldn't be about lost formulas or words, but rather about trying to replicate the relationship those wizards had with nature; parseltongue would be broken because it would give wizards who have it an even greater ability to converse directly with parts of nature, and strike deals. Spells being language and costing energy would be explained away as deals that nature liked so much it lets everybody use; complex rituals would complex because the wizard to form a more personal connection to achieve what they're doing.

And even then there would be a hard cap on wizarding power (why wizard could never cause global warming) that wouldn't limit muggles, because there would be things nature simply wouldn't let wizards do.

It wouldn't be about wizards being afraid of becoming muggles. It would be about wizards being unable to operate the way muggles do and being unable to just conquer them, and the modern era making them consider if maybe, just maybe, they might have gotten the short end of the stick.
