  The main problem I have with the idea though is that it kind of divorces muggles from the entire magical world.

That's entirely true. However, kinks being worked out that you elaborate on lower down, it would be a legitimate catalyst for the over-the-top rage you see at some magic users against muggleborns.

Sure, them having magic means you're forced to deal with them /somehow/, but when they try to "fix" the wizarding world without really understanding what that means, they actually threaten quite a lot more than just social structure. If you try to approach magic scientifically, you tear it down.

A story like HPMOR where Harry tries to spread science could have led to a magical extinction.

  So I'm trying to think of ways to turn it into more of an active ability, rather than a passive one

This might not actually be necessary. Maybe /everyone/ was magical, at one point. Maybe it only took one person using what most would perceive as common sense to tackle every day problems to start breeding non-magicals.

Imagine, some guy is kind of shitty at aiming his spells, so he tries to work out how to do it. He takes into consideration the air, the angles and, wallah, he completely loses the ability to use magic. But his descendants make bows and arrows.

It was slowly as technology grew (primitive, granted, but growing nonetheless) that wizards realized what was happening. Magical people started to be less and less magical. Muggles arose. Wizards were still dominant, but were now definitely and distinctly different from muggles.

Then comes what we consider the Renaissance. Suddenly muggles are born more and more and more and wizards, frightened that magic is completely dying, isolate themselves.

Once isolated, they find that this happens less and less. Wizards are very unlikely to have "squibs" than before. However, when it /does/ happen, it's extremely shameful. It shows that the parents, at some point, attempted to look at the world in a structural way. People, like the Weasleys who had an accountant in the family, are considered Blood Traitors.

Obviously we're getting /very very/ AU at this point. Lots of stuff would have to be changed to properly reflect it, but you can use a whole lot of snippets and callbacks from the original series to make people /really/ think about it.
