Holy fucking shit this was not the reply I thought I would get. This being the internet I fully expected you to come back in a wild, incredibly ignorant rage, ready to take a hot steaming dump on my ideas and insinuate questionable things about my mother. You may have single-handedly restored at least half my faith in humanity with this.

The main problem I have with the idea though is that it kind of divorces muggles from the entire magical world. A story like Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them couldn't possibly have happened in a world where muggles worked like this: Jacob would have wrecked any magic he came into contact with.

So I'm trying to think of ways to turn it into more of an active ability, rather than a passive one, but even then it feels underwhelming to have, mostly because it isn't of much help to individual muggles. What's the point of forcing reality into shape where building computers or spaceships is possible, if as a single person, you don't have the education, materials or manpower to do such a thing, and now your life is so much harder because the easy way (magic) is gone?

Any ideas?
