I like your idea.

It's basic human nature to abuse every advantage they have. I absolutely don't buy that Wizards went into hiding because they didn't want to rule over Muggles. They went into hiding because of an existential threat.

As for what that threat was, it didn't even have to originate from Muggles. It could very much deal with some powers that Wizards feared and respected.
