I'm going to throw this out there;

Risk vs. Reward / Effort Vs. Reward

To wit, we don't (in canon) know of any wizard farmers. We know of wizard herbologists, but there don't seem to be any wizards out there devoting themselves entirely to the task of growing wheat, and raising cattle.

Why? Because it isn't worth the effort of doing so. Not when muggles focus on doing it already, and being as there are so very many muggles, growing such massive quantities of wheat, raising a veritable avalanche of cattle, why would a wizard bother? After all, their muggles grub about in the dirt for them.

In my mind, this is the entirety of Gringott's stranglehold on the wizarding economy - the goblins managed to keep the wizarding world on the gold standard, while being the only option to reliably transfer wizarding currency into muggle currency, for the purposes of purchasing food.

So, wizards focus on wizarding things and Gringott's reaps the rewards of ever increasing profit. (1 oz of gold, converted dollars, then the dollars spent on wheat buys a ~lot~ more wheat in 1990 than it did in 1890. Not that the Wizards know that).

This same logic applies to ~everything~ non-magical. From cotton to timber, muggles just do it on a grander scale and cheaper. Why would you want to wipe out your servant class?

Continuing the argument, all these things that the muggles do so well, takes massive tracts of land. Even given the less than whole percentage value of wizard representation of the overall population, that is still land that would have to be obtained, and then obscured. Which represents a risk in dealing with muggles wondering who bought the land, what is being done with the land, and neighboring muggles/muggle corporations wanting to obtain the land for themselves. Why take the risk and deal with the hassle?

We can easily make our arguments about human nature, but I choose to base mine on one that has been proven again and again. The path of least resistance for the greatest reward.

Now lets look at it from the muggle perspective.

Wizards. Who gives a fuck? They can't magically create food and most of their magic doesn't do us any good, and even if it did, a significant majority of them are uneducated luddites. Yes, some of them cause trouble when their trinkets fall into the hands of the mundane population. Yes, catching their criminals is unreasonably difficult. Luckily, we have contacts in their government to send the reports, to and really we have larger issues.

Wizard Dark Lords are a danger, but while they can kill with ease and seeming impunity, one man and his deranged cadre of a couple hundred followers, even with their magic tricks, isn't any larger of a threat than domestic terrorism. Fortunately, most of their targets are their fellow wizards, although the targeting of a wizards muggle parents is rather unfair.

If the trend of killing each other off in significant numbers every generation or two continues, our current data, as gathered since 1906, indicates the population sustainability should terminate before 2200. We expect a complete breakdown in wizarding social services several decades before that, with muggleborn wizards no longer having the option of a wizarding education. Our current plan is to treat muggleborns as having a genetic disorder/medical condition, and offering supplemental classes on controlling their condition alongside a standard education. With a normal background, and proper civic values, it is entirely possible one of our citizens might one day find a way to make a useful contribution with their condition. Maybe they can finally figure out how to vanish nuclear waste, or to have transfigured materials interact normally with technology.
