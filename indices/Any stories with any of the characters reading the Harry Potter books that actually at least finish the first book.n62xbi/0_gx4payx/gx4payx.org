#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore.

  Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.
