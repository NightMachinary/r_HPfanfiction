Books because of the added element of desperation from Snape. Movie!Snape almost seems to not really understand what is happening.

Book!Snape is staring at Nagini, wrapped up in a protective bubble, and Dumbledore's orders are ringing in his head. 'When Voldemort is overprotective of his snake, tell Harry'. He's practically begging to Voldemort to let him go finish off Harry for him.
