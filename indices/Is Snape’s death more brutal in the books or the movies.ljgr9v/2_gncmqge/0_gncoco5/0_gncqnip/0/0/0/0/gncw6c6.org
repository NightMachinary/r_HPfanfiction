To me that was a place of hope almost. It was built to keep a werewolf in (lupin) but became a place of his friends coming to him and working hard to become what he needed at that time, a place where harry found his Godfather and learned the truth and then where he met sirius often and felt loved. A place he had hope that he would get to leave the dursleys and then voldemort tainted that too and you learn the truth on snape and harry watches one of the last links to his mom (no matter how shitty the person) die as well to the guy who's responsible for his shit hand in life. Thats my feeling anyway
