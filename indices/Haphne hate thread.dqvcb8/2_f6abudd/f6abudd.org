Honestly I have no good reason to hate this ship but it's always the same sh*t. Bashing of Ginny, Daphne is beyond perfect. Senseless bashing too! They don't even try for an original plot! There is literally no fic were I have seen depth of character when they are together. So stupid! I'm just gripping now but when I see what authors do with other characters who really have to past or anything involved. I'm always disappointed in Haphne fics!
