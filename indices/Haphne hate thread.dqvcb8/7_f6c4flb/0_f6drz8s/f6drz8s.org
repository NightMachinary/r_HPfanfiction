The thing is, though, most of the more popular Drarry fics, at least on ao3, are less Harry going pureblood and more Draco becoming less of a bigot. For the most part, fanon!Draco, especially in Drarry fics, is still continuing on from before the books ended when we still held onto hints that Draco might get a proper redemption arc, rather than the cowardly non-actions he took in Canon.

As far as I know, there are no Haphne fics where she rebels from her family or the agenda of her peers in order to do the right thing. It's mostly Harry becoming self - important, because traditions.

Edit: Typo.
