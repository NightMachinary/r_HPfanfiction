Harry Daphne has the same appeal as Harry Fleur. They are pretty blank slates and can be written however you want to. They are both capable of relating to Harry on the sense of people liking them or their name. Both can help introduce Harry to magical culture. Both are intelligent and can fight with Harry. Both are a far better choice than Ginny who had a crush on the BWL and never overcame that.
