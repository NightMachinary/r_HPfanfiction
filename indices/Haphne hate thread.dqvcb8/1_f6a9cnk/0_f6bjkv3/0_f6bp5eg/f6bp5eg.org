If we're being honest, the only reason the lead girl in Harmony isn't more intelligent /and/ beautiful than Hermione is because it's Hermione, but Hermione in Harmony stories is far more intelligent and beautiful than canon Hermione.

Lmfao, I enjoyed writing that.

It's the original god mode ship and those gripes make up the formula for most Harmony (and Indy Harry) stories, particularly during the time that group was feeling extra bitter and scorned.
