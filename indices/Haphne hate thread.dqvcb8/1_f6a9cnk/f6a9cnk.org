Oh why not? I'm actually somewhat fond of it, but have my gripes.

1. Ice Queen Daphne. I almost never see her portrayed as anything other than the stereotypical "Ice Queen of Slytherin" who's cold, distant, and aloof from everyone at Hogwarts. She's also either a pureblood who just happens to disagree with Voldemort or a Half-Blood who found her way into Slytherin. This means she's just waiting for Harry to come and melt her poor ice queen heart, and ally with him in his fight against Voldemort, or be saved from the other evil Slytherins who hate her.
2. Daphne is almost always portrayed as a brilliant witch on the level of Hermione or superior if it's a Hermione bashing fic. You never see her written as having a couple of good to great areas, but also weaknesses. She has to be good at /everything/ and super powerful to keep up with Harry.
3. She's almost always portrayed as incredibly beautiful. Rare is the fic where Daphne is anything remotely approaching ordinary.
4. Authors often portray her family accepting Harry instantly and allying with him no matter what the circumstances might be.
5. Harry in Haphne fics is always either Lord!Potter or Indie!Harry which often makes the plot stupidly predictable. He's always super rich and overpowered, and often a "Founders Heir."
6. Marriage contracts need to die in Haphne fics.
7. It's almost always same narrative. Manipulative!Dumbledore, betrayed by Ron and Hermione, and Daphne proving to be superior to both in all ways.
8. Ginny is often bashed and bastardized beyond all in Haphne fics even when it's supposed to be a 'love triangle'

As for why it's popular? Easy. Daphne is just a name on a list, and can be anything the author wants her to be. She has no canon personality or description, and that makes her easy to use for wish fulfillment. Fanon has taken it and run with it, and created a 'standard Daphne' that so many fanfics use as gospel. It's an easy self insert or Mary Sue ship to use, and not a lot of people do it well.
