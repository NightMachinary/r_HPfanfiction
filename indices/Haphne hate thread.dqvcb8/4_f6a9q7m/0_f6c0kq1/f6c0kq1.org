I live in Greengrass Mansion in the countryside. My name is Daphne Greengrass. I'm 16 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I'll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser potion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-Knotgrass facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. Moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective potion.

There is an idea of a Daphne Greengrass. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply /am not there/.
