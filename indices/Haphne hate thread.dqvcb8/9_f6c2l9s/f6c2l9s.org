I like Haphne. But not the common ones.

Currently I'm brainstorming some ideas and one fo them is a Haphne were she is just a shy RAVENCLAW girl with brown/blonde mix of hair.

And she isnt an Ice Queen, she has friends and likes to party, but she values knowledge over everything else. This contrasts to Harry who is quiet and prefers a woman who shows heart.

It's in the early stages but still, the same Haphne is boring soooooooppp
