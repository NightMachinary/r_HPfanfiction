I think just like with any pairing, if you use too many cliches and don't have an even remotely original storyline the pairing can be bad. But IMO there are a lot of quite enjoyable Haphne stories (Importance of Intent, The Mind Arts,...). And to be honest, from time to time I can even enjoy a "Ice Queen" and Lord!Potter story.

The point I'm trying to make is, with the baseline of an attractive pure-blooded slytherin girl paired with Harry can come a lot of interesting stories.
