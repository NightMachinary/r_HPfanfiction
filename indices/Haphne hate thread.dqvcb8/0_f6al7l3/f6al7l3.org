I live in India, where the types of social interaction and public behaviour delineated in pro-Pureblood fics, like in most Haphne ones, are still the reality more often than not, and its nowhere near as romantic as is portrayed here.

Also, Ice Queen/Prince type characters are so very, very boring to me; and if I never read one more fic talking about social masks as if they're real, physical things, it would be too soon.
