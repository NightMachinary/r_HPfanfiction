I think it's popular because a few people did it well in the beginning. But now everyone copies exactly what those first few people did, and they're all so unoriginal that it even makes the originals look bad. The ones that are still interesting to read are the ones where Daphne is just a regular human being, intelligent but not overly so, powerful but not overpowered, and with normal emotions.

I like Daphne as a way of exploring the traditional pureblood society. I like it when aligning herself with Harry is either dangerous and something her entire family has to think about, or her going against her family to do it. But I do not like it when the 'neutral' family immediately jumps onto Harry's side, Harry immediately becomes a political God, and they suddenly have a wizengamot majority to defeat the evil Fumbledork. That's just not interesting, it's stale, and it's overdone.

Harry/Daphne I do like: linkffn(A Champion's New Hope; Ice Cream by Andrius; Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent), and while the rest of the story is a bit dull due to super Harry, the relationship element in linkffn(Honour Thy Blood) isn't too bad.
