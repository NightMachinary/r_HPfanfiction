Stories where Daphne explains to Harry how "pureblood culture works", how Elves need to be slaves or they'll die or such nonsense, how muggleborns (and the Weasleys) are ignorant barbarians who have no clue about Wizarding Britain's real culture, which, of course, is limited to Slytherins, otherwise the author would have to explain how Harry and everyone else in Gryffindor somehow missed learning about the real pureblood culture in four to five years at Hogwarts, and so on.

Basically, drivel about how human rights and modern western values are all filthy bad things that have no place in Wizarding Britain "because magic and pureblood" or something.
