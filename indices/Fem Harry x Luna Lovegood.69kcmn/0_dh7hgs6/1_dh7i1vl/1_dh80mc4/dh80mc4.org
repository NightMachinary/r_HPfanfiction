She's batshit insane and practices all sorts of dark magic. Ridiculously OP with stronger opposition. It's not bad but the whole Voodoo thing gets boring rather quickly IMO. I got through the first part and started the second but the way magic works in that universe put me off. I dislike fics with higher beings in like Death playing a large role, or the fates or whatever the author comes up with so this was simply not my cup of tea.

However, despite disliking the story I have to admit that it was well written and there were no obvious mistakes.
