I only read 1 and 1/5 fic of the series but so far I can say that Harry teases her quite mercilessly while shagging other people during the tournament. The last thing dies down over time but IMO there was too little Luna and too much OP Voodoo magic and borderline satanic rituals. The Luna was good but there was simply too little of her that was not part of some Light/Dark side magic plot that made little sense based on canon magic (Harry getting burned by some white magic jewelry).

I only stuck so far because I was hoping for more Luna but that never really came.

Then I found "The silent world of Cassandra Evans" which is absolutely crack and Harry/Cassandra is even more OP (like in I killed 15 Death Eaters because I can without breaking a sweat) but it is really fun to read. It has a lot of tropes like the mysterious sibling but it has more than one unique twist to these tropes. It is Harry/Susan with Luna/Ginny and Hermione/Harry's half sister in the background. Luna is absolutely gold in the story and it is probably one of the funniest stories in the fandom IMO. The sequel is being updated regularly.
