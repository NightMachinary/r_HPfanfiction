Now its not Fem Harry/Luna Lovegood. But a kind of/maybe/somewhat if you squint similar but all around pretty good fic is Linkffn(Bound With Silver Threads). Its a Lily Luna Potter/Malfoy's daughter fic that encompasses LLP's 3-7 years at Hogwarts and focuses on her relationships from family, friends, and eventually coming to terms with her sexuality. Malfoy's daughter (Scorpius' little sister) in it is a little withdrawn not quite spacey like Luna but am alright character.
