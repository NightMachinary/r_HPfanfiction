  Lily Luna Potter years 3-7. Why is she stuck with a Little Malfoy tag-along? What do the coming years hold for them and everyone else? How will they change and grow, what will happen as they do, & who will end up with whom? Eventual femslash. Multiple pairings. Lily/OC. Also stars Scorpius Malfoy's OC little sister. Not T until Chap 29, really not until Chap 32 & nothing too major.
