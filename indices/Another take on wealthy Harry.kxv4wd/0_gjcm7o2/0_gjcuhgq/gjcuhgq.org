Yeah, I was kind of hoping to avoid inherited political clout and special abilities, etc. It's just that the premise, to me, kind of makes sense. People who lost their own heirs in the war leaving everything to the one who ended the war. People wondering how their little hero is doing when he's living away from the magical world and the limelight and sending Harry gifts for birthdays or other notable dates (holidays? maybe the anniversary of Voldemort's defeat / his parents' deaths, etc), leaving him smaller bequeaths in their wills to show their appreciation.
