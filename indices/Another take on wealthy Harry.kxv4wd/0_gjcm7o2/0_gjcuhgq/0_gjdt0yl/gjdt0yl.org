It definitely does make sense that that might happen. The problem is that it's hard to build a story off of that idea. Inheriting a bunch of money doesn't exactly kick off a plot when the character in question is already rich. Especially since he didn't do much with his money in canon to begin with. Inheriting more than just money, like artifacts and titles, gives more plot hooks to work with, but then we're right back to where we started with the cliches. I think that at best, it's an idea that can be included as a minor detail in a story, but won't really have any effect.

I know I have also seen a few stories where Harry gets ahold of all the mail he should have received since Voldemort's first death. That does give a bit more to work with, but I think that it tends to be, at best, another way to bash Dumbledore and show that Harry is nice.

Ultimately, the problem is that any story that you could derive from this premise could also work just as easily with Harry inheriting from his parents, the Peverells, or any other ancestors you want to give him, and that's how pretty much everyone chooses to write those stories.

Maybe there could be a story where someone (and it would probably be Dumbledore, because that's how these stories always go) is able to take control of the Potter vault, but not the money that was left specifically to Harry. Or maybe your typical Potter twin WBWL story where James and Lily cut Harry from the family and leave him with nothing, but a bunch of money was left to "the defeater of Voldemort" instead of to the other twin by name, so Harry still gets rich. But in both cases, the fact that inheritance happens pretty automatically makes it a bad solution narratively, so Harry's presumed poverty is immediately invalidated as a problem, and you're basically left with nothing but extra bashing fuel.
