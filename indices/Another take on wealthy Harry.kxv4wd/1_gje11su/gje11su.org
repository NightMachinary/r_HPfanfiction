I am unaware of whether there is a specific law in Britain, but as far as I'm aware, in commonwealth countries, if an offence is committed, money taken is imposed as a penalty or fine, and paid to the state not the victim.

Also that in the event an individual who has committed offences against the state is deceased, then his charges and liabilities die with him and cannot be taken up against his heirs, so it isn't allowed by the government to confiscate the property and money.

I'm not too sure about Economic offences but I think it might apply there as well, because I haven't come across an instance where a deceased debtor's estate was auctioned off or confiscated in a commonwealth country, in my limited experience.

So is it actually possible in Britain to confiscate property and wealth like that? I'm just asking for clarification.
