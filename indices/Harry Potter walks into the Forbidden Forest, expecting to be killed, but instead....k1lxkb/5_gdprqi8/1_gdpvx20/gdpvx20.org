Lucius, instead of going Muggle Baiting, went to Muggle Salons. He hated that there wasn't a Wizarding version, but it was a price to pay to look that good, and he always hoped that Voldemort would follow his original dream again one day, Lucius never believed in the World Domination gig, he just went along with it because the Horcruxes made Voldemort dangerous to his own side too, he just wanted to truly be Luscious Malfoy.
