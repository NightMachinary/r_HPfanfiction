  Bartemius Jr joined the dark lord because his father wasn't taking care of his hair at all, he didn't even comb it, just put a hat on and never took it off, and it was driving the boy insane!

False. Barty Jr joined him because of his father's insistence that he grow a toothbrush mustache like his old man. How gauche.
