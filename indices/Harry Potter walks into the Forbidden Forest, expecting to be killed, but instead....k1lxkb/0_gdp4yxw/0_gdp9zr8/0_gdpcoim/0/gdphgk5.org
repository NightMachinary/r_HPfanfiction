Voldemort just wanted to ask Lily how she had kept her hair so smooth, silky and vibrant! It was disappointing that all that work to try and find her place of residence so he could question her went down the drain when he went berserk at the sight of James Potter's hair and ended up killing them both.

Severus had always wanted to join the Dark Lord, because he was possibly the /only/ one who knew a way to get the damn grease out of his hair, too bad he had died before he could cash in on the appointment he was owed after reporting the prophecy to him.

Voldemort has repeatedly tried to recruit the elderly Potters so he could get the secret recipe for Sleakeazy's hair potion, something that would speed up his work immensely (for all that their son was an idiot for never using it)!

Pettigrew returned to his master as his fears were becoming reality, he was slowly going bald! He could only hope that the Dark Lord knew what to do to help him.

Bartemius Jr joined the dark lord because his father wasn't taking care of his hair at /all/, he didn't even comb it, just put a hat on and never took it off, and it was driving the boy insane!
