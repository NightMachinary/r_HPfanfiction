"your eyes are the sound of rain" "Her face had the fragrance of a gibbous moon"

listen, I'm fond of the flowery metaphors myself, but they should at least be comprehensible. At least avada orbs tells us Harry's eyes are green(wrong shade though, iirc.) If your eyes are "hard as amethyst" or "the sound of rain," then that tells us absolutely nothing about what they look like. It seriously sounds like the person describing this woman was tripping on acid with all the mismatched sensory metaphors.
