Okay, so the problem with your request is its so /broad/, I cannot really get narrow that down so easily. Moreover, good fanfiction is really subjective, and will depend on your tastes. So I will limit this by these conditions: over 100k words, older than five years since publication, less commonly recommended, decent or better writing, and nothing obscene or strange. I will also give a wide range of fics with different foci/interests in hopes something sparks your interest:

- linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent): ahh nostalgia. This was a pre-OOTP fic that truly tells its own story. I love so much of this fic because its very original and while the writing isn't especially memorable, its written well enough that its unnoticeable. Highly recommend, even incomplete it actually ends with the majority of the major story arcs tied up.
- linkffn(Feathers, Fangs and Flames by Nauro): a bit of a canon-retread, but it honestly is the most balanced depiction of Harry becoming a werewolf that I have encountered in the fandom (for an unbalanced one, look up Were's Harry?). Also, not many fics have a decent Harry/Cho pairing, but this one handles it fairly adroitly.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero): and its sequels. These started as a pre-HBP series, but quickly spiraled out into a Harry becomes OP extravaganza that as gripping as it is epic. As a teaser, at one point Harry charbroils a pair of Nundu's to death after fighting them in his animagus form.
- linkffn(Dagger and Rose): one of the few (not to mention good), post-PoA fics out there, basically has Harry being mentored by Dumbledore. Also throws in a Harry/Fleur pairing if thats your thing.

There are more, I am just giving a few examples. You might want to specify though what you're looking for in fanfiction.
