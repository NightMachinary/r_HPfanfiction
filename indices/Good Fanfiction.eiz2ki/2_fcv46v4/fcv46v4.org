Here are some long fics that Imo are well written. Hopefully there are some in here you haven't read before and will enjoy. :)

My first two recs won't work with the bot, so I'll put them first. They are also old fics and were written before the series was finished! Despite that they hold up really well, and I highly recommend them! [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2339&chapno=1]] and [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2681&chapno=1]]

*Shifts* and *Shades* by Fernwithy are Remus/Tonks fics from their POVs and are about what the Order was up to during OotP and HBP. Their summaries are-

#+begin_quote
  During the year of "Order of the Phoenix," Remus Lupin is assigned to protect Dudley Dursley by posing as a teacher at Smeltings.

  With the wizarding world at war, Nymphadora Tonks and Remus Lupin find themselves separated and facing a world with no masks left to hide behind. Alternative point of view of Half-Blood Prince; sequel to Shifts.

linkao3(1038392) *Teddy Lupin and the Forest Guard* is essentially a sequel to Shifts and Shades. It's the first in a four part series about Teddy's time at Hogwarts and the growing pains of the Wizarding World post war. Imo this an excellent series, though heads up its old enough that it doesn't match up with info from Pottermore, so Teddy is in Gryffindor, not Hufflepuff.

linkao3(11083359) *Vera Verto* is about Professor McGonagall post the Battle of Hogwarts as she tries to fix damage to the castle, with romance thrown into the mix.

linkao3(14074770) *In the language of flowers* is an AU where Petunia is a witch and Lily is a muggle. Petunia/Sirius pairing, which works far better than you'd think.

linkao3(7331278) *Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run* is an AU where Harry doesn't find out about magic until he's 17. Harry/Draco

linkao3(20097676) *My Sun Sets to Rise* where Sirius has a preview of other realities after he falls through the Veil. Sirius/Remus

linkao3(373224) *Raindrops on Roses* is a NextGen fic about Albus', Rose's, and Scorpius' time at Hogwarts. Rose/Scorpius.

linkao3(7549384) *Sunshine in My Eyes* is an AU where Minerva raises Petunia and Lily. James/Lily

linkao3(12424344) *Grey Space* is an AU where Hogwarts doesn't start until students are 14.

linkao3(15687453) *proof* is a fic about Harry recovering from the war and baking bread.

linkao3(13912332) *sleeper* is a fic where Harry dreams of a different reality and it starts bleeding into his.

linkao3(6623293) *Realignment* is an AU set while Tom Riddle is at Hogwarts, and a strange man is trying to kill him.

linkffn(12181042) *Order of Mercy* is about the group Fleur, Bill, Percy, and Audrey run during DH to help muggleborns and their families escape from the Ministry.
