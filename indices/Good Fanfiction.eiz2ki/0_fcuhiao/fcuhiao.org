I mean, that's a super hard question to answer since people's idea of quality differs and fanfic has been around for for probably close to 20 years at this point. But I will recommend the Dangerverse that begins with linkffn(Living with Danger by Whydoyouneedtoknow). It's a little tropey but avoids major pitfalls in my opinion.
