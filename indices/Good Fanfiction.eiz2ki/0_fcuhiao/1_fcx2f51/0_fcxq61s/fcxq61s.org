Harry is rescued from the Dursleys at 2ish and raised by Sirius and Remus and their wives. As the author puts it somewhere else, the bad guys' aims are mostly the same but how Harry, who grew up in a loving family and who has a major support system, reacts is different. Minor bad guys such as Umbridge and Malfoy have longer arcs because the stories begin earlier than in canon. The OC's get fleshed out and have their own arcs interwoven into the larger story. There is a major expansion of the magical world in this universe in the way that was often done before Pottermore and all the interviews JKR gave. Magic is still magical but does have some limits and consequences.
