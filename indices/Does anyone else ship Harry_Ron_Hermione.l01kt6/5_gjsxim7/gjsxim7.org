I love this pairing-

As for fics, almost all of the ones i know are oneshots, but they're all pretty good-

1.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9191315/chapters/20857637][tell me whether he is dead]] :

#+begin_quote
  Harry suffers a few side effects from dying but not dying.

  "Hey, can someone help me with this? The mirror in the bedroom's stopped working for me."

  “What do you mean ‘the mirror's stopped working'?”

This can be read as Harry/Hermione/Ron (as it was written) or as a platonic trio friendship fic.

  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.

  “We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”

  With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses.

#+begin_quote
  Lavender keeps asking nosy questions and rumors have reached Harry's ears.

  "Don't you ever want to make other friends? Don't you ever get tired of them?"

  How can you grow tired of people who are your everything?

  A short, sweet getting together fic.
