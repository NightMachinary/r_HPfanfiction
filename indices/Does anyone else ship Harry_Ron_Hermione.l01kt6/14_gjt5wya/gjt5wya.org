No, for two reasons. I can't see Ron and Hermione lasting for more than a weekend. Other than Harry and fighting Death Eaters, they have nothing in common, no shared interests and are pretty opposite of each other personality wise. Opposites attract, hence the weekend I give them, but you need more common ground to build a relationship on. And their previous interactions (especially books 3,4 and 6) would not help with making them a couple.

Secondly, I don't see Ron settling down for a relationship after the war. He now is a war hero, famous in his own regard. He achieved something his brothers did not. And since he made it, he reached his dream, he will live it. VIP invitations, picking up a different fan girl each weekend, big parties, a Quidditch career based on his fame. And not only does the whole sleeping around thing prevent a serious relationship, I also see him as the only trio member who embraces that fame. Hermione might use it occasionally for the sake of reform, but Ron will live that life, and I don't blame him for it the slightest.
