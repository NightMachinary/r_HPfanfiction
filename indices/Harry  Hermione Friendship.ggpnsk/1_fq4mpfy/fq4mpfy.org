Ah what a hard prompt, I really am racking my brain for stories that fit this.

Old Soldiers Never Die - linkffn(2784825) - A story good story of the two teaming up to take on Voldemort. The story treats to two as being best of friends but there are some undertones that implies more.

On An Island In The Sun - linkffn(9279255) - Another story done by the same author that has the two planning on how to make their own country.

Dancing in the Green - linkffn(11703507) - Harry and Hermione are also good friends in the story.

Amicus Protectio Fortis - linkffn(11547735) - There are a lot of moments in this story where the two work and banter together. Fair warning, good chance it is abandoned which is a great shame. I still highly recommend it.

These stories are the best I could think of. Hope, there is something here that you are looking for.
