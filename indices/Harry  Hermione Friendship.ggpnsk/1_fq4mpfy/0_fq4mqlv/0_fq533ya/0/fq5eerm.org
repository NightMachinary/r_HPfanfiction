If it was undertones like in Stages Of Hope (which honestly, was amazing) then it's fine, just meant they shouldn't be pining after each other constantly in the story, if that makes sense? I do actually love Harmony stories, was just in the mood to read friendship rather than romance.. but these all look to be worth the read!
