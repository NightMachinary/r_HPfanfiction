For me, my ideal read would basically be canon, but with a few changes. I'd like to see more of the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore. I'd like to see Harry be taught more by Dumbledore ( Harry suddenly being this absolute master at the end of book six seems a little odd) about magic and things like that - if only to explore magic as a concept further. I'd like to see more development of Ginny as a character and her relationship with Harry. It seems a touch rushed, which I understand was JKR's attempt to convey young love, but I feel I'd like to know a bit more about her. I'd like to see more of Harry's relationship with Sirius, and how that affects him.

My completely different ideal fic, is a Harry/Ginny fic where Harry is brought up by Sirius as his fathers son, ie a bit of a womaniser, strong willed, gets into a bit of trouble, etc., and also gets a bit more training. Basically, I want to see the progression of Harry so I can believe he is capable of holding his own against Voldemort, rather than it just kinda happening.
