My interpretations of canon magic is that JKR had the most important parts as conceptual- "meaning" the unforgivables, the power of love, dementors as depression, the story of death and noble sacrifice, etc. If the students are writing multiple feet on a spell for homework, it's clear that there's a lot we don't know about that JKR glossed over for just regular spells.

I think it's well within the bounds of canon for Harry to just get better because he's taking classes- we generally see no more than 3 sessions of any class for a given year, and even the end of year exams are brief (unimportant) in the grand scheme of the story. Dumbledore is leagues better at magic than Harry and doesn't really need to teach Harry anything more than what Hogwarts already prepares him for, but does need to teach Harry to understand Voldemort. Hermione uses defensive spells to protect the campsite in DH, but those could very well be standard NEWT/post-OWL level charms. Hogwarts may not explicitly cover making new spells, considering the creativity required, but it's fair to say that they indirectly teach the foundations for it if Snape's inventing multiple spells when he's 15/16
