At the end of book 7, it wasn't dueling skills that let him take down Voldemort. It's all conceptual.

Magic has its own rules but is largely dependent on intent rather than specific spells (i.e. Tonks packing Harry's stuff by saying "Pack" with a wave of her wand at the beginning of OOTP). Accepting that basic premise of selfless sacrifice (walking to his death without fighting back) borne out of love providing protection, it's clear that JKR is attempting to evoke the results of heroism. While the Horcrux ritual is said to have something to it beyond just killing, according to JKR interviews, there's no indication that the magic that protected Harry involved any of the common fanfiction tropes- blood magic, soul magic, etc. There's also the interpretation that Harry survived because Voldemort took his blood for the reincarnation. He won his final duel because he was the master of the Elder wand, even if he never claimed it himself, resulting in Voldemort killing himself with his own spell once more. In any case, Harry didn't beat Voldemort because of anything he studied. In canon, it was always due to a set of circumstances that goes beyond standard rules of magic.

If you're familiar with the Nasuverse, or really many other fantasy universes, this isn't uncommon. Voldemort is intended to be evil with no remorse, no redeeming quality explaining it. I really don't how JKR treats him as already evil at the age of 10, but it's not uncommon in literature to have a villain who is naturally evil, especially when the original backbone of HP is a fairy story. In fanfic, some of my favorite stories involved a more realistic descent into darkness, but in canon, it's largely glossed over for a reason.

Finally, Harry is a hero, but he's not pure- he's cast the imperius, the cruciatus, etc. However, his overall inner good and final sacrifice still protect those that he's fighting for.

^{On a slightly related note, I'm actually not even sure what the trio were even doing once Ron left.}

Edit: That's not to say I don't like fics where Harry can actually match up to Voldemort. Although I've come to dislike "magical core" fics, I do like the concept of . However, canonically, that's not what is required for Harry to fight Voldemort. That's why one of the fics I recently read that I really loved was the H-Hr-N-L fic where they go to an AU Hogwarts after an accident in the Lestrange Vault, where Severus, Remus, and Lily are friends and professors in the AU Hogwarts, Harry was never born, Neville died at the end of AU GoF, and the Malfoys are among the Order and leaders of the fight against Voldemort. In it, Luna and Dumbledore both hint at how the end doesn't come from clever stratagems or learning powerful spells, but from the larger concept of intended self-sacrifice.
