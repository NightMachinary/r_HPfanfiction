I think I understand what you're saying, but to me t doesn't quite add up. At the end of a year out of school, not being taught, so he has the skills of a 6th year, he manages to at the very least hold his own against a wizard who is described as one of the most powerful dark wizards of all time. He gets taken down easily by snape at the end of book six, yet at the end of book 7, a mere year later, he manages to defeat Snape's master. While it could have been that Harry was reading books, or whatever, some explicit mention would be better. It somewhat ruins the end of the books for me, as it completely kills my suspension of disbelief in that final battle.
