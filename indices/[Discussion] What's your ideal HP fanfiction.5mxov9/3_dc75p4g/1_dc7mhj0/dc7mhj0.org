  My completely different ideal fic, is a Harry/Ginny fic where Harry is brought up by Sirius as his fathers son, ie a bit of a womaniser, strong willed, gets into a bit of trouble, etc., and also gets a bit more training. Basically, I want to see the progression of Harry so I can believe he is capable of holding his own against Voldemort, rather than it just kinda happening.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128465][Ginny Duty]] is fairly close to what you want, but it's a postwar fic.

"The Dark Lord Never Died", linkffn(11773877), is probably even closer to that setting, but Harry and Ginny are not the main characters.
