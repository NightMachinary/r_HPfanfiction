I like romantic fics in which you see Harry starting a relationship with a girl. Good storybuilding is necessary because otherwise it becomes very cheesy and boring. I also like a bit of action but that's not a must for me. I just read Contractual Invalidation, linkffn(11697407) which is a HP/Daphne Greengrass fic. The story is good, doesn't get stale and is mainly focussed on the romance. I wish there were more stories like that.

I also like it when Harry interacts with the muggle world like in Grow Young With Me (linkffn(11111990)). Harry is just Harry, not an OP monster who slaughters everyone and saves the pretty girl. No, just something that can happen in the real world as well.
