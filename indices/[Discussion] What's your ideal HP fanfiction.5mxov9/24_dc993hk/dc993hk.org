I'm a total sucker for Lily/James. I ADORE linkffn(The Life and Times) , as it's a bit more adult and almost grittily realistic for the times in parts, but I also love more silly fics like linkffn(Commentarius) . An in depth retelling of Lily and James' story, right through their battle against the Dark Lord, would be my ideal fic. Something mainly canon compliant, but certainly expanding on their lives.

Ideally a little deeper than your average 'share a dorm, patrol together' fic.
