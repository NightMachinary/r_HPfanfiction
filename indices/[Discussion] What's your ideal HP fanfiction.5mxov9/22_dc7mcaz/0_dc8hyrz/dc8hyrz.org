Completely agree about plot and character voice. The plot can be about almost anything, but if the reader recognizes and cares about the characters and the plot is gripping enough, it will be amazing. Unfortunately, good plots are rather difficult to find. Even some of the most popular fics have mediocre or meandering plots. And yet I read one Hermione/Lucius fic that was so well-written that I believed everything in it was possible.
