  no Harry/Ginny (yeah great, your main protagonist should totally hook up with a non-character for most of the series)

How exactly is Ginny a "non-character"? She is the most prominent girl of around Harry's age in the books after Hermione. Additionally, JKR has included her in the "Big Seven" (along with Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco, Luna and Neville). So that's a pretty high bar to set.

Do you consider Luna (with much less screentime) and Neville (with about the same screentime) to be non-characters as well?
