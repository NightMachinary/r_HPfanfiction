  Do you consider Luna (with much less screentime) and Neville (with about the same screentime) to be non-characters as well?

Yeah well in regards to the original argument yes. I'd have been just as disappointed if Harry suddenly proclaimed his undying love for Luna. You're not really helping your argument if you need to celebrate the fact that Ginny is more of a character than Luna (who only appeared in Book 5).
