I think there are two main things that are most important for me: Character voices and theme.

Character voices: If I can't hear the characters speak when they talk the fic is not going to work. I can deal with some amount of OOC-ness if it is explained in the Author notes (like... Harry didn't live with the Dursley, but was raised by Remus and is smarter because of it), but the "core" of the Character has to be intact. I guess I believe in some form of existentialism like Joss Whedon. Basically this is just a big talk about "nature vs. nurture", but I just can't enjoy a story at all that assumes nurture is all-defining (absolutely loathe brainwashing fics... Harry is raised by Voldemort and becomes a loyal follower). I realize this is a hot button topic, but you are asking a very subjective question. IMHO there's lots of scientific evidence that nature plays a much larger role in development than some people like to believe (because it's a nice fantasy to believe you can make anything out of yourself if you just work hard enough). Okay, I'm going way too far here. In conclusion: Characters are super important, my ideal fic has the core Harry Potter characters in it in a way that I can clearly recognize them. Exploring different avenues and shades of their characters is absolutely okay and interesting.

Theme: Harry Potter for me is about friendship, adventure and a lot of wholesome stuff. My ideal fic is propably a lot more adult than JKRs writing (I like a good amount of sexual references and violence, because that's real life), but I have yet to enjoy a Dark-Gritty type of fic (that vibe belongs to A Song of Ice and Fire). Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love George R. R. Martins writing, but such a bleak world IMHO has no place in a Harry Potter story and a fic that completely abandons the positive attitude of the series doesn't really feel Harry Potter-ish to me.

It's really hard to get that right though, because a lot of fics (like those by popular author Robst) completely abandon all adversity and become pure fluff. If you want to have a story about overcoming obstacles and evil it has to have some amount of conflict and difficulty in the first place. There has to be a low point where all seems to be lost, but then hope instead of despair dominates the story.

I realize I'm talking about very abstract and high concept stuff in this concept, but these things are much more important for my "ideal" fanfic, than more technical things like plot and structure. If you get these two things right you'll probably have a fantastic fic, even if it follows the most basic of plots. This is probably the reason why I love Harry Potter so much, even though a lot of stuff that happens in the canon story is super dumb and ridiculous: "Wait, so you are telling me that there is a magical artifact that can force someone to do basically anything without consent and a murderous Death Eater can so perfectly impersonate a (in)famous Auror known for his paranoia that not even one of the smartest Wizards, Dumbledore, can see through his act for months? Ahh, who cares, I wonder how Harry and his friends will get through this?"

Edit: Oh almost forgot, of course my ideal fic has almost none of the canon pairings. No Remus/Tonks (blech), no Harry/Ginny (yeah great, your main protagonist should totally hook up with a non-character for most of the series) and Ron/Hermione (kill-me-now, this is the worst). Over the years I've noticed that I will read basically any pairing (except Slash, just not into that very much), even though I of course have my preferences, but the canon "Romances" are literally the worst I can come up with (okay, Draco/Hermione propably comes close in awfulness to Ron/Hermione, but I've read one or two convincing post-Hogwarts stories that I actually found more... acceptable than canon; The idea that Hermione would willingly condemn herself to a life with Ron Weasley fills me with a deep sadness and tragic despair... it's not really describable in words... yeah yeah, I'm being overly dramatic, sue me)
