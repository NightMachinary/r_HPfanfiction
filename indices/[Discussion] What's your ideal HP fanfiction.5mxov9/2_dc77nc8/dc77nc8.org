I'd like to see a fanfiction that plays with politics but without Harry being some type of lord. Something where Harry, Hermione, and Ron aren't just fighting against a dark lord, but instead an entire rich pureblood society that looks down on everyone. Perhaps a world where Slytherin was an odd one out for believing that everyone should be taught.

Maybe Hermione gets sent to a lower class school. Not to mention Harry is a bit of a lepper for the lone heir of the Potter clan marrying, and dying for a muggle/muggleborn. The houses would still be considered somewhat in the same light. Gryffindor is consider the best because they're brave. Hufflepuff is for the loyal, but is still looked down upon. Ravenclaw is considred only for the smartest. And Slytherin is for the cunning, but is almost alway full of half-bloods.

Basically I want something that actually tries to make the "Dumbledoor is evil, and Voldemort is good" trope actually work. Of course it'd be something a bit more Grey with Voldemort's group still basically being "Magical Terrorist" just witha good cause.
