  I'd like to see a fanfiction that plays with politics but without Harry being some type of lord. Something where Harry, Hermione, and Ron aren't just fighting against a dark lord, but instead an entire rich pureblood society that looks down on everyone. Perhaps a world where Slytherin was an odd one out for believing that everyone should be taught.

That's basically what "The Sum of Their Parts", linkffn(11858167), is about, although that fic took place after the events in DH.
