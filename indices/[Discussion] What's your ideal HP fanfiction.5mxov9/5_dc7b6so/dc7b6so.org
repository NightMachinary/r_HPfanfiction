My go-to fics are Harry/Ginny post war angsty stuff and my ideal fic is actually a combination of 4 or 5 actual fics already written, with each fic getting about 80% there to what I consider "ideal."

Ultimately I want a story that shows the impact the war would have on the relationships of the characters. I also like when the Harry/Ginny relationship is consistent with the tone Rowling set out in the books. They go great together but this is a realistic relationship prone to typical relationship issues and not some "we know we'll be together forever from the first time we kissed" relationship. As such, my ideal fic has the couple struggling to deal with not seeing each other while Ginny is away. They both get a little jealous of others hitting on each other, perhaps Harry isn't writing as much as he should, and Ginny equally focuses too much on Quidditch and NEWTs.

There is enough in canon to suggest these two could have some issues with communicating, jealousy, and having career ambitions conflict with the relationship.

I would like a fic where eventually one or the other, preferably Ginny, to break it off due to the stress of not seeing each other. Neither wants to date someone else but are convinced by friends to get back out there. Let's say Ginny breaks it off, and is convinced to try and go on a date with the guy who has been flirting with her all year, and she finds that while the date is technically great and she should like this guy, she just can't because Harry is the one for her and always has been. It's cliche and sappy, but what can I say, I'm a sucker for that stuff.

Or, I also find I enjoy fics where an ex of Ginny or Harry try to cause problems (unsuccessfully). While canonically, I doubt Dean would try to steal Ginny from Harry, I also don't think Ginny and Dean would be good friends and Dean would be totally cool with her and Harry. I like the idea of Dean trying to win her back while he is at school with Ginny and Harry is away. I read a story like that which was almost exactly what I'd want in that plot line.

And another: I liked a story I read where Neville was kinda Ginny's best friend because of their shared experiences that last year, and he falls in love with her and gets weird. My ideal fic could potentially use that plot line, or at least go into how Neville and Ginny share something that her and Harry don't, and how Harry feels about that. Perhaps Ginny could talk about how she envied the relationship Harry has with Ron and Hermione and is insecure about never being on their level of closeness.

While this is going on, there is a separate side story involving the uprooting of corruption in the Ministry. Harry and Ron are heavily involved. I just think changing the way the Ministry runs is a huge and necessary lift. I always thought it interesting that Rowling said Lucius Malfoy got away with everything again, which shows that the Ministry is still as corrupt as ever.
