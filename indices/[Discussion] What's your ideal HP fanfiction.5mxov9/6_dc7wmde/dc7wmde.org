Centred on indy Harry with mentor Dumbledore (and loyal Ron if he's involved at all) going up against competent and evil Voldemort. Preferably Harry paired with a girl who isn't Hermione, Ginny or Luna. A lot of magically magic and less of a gunfight style of duelling. Hopefully Hermione isn't in the story or has minimal effect and dies horribly because of her devotion to rules or authority figures.

Decent amount of humour and light-heartedness, with minimal angst.
