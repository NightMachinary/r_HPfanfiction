I would love to see a non-Harry-centric, Hogwarts-era fic. (Could be AU, PoD or a canon retelling--I'm not all that picky.)

I feel like Rowling has already told Harry's story. All these Slytherin!Harry, Genius!Harry, Disabled!Harry stories are cool, but Harry Potter himself feels more like a burden than a boon, as the author is forced to work around Rowling's plot and characterisation.

Also, I favour more nuanced interpretations of unsympathetic characters, such as Malfoy, Snape, Pansy and Lockhart. Yes, Draco's a whiny little bitch, but some of my best friends have been whiny little bitches--he doesn't always have to be antagonistic.

(Basically, I just want more /Applied Cultural Antropology/.)
