Sure, but I'd argue those are more in the vein of fixfics, creating deliberate contrasts and parallels to canon. I do enjoy those from time to time, but if you want to explore a particular aspect of Potterverse (e.g. Hufflepuff house, science vs magic), you're much better served with a different main character.

I suppose you could go completely AU , so that Harry is no longer recognisable as his canon self (HPBWL comes to mind). But at that point you may as well be honest and go with an OC. Sadly, OC fics just aren't as widely read.
