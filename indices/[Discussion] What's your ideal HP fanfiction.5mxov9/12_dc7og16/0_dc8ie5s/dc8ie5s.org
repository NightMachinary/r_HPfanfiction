  Basically, I just want more /Applied Cultural Antropology/.
#+end_quote

In-depth explorations of non-Harry characters in other houses would be fantastic. There are a few out there, but nothing really on the same level as /Anthropology/.

  Also, I favour more nuanced interpretations of unsympathetic characters, such as Malfoy, Snape, Pansy and Lockhart.
#+end_quote

So do I, and that's why white-washing in fics is a complete disservice to the audience. It's perfectly fine for characters to be awful and unlikeable -- and it makes for a more satisfying read when they show another facet of themselves.
