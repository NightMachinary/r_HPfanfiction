Well, I'm not too sure how popular this kind of opinion is, but my Ideal ff should stick pretty close to canon, while also expanding on it, without blowing it our of proportion. I am a sucker for the "Magic A is Magic A" trope, so I like fics that get a bit technical but without losing the magic of, well, Magic.

I'm a diehard H/Hr shipper, but I can work with most ships that are *well developed and not rushed*. This means that if a relationship is to be a part of the story, it should be done slowly and carefully.

I also /absolutely despise/ bashing. To me its presence in a story is the mark of a bad author, and I completely refuse to read stories that feature it. This is the same with "Evil, manipulative Dumbledore" fics, which could be interesting if the premise wasn't so overused everywhere on FF.net.

All in all, my ideal fic would be a 6th year canon compliant H/Hr pairing with a bit more of screentime for the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore. And Ron, more Ron is always good (When he is well written).
