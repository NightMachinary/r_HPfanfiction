Well, let's make a list - shall we? ;)

Main Character: Harry (all the way, I like one shots about others, but long stories? Far and in between)

Genre: Gen or Romance (and long, with a decent plot)

Writing style: Like in the books themselves!

Plot: A true heroes journey, no deconstructing/ruining the hero (like - IMHO - Rowling did in her last book when she made Harry even more clueless and kind of lost!). More cool magic, some learning/training, some sense of wounder (Harry not being a damned lazy fool) with Harry being interested in certain magic fields (whatever they may be) but not a slouch in others etc. exploration of the world outside of Britain (also a fave of mine!) and magics that Hogwarts does not teach (how about Vodoo or Blood-Magic etc.) :) No lazy pushover Harry (that's why I hate canon Harry, he never really stands up for himself, he's too busy feeling sorry for himself a lot of the time! "I want to be just Harry"...) Politics are always great (if well written - Harry walking all over Dumbledore is amusing sometimes, but not very realistic IMHO!) No rushed relationships, no crappylogue (sorry, but I hate the Harry/Ginny ship and I hate Hermione/Ron even more, mostly because I hate Ron (bad friend and useless IMHO - I say this despite the downvotes I'll get for disliking a fan-favorite!)), no putting Hermione on a pedestal (she ain't so great IMHO, she's not a new Dumbledore or Voldemort - she's a great and intelligent student, but not a prodigy!) etc. etc. :)
