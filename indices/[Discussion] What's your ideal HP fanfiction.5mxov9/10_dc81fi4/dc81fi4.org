Non-romantic Hermione fics. Not in the sense that I don't want there to be any romance, but I don't want it to be the main theme. So many Hermione centric fics are Hermione/Someone (usually Draco or Snape for some reason) which really rarely interest me. However, fics where Hermione is tweaked a little bit to take on a more protagonist role, are fantastic to me. I'm really into an author who explores the specifics of magical mechanics, and Hermione is exactly the sort of person who asks those sorts of questions. Lady Archimedes is just about my favorite thing right now.
