A fic where everything gets ramped up to 11, and the consequences of that. Massive wizarding warfare, not skirmishes. Powerful wizards able to level small towns with a single spell, to say nothing of Voldemort. Lots of political intrigue and everybody being massive assholes to each other. Everything is grey, no black or white at all.

Not to mention Harry would also be at the core of it all, but this wouldn't be a super Harry fic. No, everybody else would be elevated to super Harry levels as well. It's like Eliezer Yudkowsky said in one of his guides once: if you give Frodo a lightsaber, you have to give Sauron a Death Star. Let's have Harry's plots crash and burn, his friends killed off and his ass kicked in fights. Let the final, desperate ploy come a hair's breadth away from utter failure. And then let's see him rise from the wreckage, anger burning in his eyes, clothes and skin torn, wand shattered, limbs broken, meeting death head on and then let's see him kill the big bad in a massive duel that on a scale that kills thousands with the fallout.

Let's have a fic about a conflict between two men large and catastrophic enough to be called a war.
