SS/HG is my absolute favorite because of how dynamic their characters are and how they play off one another.

I like my Hermione mature, strong, intelligent, and independent...but flawed. Usually some form of stubbornness, hot-headed, reactive, etc.

My favorite brand of Severus is basically the Byronic hero: acerbic, brooding, snarky, aloof, brilliant, powerful, but inwardly hurting and vulnerable...low self-confidence, guilt-ridden, self-loathing, damaged goods.

I like there being an actual plot around which their slow-burning relationship can build. "The Other Side of Darkness" by Abby is an example. I don't always like fics that are SOLELY about building their relationship (like "Post Tenebras, Lux" by Loten).
