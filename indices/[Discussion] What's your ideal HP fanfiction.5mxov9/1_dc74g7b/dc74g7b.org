Well, I know that no-one else is going to write exactly what I want to read... so I might as well suppose that I would be the writer.

I'd keep the canon myth arc (Harry Potter vs. Voldemort, the self-fulfilling prophecy, etc) but keep the tone more consistent throughout. The early books, written for younger readers, are very incongruous in comparison to the later books, which were naturally meant for a more mature audience that had grown with the series. I get a very real sense that the first few books are like a completely different world from the last few books, and that's always jarred me.

I'd include lots of awesome magical stuff instead of just rehashing canon's magical spells and paraphernalia - part of the charm of JKR's magic, in my eyes, was that there was always something new. Teleportation via /fireplace/!? Flying soul-sucking zombies and animal guardian spirits!? Disembodied brains with memory-tentacles!? Sweet!

For that matter, I'd also like to explore some of the underlying metaphysics of the 'verse - why and how does magic work? Is there really an afterlife, as implied? What is the afterlife like? Where did magic come from, who were the first wizards?

Also, I'd include femslash, to pander to my lesbian ass. Because I'm trash.
