Femslash political/action fic with a proactive, idealistic main character and a love interest with her own life and goals. I'd also like it to be well-written, as most HP femslash is not. Hermione's personality drives me up the wall, so while I'd be happy with her as a central character to drive the plot, I wouldn't want her to be involved in the central pairing. (Ginny's snark and absolute, furious insistence on people respecting her and her boundaries is much more attractive to me.)
