No, the British Ministry was by magnitudes worse.

The US government has its faults, but it's still better compared to the great majority of Muggle governments in the world, who are in turn still a lot better than the British Ministry of Magic.

The fact it was using soul-sucking monsters to torture minor criminal offenders should tell you how bad it was. In addition, this government was utterly ineffective against genocidal and ruthless terrorists.

Now look at the US, it had made lots of mistakes, big ones even, but it had established one of first world's constitutional republic; freed its own slaves; overcame (or tried to) its racism; defeated one genocidal maniac; stood up to two other totalitarian monsters; and let humanity to unprecedented improvement in living standards. Before you think how miserable your country is, take a look at history and find out how badly it sucked back then! Also, look around in other countries and find out how many of them are really better of than you.
