I was being a bit tongue in cheek, but you make a valid argument.

That being said, keep in mind that perspective is based on the person. Someone who is in one social bubble of a country is going to see something vastly different from someone in another. So someone who's always been upper-middle class with all of the benefits that come with that upbringing is going to have a /vastly/ different outlook on the state of the government than someone who's hovered right at the poverty line since birth. And maybe you can't make a side by side comparison between the two governments (I'm sure that wizarding Britain has it's bragging points as well), but the US government has a /lot/ to answer for in its failings for certain demographics.

I can love my country while still being honest about its faults, and the USA has a lot of faults. And saying "other people have had it worse!" doesn't really change the fact that it's still pretty bad for some people. That's like telling someone who's just been stabbed "Well at least you weren't shot. Other people are hurt worse than you are." The fact that someone else was hurt worse does not change the experience of the person who was stabbed.

Buuuuut that's probably too heavy a debate to get into in this particular subreddit. :) I was joking for the most part in the original reply.
