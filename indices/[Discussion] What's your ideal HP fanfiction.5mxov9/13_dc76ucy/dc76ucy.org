I'd like to see more well written postwar fics in the style of CIS, House of Cards, and West Wing. It's now canon that Hermione made it to Minister 20 years after the Battle, so how she got there would make an excellent story. Unfortunately, I've yet to see a SINGLE decent fic that addressed her professional career.

I have written [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/598o74/the_fics_that_you_want_to_read_or_write_what_are/d96lnq0/][a plot bunny]] about a postwar 'dark Hermione' scenario before, by using only canon facts. It's probably a too dark interpretation, but I think nevertheless a plausible one, because 20 years is a long time, and politics and power will change people greatly. In addition, Harry was ready to crucio his enemies without a shred of remorse by the end of DH, so he was not a nice person by that point and not the law-abiding 'saint' depicted in so many postwar fics.

Furthermore, I ask all of you who have children these questions:

- If your children had been tortured with the worst spell (or another form) at their school, how would you react?

- If you knew your government/authority was a corrupt and incompetent mess, would you really expect justice to be carried out by such an entity?

- If you fought and captured those monsters at great cost, what would you do? Dragging your children through the mud of 'Wizengamot justice'?
