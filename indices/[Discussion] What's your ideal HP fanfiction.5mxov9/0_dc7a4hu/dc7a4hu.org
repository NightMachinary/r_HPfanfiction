I can't really say what sorts of fanfic I like, because it's a special mix of different things that attracts me.

I like romance, but I don't want it to be overly sappy or mushy. I don't want to be /told/ that these two people are in love because blah blah blah. I want to see it for myself in their subtle gestures and interactions.

I like humor, but I hate most comedy fanfics. Because they just don't feature my sort of humor. My sense of humor is a bit on the dry side and maybe sometimes a bit snarky. I didn't find the pranks the Marauders or Weasley twins played in the books funny, and I particularly don't find it funny in fanfiction. That sort of humor is kind of a drag, to be honest. I like it when characters have witty, somewhat sassy exchanges. Self-deprecating humor is also nice when done well.

As far as this subreddit goes, I seem to be in the minority in that I really dislike the super long fics. It always seems like the author creates all these unneeded subplots and tries to juggle POV from ten different characters when I'd really rather focus on one character's journey.

And lastly, I like fics where the characters understand the concept of "middle ground." Not everything needs to be good or bad, wrong or right. I like when the grey area in between is explored. Like Hermione and her house elf crusade. Good on her for wanting to improve their lot in life. But one thing that's often ignored is you can't just tell them all "you're free" and then leave them to their own devices. That's pretty much what the US did to slaves at the end of the Civil War and over a century later, there are /still/ areas where the descendants of those freed are struggling. Instead of just releasing elves and letting them figure out the rest on their own, why not learn more about the apparently symbiotic relationship they seem to have with Wizards (Dobby appears to be the anomaly, and Winky's reaction is implied to be the more "normal" one in-universe for sudden onset elven freedom). There has to be some way of improving the elves' living conditions without driving them to a drunken depression. The notion that "Slavery is bad, so we're going to end it abruptly and then everything will be okay!" is rather immaturely optimistic.
