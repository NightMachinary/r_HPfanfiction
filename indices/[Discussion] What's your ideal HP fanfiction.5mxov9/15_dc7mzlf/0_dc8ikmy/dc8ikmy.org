  I am getting tired of the same old Hogwarts storyline no matter how it is tweaked

Surely no one tires of reading about Harry's first Diagon Alley shopping trip!

But yeah, I know what you mean. After so many "AUs" where Harry is some sort of almighty Lord Potter with creature heritage or is related to all the Founders of Hogwarts, and yet Dumbledore is /still/ hiding the Stone under the school during first year, I really would like something a bit different.
