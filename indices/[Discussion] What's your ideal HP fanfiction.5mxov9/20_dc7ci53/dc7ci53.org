Two types. I dislike the epilogue but part of it because its so happily ever after. A post war dealling with the trials and Magical britian recovering, the stress of being the man who conquered all while dealing with the deaths. I want to see realism slap Hermione round the face. I call bullshit on her ever making minister without riding Harry's coat tails hard. I can only think of one fic where its pointed out she'd be an awful person to work with. I want this to lead to a fracture in the relationship in the trio as Harry becomes even more closed off than before while Ron and Hermione try and make it work. I've got some notes towards a story where this leads Harry to taking a holiday to discover who he is as a person. Me being me it leads him into Daphne who tears him apart for not using his titles to change what he wants and still moaning.

Alternatively I would love more Harry tutored by Dumbledore. I don't care if the Horcrux dies early or if they aren't even in the story but Harry exploring magic with Dumbledore would be awesome. I would love a story about a Slytherin Harry who when he asks Dumbledore if he has to go back to the Dursleys causes flash backs of Riddle so Dumbledore lets Harry stay at the castle over summer and takes an interest in his education. No Hermione or Ron but focusing on that point where Harry spends too much time with adults to be a child but too young to do much. Draco Malfoy accusing the headmaster of blatant favourtism and being right but who cares? Harry thrives under the watchful eye of Dumbledore and tears apart the triwizard. We watch him chafe under umbridge as his regular pattern is disrupted and Dumbledore has to stop him from interfering and removing her. I want him to be based out of Hogwarts during the war as he and Dumbledore argue about the place of morality in war and what is acceptable.
