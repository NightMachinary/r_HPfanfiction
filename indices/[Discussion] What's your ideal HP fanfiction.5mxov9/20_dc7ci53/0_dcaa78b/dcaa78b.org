Ok, link? I'd love to read that (I like Harry/Slytherin pairings, because they often give him a reality check and make him stop feeling sorry for himself, which otherwise keeps him occupied so that he doesn't ever think about using what he has and standing up for himself!)

I'd read that second concept for a fanfiction you described as well (Dumbledore is kind of a scholar at heart, that's why he's not a great leader - his heart just isn't in it, that's why he makes so many mistakes...well, that and his lack of empathy (a truly empathic person could not have stashed Harry at the Dursleys IMHO!) and believe in the greater good!)
