linkffn(6257522) and linkffn(8303194) are the two closest that I can think of. I'm a fan of the second but not the first as I dislike the characters in the first. That being said I could see someone taking the ideas and rewriting it into something great. The second I think isn't exactly Slytherin Harry but it is mentoring Dumbledore.
