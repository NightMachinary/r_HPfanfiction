General plot: Exploration and Adventure

Main characters: Harry and/or Hermione

Pairings: Luna, Tonks or a very rare one made good.

Beyond that I only want there to be none of the usual Lord Potter-fic crap (him being Lord Potter is alright, just not the cliches) and I'd like there to be no bashing (though making the Weasleys and Dumbledore villains is totally cool - as long as you make them good villains).
