All time favorite list is probably different from what I am looking for now.

At this point I've read so many things, I really go for AU stuff. More authors should branch out like Inverarity with the Quick and Hogwarts House Divided. I can live with stations-of-the-canon rehash, but it better be through the lens of major changes. I wish the fandom community had more ideas for replacement villains. I kinda prefer stories to begin after the Tournament, if only because they can avoid a half dozen chapters rehashing events. At least with WBWL stories there is a different tension than canon.
