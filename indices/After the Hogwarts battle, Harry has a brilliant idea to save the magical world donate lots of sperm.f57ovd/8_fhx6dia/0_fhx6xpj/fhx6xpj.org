Why? Women that use donated sperm want a kid. And I can bet most of them want their kid to be as special as possible, so having a magical child would not be so awful.

However, my ideea was not so much about that part, but most about all the chaos 500 halfbloods raised only muggles would create at Hogwarts: from the delivery of letters (it's HARD to attend so many kids!), to issues with the train (they would need a few more cars!), boats, to how to deal with the sorting (500 sortings would take a lot),etc... to parts where the kids should find out who their brothers are to prevent future incest (That is why it should not be Harry only the donor, but most of his male friends/colleagues). Lots of funny/difficult situations.

Also, If the trend continues the following years... it would completely disrupt the magical world!
