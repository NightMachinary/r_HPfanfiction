  Actually, from what I have read (never been to a sperm donating center), the guy gives a (anonymous) description of himself and I guess many try to make it look good...
#+end_quote

I /think/ the description is just a set of details. What I've been told of the sperm-dad of a friend of mine was: red-head, doctor, tall. What I remember is needed is: hair colour, eye colour, IQ, profession & height (maybe more, but it could also be different in different countries).
