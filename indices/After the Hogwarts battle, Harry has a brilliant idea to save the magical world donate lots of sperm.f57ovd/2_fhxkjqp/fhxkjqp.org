I had a note for a story postscript like that:

- Minerva alerts Harry that Hogwarts is being suffused by a spate of vision-impaired Muggleborns with messy black hair. A bit of investigation and it turns out that fertility clinics across the UK accepted donations from an anonymous contributor. Profile read: "Black hair, green eyes, 5' 11", Twelve stone; might have gone pro rugby but instead joined law-enforcement; IQ 125 and a certain something special." Once this donor's sperm had been used, it became obvious to the clinicians that it was exceptionally fertile stock- every client got pregnant at first try, often with twins. It became the defacto choice for those with IVR difficulties.
