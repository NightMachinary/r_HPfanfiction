This is actually a really good “Greater Good,” reference.

I'm not arguing whether or not it would be a good or a bad thing, but doing something so heinous and widespread, which you KNOW is heinous, but with the hope of it truly creating a better world?

That encapsulates “Greater Good,” a million times better than all the parodies people make of the saying.
