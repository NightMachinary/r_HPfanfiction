  "Tragedy struck today when Anorexia Nervosa claimed a young boy's life," he spoke loudly. "Very sad. He will be missed by one person, maybe two. Awful. Now to the weather with Carl!"Ginny could not help herself; she burst out laughing. She didn't know what was more absurd. The way Malfoy joked about his own death or the fact that he had watched muggle TV. Muggle news even."You're a bloody lunatic!" she snorted, and Malfoy's smile widened."Darling," he said in a posh accent. "We're all bloody lunatics, that's why we're here in the first place." He started to stand up. "Now that you're here, that goes for you too." He began walking away from her, slowly tilting his head as he spoke over his shoulder."Welcome to the loony bin, Weaslette!"
