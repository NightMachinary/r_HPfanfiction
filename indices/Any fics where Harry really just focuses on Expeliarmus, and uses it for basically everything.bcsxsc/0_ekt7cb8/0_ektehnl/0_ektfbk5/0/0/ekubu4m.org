I'm going to take that as a compliment.

Besides, I didn't even mention the part where they both eventually marry Harry with Hermione becoming Lady Potter and Bellatrix becoming Lady Black (obviously).

Harry also defeats Voldy by Expelliarmusing all the horcruxes from their receptacles. This would have normally killed Harry when the horcrux leaves his body but he is protected by Bellatrix and Hermione's love. The love of his other wives Daphne Greengrass (Lady Peverell) and Luna (Lady Ravenclaw) helped as well.
