I'm writing a fic set when Harry is in Auror training, and while he's pretty shit at all the other spells, he uses expelliarmus for everything.

Door blocking the way? Disarm it.

Monster attacking? Disarm it.

Someone on a killing rampage? Disarm them.

Remember in the Goblet of Fire when Dumbledore uses Expelliarmus to break down the door to Moody's room, that the shit Harry is going to do.
