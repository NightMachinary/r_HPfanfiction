Generally, I do it from my browser, because one more tab won't kill me when I already have a bajilion and four open. I do tend to make a .pdf copy for offline reading, which I sometimes use for rereading because why not.

Mind you, my phone is a StupidPhone (as opposed to a SmartPhone), which does limit my ability to read stuff on it and as such I don't have the need to make my reading compatible with it; when that changes, I'll probably start making a copy that works with the stuff too.
