True, I got to around chapter 8 before giving up, because of this reason. But I'm glad I revisited it a few months later, because it gets way better - I think the author took this critique seriously and toned it way down because right after the Sorting, Harry is actually an okay character to read.

I would recc you give it another try and skip past the first chapters, because they're basically throwing shit at Rowling, and you won't really miss much except for an interesting take on Draco's personality and a bunch of foreshadowing. But the rest of it is pretty dang amazing, tbh.
