If you haven't yet, I recommend checking out [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TheDivineComedian/pseuds/TheDivineComedian/works?fandom_id=136512][The Divine Comedian's]] Lupin-centric fics. In particular, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13719279/][Still Life With Skull]] is a well-written exploration of what Lupin might have been thinking/feeling during his ride in on the Hogwarts express in Harry's 3rd year.
