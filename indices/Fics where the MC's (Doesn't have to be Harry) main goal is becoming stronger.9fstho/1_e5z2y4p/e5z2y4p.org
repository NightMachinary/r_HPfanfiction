Here we go:

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by the Santi): Harry really only wants to become better at magic

Linkffn(The Mind Arts): similar to the above but strong here is on a much higher scale

Linkffn(on the way to greatness by Mira mirth): sort of, but it really starts in 4th year.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge): Harry gears up to fight Voldemort, with some backup too.

Linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) has Harry working to beat out his competition, only getting more competitive as time passes.

Linkffn(Champion's New Hope): Harry decides to up his game to take on Voldemort, trains like crazy. Not the best, but this one is actually completed.
