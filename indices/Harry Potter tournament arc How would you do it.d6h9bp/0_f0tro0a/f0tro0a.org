The problem is that a fighting tournament usually needs a lot of convoluted plot devices to make it viable in any non-sports story. In Harry Potter, you need to think of a very good reason why people who have been fighting in an actual, lethal conflict since first year would care much about a tournament - and why there would be charater growth there, and not in actual adventures and fights. And a lot of what would make the tournament viable as a plot is already used for the Tri-Wizard Tournament.

So, my idea would be: Use the TWT, and make it a Tri-School Tournament, perhaps with a great prize or something, or the "sabotage, forced to compete" canon plot device.

Alternatively, replace Quidditch with duelling as the spotlight sport. See Harry, Ron and Hermione face Draco and the other Slytherin scum every year and weather cheating, assassination attempts, and sabotage.
