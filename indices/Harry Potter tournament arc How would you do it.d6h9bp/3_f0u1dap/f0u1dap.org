The thing is, magical combat in HP is pretty straight-forward unless you are at least on a McGonagall level of competency and therefore quite boring, especially if you take schoolchildren as contestants. I have read quite a few duelling tournaments and frankly, they all sucked. They either needlessly drag on despite the result being plainly visible from round 1 (Harry wins) or don't get the audience invested in the MC winning. Who cares if they win some trophy? And any reason short of "bread and games" feels incredibly forces (eg needing the prize money for something vital) and in case of a dystopian world with gladiators, the tournament would only be the cover for the main plot, namely overthrowing the dictatorship which makes them fight.
