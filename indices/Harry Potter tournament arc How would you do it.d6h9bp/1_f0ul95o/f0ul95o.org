So, Incubus by SquareRootBeer actually had a dueling tournament as part of the Triwizard tournament and I thought it did a decent job of an anime-style fighting tournament, where fighters were differentiated according to their nature (Ron fights tactically, Hermione purposely drags out her fight to learn spells from her opponent, etc) but it's not very long overall and it's definitely just window dressing to move the smut along.

I'd link it, but I think it was just recently taken off FFN? And it'd violate sub rules regardless, due to underage content.
