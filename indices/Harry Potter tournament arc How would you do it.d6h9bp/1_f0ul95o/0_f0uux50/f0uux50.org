This reminded me of linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) by jbern where the author incorporated duels and other events into the Triwizard Tournament. There were some stereotyping going on--Durmstrang students being more prone to Dark spells, etc--but the duels were fast-paced and there were clear differing styles.

Plus the Sorting Hat is the sassiest entity known to mankind, which is always a plus.
