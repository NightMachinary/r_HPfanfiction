I like character driven plots, I'm a greedy bastard. Having one or the other is nice but I want it all. Without a good plot I'm bored because nothing is happening but without good characters I don't care what's happening because there are no emotional stakes and I'm not invested.

That being said I read Harry Potter fan fiction because I like the characters and the world, so my scrutiny on the characters is actually higher than in other genres. If someone is behaving out of character it better be justified in the story somehow or I'll be annoyed.
