I didn't realize how much I cared about character development, and how little I cared about plot, until I joined a book club (for normal fiction, not fanfic). People would talk about how they were bored by a story and kept waiting for something interesting to happen, and I'd be like, "...are you kidding? I could not put this book down, and I cried when it was over."

I really love that feeling of getting attached to a protagonist, getting in their head and watching their life and their relationships change in interesting ways. Does that sentence even make sense? Whenever I try to articulate what I like about a character-driven story, it always comes out as overly poetic nonsense, like: "I like stories that say something interesting about what it means to be human." But I know I can't be alone, because that's the point of so many good books, movies and plays.

I think that's why I enjoy Marauders stories so much. I always wanted to spend time with these fun, funny, smart, tragic characters who we just got to briefly glimpse in the HP books. I don't really need an overly complicated plot to enjoy a good story.
