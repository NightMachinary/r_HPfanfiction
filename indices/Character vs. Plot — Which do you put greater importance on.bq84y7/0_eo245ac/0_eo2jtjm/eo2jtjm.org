I've never been big on movies, always preferring TV and books, since it allows time to know characters. I often have a hard time coming to like new characters, so a feature length movie isn't always enough to get me emotionally invested. I think a big part of enjoying FF is that I already have an emotional connection to characters when the story begins.
