Agreed. Good plot emerges naturally from the characters, and concludes in a way that draws the characters' arcs to a satisfying close.

Speaking in general terms to avoid spoilers, this is why so many people are disappointed by season 8 of Game of Thrones. The plot has become divorced from the characters such that it feels like the writers are moving the characters around the board, rather than characters doing things for reasons which make sense within their character arcs.
