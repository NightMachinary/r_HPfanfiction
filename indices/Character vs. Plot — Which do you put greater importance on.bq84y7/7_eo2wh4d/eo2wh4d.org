Character and style come first, plot runs a distant third. Don't get me wrong, plot is fantastic when the writer knows what they're doing. But I'm here for the characters and the magic, and I get a particular thrill out of stylistic brilliance - which doesn't necessarily mean pyrotechnics or complex prose. It can be quiet and insightful and full of perfect turns of phrase. Plot is no substitute for those particular pleasures. Plus I've tried too many books and fics that, yes, kept me reading all the way to the end because the author was a whiz at pacing and reasonably clever in their plotting. More often than not, the stories leave me unsatisfied and feeling like I've just consumed a bunch of empty calories. I generally don't pick up another work by those authors.

An author who can combine all three of those things is someone I'll follow into fandoms I have no interest in. I just know I'll read almost anything this person writes.
