I don't think I put much importance on either.

Everything can work, to be fair. Some writers are very, very good at portraying characters (look at LullabyKnell and how everything is so slow. I actually forget the big plot line sometimes because I'm just so into the small things the character is doing, even if it's just a very small detail of a bigger, bigger, plot). Some other writers would take the same amount to depict things in such details and I'll be bored out of my mind. Others are just so talented at creating very unique plots and making it all about the mystery etc. And some find the perfect point between it all.

So, basically, I'm into writers who play to their strengths.
