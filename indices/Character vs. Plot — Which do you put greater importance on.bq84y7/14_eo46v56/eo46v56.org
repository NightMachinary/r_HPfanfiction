Honestly character is much more important. Almost all books follow a similar plot structure.

Something like The call to adventure Refusal to call Meeting the mentor Crossing the first threshold Belly of the whale The road of trials The meeting with the goddess The woman as temptress Atonement of the father Apotheosis The ultimate boon Return The magic flight Rescue from without Return threshold Master of two worlds Freedom to live

These are widely considered ‘the hero's journey” and it's only the characters that actually make it interesting.
