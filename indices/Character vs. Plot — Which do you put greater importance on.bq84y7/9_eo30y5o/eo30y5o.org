Plot, but only by a slight bit. If the story even has a bare-bones plot, it's good enough for me. However, if there is just no plot at all, I won't enjoy it regardless of how amazing the characters may be. The exception to this is when the existence of the character /is/ the plot. Eg. different-gender character, different-age character, different-time setting... In those stories, nothing interesting has to happen to keep me hooked, since the setting is interesting enough by itself.
