I guess a bit of both. I would say I have a little preference for the plot (I love reading about new situations or discover new way to deal with canon problems), but seeing a OOC character acting exactly like in Canon is one on the most infuriating things I have ever seen (like a Blood Purist Harry raised by Voldemort or worst, Bellatrix that somehow still befriend Hermione because "she is intelligente" and still kill the troll in the loo to saver her because reasons).
