Characters 100%. I will read totally mundane slice of life, provided the characters and their relationship feel "real". That's one reason I'm so skeptical of so many recommendations in this subreddit - a lot of them are plot-driven rather than character-driven. But I can't bring myself to care about a plot - no matter how "interesting" - if I'm not emotionally invested in how it will affect the characters, their feelings, their relationships, their development, etc. It's also why I usually prefer stories with romance at the core - they're statistically more likely to be about character rather than plot.
