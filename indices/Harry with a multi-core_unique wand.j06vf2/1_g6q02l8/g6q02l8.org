Sorry I don't know of such a fic but the question made me lol, imagining wands being like computers, so there's an Intel vs AMD thing going on with 8 core and 16 core wands. There are even NVidia wands whose centers are like fiber optic bundles with 1000s of cores, but they all have to cast the same spell at the same time. The Intel and AMD wands let you cast 8 or 16 different spells simultaneously. Heh.
