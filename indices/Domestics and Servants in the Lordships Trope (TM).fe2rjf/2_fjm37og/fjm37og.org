I envision the human servants as the ones you see while the elves are the ones who do the grunt work. For example, elves do the cleaning while hidden. Human servants only clean if a mess occurs while the employers are in the room. A human chef would direct house elves as they cook. Food would be brought via servants. The finer points of gardening and landscaping would be done by humans but grunt work would be done by elves (fertilizing, basic mowing, etc). I also think someone like the Malfoys would employ guards to protect them and their estate.
