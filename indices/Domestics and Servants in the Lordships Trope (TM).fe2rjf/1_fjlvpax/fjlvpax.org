In medieval times the closest personal servants of nobility were often of noble birth themselves. Pages and squires were the young sons of noble families who performed menial tasks such as helping their lord don his armor, caring for his horse, etc. 'Ladies-in-waiting' were typically lower-ranking noble women who would help their mistress dress, bathe, and perform other daily tasks.

All this to say, if the fic author depicts wizarding Britain as following outmoded customs of nobility, then it's not too much of a stretch to follow the same system of dutiful servitude. Just as in medieval society, having well-born (in this case magical) servants fulfills a dual purpose as status symbol and as reinforcing connections of fealty between families.
