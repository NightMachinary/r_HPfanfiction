This. Imagine the sort of "Wow, I'm /insert celebrity here/'s housekeeper!" mentality, but with old aristocrats/nobility/royalty, and you'll have the idea. "I'm the King's squire!" was the same kind of vibe back then. Plus, those positions were often quite well rewarded, and quite strangely so sometimes too. The thing you have to remember about European Royalty, Nobility, and Aristocracy, is that they're all utterly mad and whimsical people who'd give you a duchy or chop off your head and say things like "One cannot have the poor standing next to each other, it leads to things like touching, and casual fornication."

I mean, in England, being the Groom of the Stool (servant in charge of helping the King in the bathroom - and yes, it means /that/ kind of stool) was a highly sought after position. Henry VIII made his Groom of the Stool sheriff of a couple of counties, IIRC.
