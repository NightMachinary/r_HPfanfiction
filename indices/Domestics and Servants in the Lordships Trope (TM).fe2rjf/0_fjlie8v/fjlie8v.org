One of the traditional marks of wealth/privilege/power in aristocratic societies has been to have other people do things for you, and often very insignificant/specialized ones.

Think of the prestige associated with some of the hyper-specialized roles in royal courts - and the overly large number of servants associated with each task.

If we extend that to the Lordship trope, part of what makes those families distinct is that they have a lot of wealth and power. One way to show off that wealth is to have human - particularly magician - servants, because being able to afford to pay their wages would be a sign of the wealth commanded by the peer in question.

It would depend on quite how aristocratic and stratified the society is - but the more power and wealth is concentrated in a small handful of elite families in the WW, with a bunch of commoners around them, the more I would expect the more powerful/wealthy families to have human servants, even if house elves do much or most of the work.
