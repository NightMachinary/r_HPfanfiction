Cursed Child was so shite that even the most terrible of fanfiction writers won't touch it with a ten foot pole. That's how bad it is.

Which is a shame: a reimagined Delphini Riddle character going back into the past to try to foil Harry from stopping her father, only to realize that her dad was a complete cunt? And eventually falls for Harry?

"Huh... so you're telling me you're Voldemort's daughter."

Deli nodded at him, swallowing her apprehension as best as she could. She was surprised when he boyfriend started to giggle.

"So, I not only killed the evil bastard, I'm dating, fucking, and am in love with his daughter. Oh, sweet Merlin, if that's not the greatest revenge, I don't know what is!"

She froze. "Love?"

He froze. "...I used the L word too early, haven't I?"

And that, dear readers, would be relationship angst destined for another time, another place...

Oh man, the insults...

"And now, Harry Potter, you will die."

"Yeah well, I'm fucking your daughter, so there."
