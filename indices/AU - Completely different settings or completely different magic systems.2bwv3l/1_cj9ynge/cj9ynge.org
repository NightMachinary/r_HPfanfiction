Well, if you haven't read it already, I'd point to you the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Alexandra Quick series by Inverarity]]. While I stopped reading the series because of personal tastes, I think it is really well written and has a completely fleshed out American magical society. I know a lot of people really love it and it gets recced here all the time.
