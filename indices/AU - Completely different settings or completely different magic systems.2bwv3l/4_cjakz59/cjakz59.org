Incomplete but fantastic in very interesting ways:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8616362/1/Harry-Potter-The-Last-Avatar][Harry Potter: The Last Avatar]] by The Sorting Cat.

A crossover (you don't need to know much but the series is fantastic and what are you doing with your life if you haven't watched it?) with Avatar: The Last Airbender. Each house is a different element of bender. Read it. So good.

I'll also throw out one of Taure's (who I've been linking all over this subreddit) where the magic system will make you squee and wish it was complete. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5755130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lords-of-Magic-I][Harry Potter and the Lords of Magic]].
