The one I like best is the firebird trilogy. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][book 1 here]]

It's a very different AU that has a much more mature view on magic. Don't let the seemingly juvenile premise of "more women than men, therefore everyone has a harem" fool you. This story is very dark and not at all a male fantasy world.
