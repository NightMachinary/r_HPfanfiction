Not my favorite pairing, but it's often a side ship in what I read. I've always liked the idea that Viktor saw her reading in the library all the time and got curious, quickly developing a crush. And while I also usually imagine her enjoying the little physical action they get, I've always found the line that he sits and watches her study amusing. Relationship goals, I guess?

And that's pretty much how I've written them too.
