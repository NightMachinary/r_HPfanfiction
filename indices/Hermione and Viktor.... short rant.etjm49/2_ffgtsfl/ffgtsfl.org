  Does it bug anyone else how some authors change characters so much for the sake of the genre they want the story to embody?

I notice that more with Slytherin-centric fic than romances, but yes, it can be annoying.

Being in a relationship changes people. Both their priorities and, more slowly, their overall character. I can totally see Hermione borrow Harry's cloak to sneak out to her boyfriend, where (some) clothing may become optional anyway. And Hermione is pretty quick to disregard rules which get into her way. But if she's just dressing "up" in the hope of a random encounter, well, that's beyond stupid.
