Yeah in the fanfics they make it seem like he spotted her during the match and he thought about her through the game till he decided to get the game finished. Or that they also met after the match cause the Weasley's somehow got into the Minister's box and they have a short conversation. Or the mega twist for them to meet is during the whole attack at the end of the World Cup and either Hermione saves Viktor somehow or Viktor saves her somehow.
