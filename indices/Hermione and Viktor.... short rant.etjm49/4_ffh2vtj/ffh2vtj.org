Eh, I feel like Victor would have been better for Hermione. If she had flat out rejected Ron fourth year he could have become a better person in the long run. Maybe a fic where a jealous, hurt and rejected Ron becomes less jealous over the course of fifth and sixth year, improving himself on his own merits. Maybe he dates Lavender properly and gets over Hermione for good. Instead, both of them danced around each other until Ron dated Lavender (out of spite) and Hermione went 'When Birds Attack' (out of jealousy) on him.
