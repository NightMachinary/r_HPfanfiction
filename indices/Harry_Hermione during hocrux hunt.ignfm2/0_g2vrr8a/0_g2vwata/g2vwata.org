I have two fics in mind when I wrote my question. I read them like at least half a dozen years ago. I can't find them now, probably already deleted. One was called dancing in the dark on ffn, I forget the author, 4 chaps, Hermione had a dead sister whom they named their child after. The other one was on ao3, 1 chap unfinished, forget the title and author, there was a scene where they had sex by the river and end with ron coming back. I've been looking for both of these on and off for years with no avail.

I realize they may not be as rare, but it's hard to look for them among at least a million combined fics on ffn and ao3, not to mention other sites I don't know about. Ffn have more h/hr fics but the search option is not specific enough.

What i have in mind is as simple as my question, preferably well written and unplanned not a ritual pregnancy. I'll appreciate whatever comes to your mind really.
