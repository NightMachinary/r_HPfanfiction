Sorry, those don't ring a bell

Ride The Lightning and Forest of Dean are probably your best bet for this. Both are decent writing, complete, and pretty standard "H/HR get randy after Ron leaves". (There is also a one shot also called Forest of Dean with same thing)

Horocrux Scene falls into what I call "Smut Excuse" (Voldemort uses locket Horocrux to drive Harry/Hermione into lust sex, so she will get pregnant, so she will eventually leave Harry's side, so he can kidnap her to lure Harry out. One of those). Still, done better than a lot of similar setups.

(I think I ran into a few "death eater Ron" fics where the Potions run out when he leaves and h/he find out and she ends up pregnant. None of them good.

I think Vanilla was one of the sickly sweet ones that did this?

I tried searching but could not find the one where Ron bleeds out after helping Hermione give birth during the final battle, sorry.
