I like the idea of this being a run of titles said to someone who is too slow to realise it's Dumbledore being refered to.

"Had to go see... ...thing... ...whats his name. Grindelwald's wand polisher."

"Who?"

"You know, Beardy von OldGoat"

"Albert Dumdoor... Dumasadoor? Fumblemore? DirtyBore?"

"Who?"

"That guy who's hair gets in the way when he wipes his ass."

"Oh, you mean Albus Dumbledore"

"That's the bugger."
