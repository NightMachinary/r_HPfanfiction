I remember reading a fic somewhere where Voldemort figures this out, and instead of the long, costly battle for Hogwarts he brings down the wards then uses an item of his own design: A boulder the size of van that is essentially a giant-ass stunning spell. Harry wakes up in an unknown location, with 'keep him in' magic backed up by the elder wand. LV's plan is something about keeping HP too happy to break out, throws witches at him, basically every female friend he has.

Later, LV uses the Elder Wand to Fidelius 'Harry Potter is the boy-who-lived.' I think he pretty much wins at that point, cause Prophecy says only they can kill each other, and Harry is too busy being a teenage male for the first time in his life.
