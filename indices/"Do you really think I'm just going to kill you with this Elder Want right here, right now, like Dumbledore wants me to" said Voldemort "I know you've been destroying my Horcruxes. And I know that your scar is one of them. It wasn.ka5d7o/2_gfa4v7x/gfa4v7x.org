There's a really interesting WIP fic where LV figures out HP is a horcrux and does indeed use the Draught of the Living Death on him. HP wakes up centuries later in a world ruled by LV. It's eventually supposed to be HP/LV pairing but so far it's really subtle. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18851794/chapters/44742046]]
