Honestly, your enjoyment of that fic depends pretty much entirely on your tolerance for squick. Aside from the shit you've already seen, the main character does some /seriously/ evil things, including sacrificing random muggles for rituals. I'd compare it to A Clockwork Orange. If you liked that book/film, you can probably handle Princess of the Blacks. If not, I'd skip it.
