It also makes me feel really disconnected with the protagonist. Like, how can I possibly relate to her, if you don't even bother to discuss the topic seriously? Terrible characterization all the way through (at least as far as I could make it... which is not very far).

I have nothing against indulging in such a heavy topic, but that fic just does it wrong in every kind of way. I just can't read a story where I have to pretend the first three chapters didn't happen.
