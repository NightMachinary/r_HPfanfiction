I don't even consider it the worst part of the story. Sure, it's gross and everything, but it annoyed me more that the author didn't utilize it in the plot in /any/ meaningful way.

Imagine yourself planning out this story: "Okay, so, the Dursleys abandon Jennifer. She ends up in A) an orphanage, B) a foster home, C) a child brothel. Whatever, lets go with C." It reads that this is how much thought the author invested into it.

If anything, the /casual/ way he treats pedophilia is more disgusting than the pedophilia itself. You can't include such a controversial, inflammatory plot device and then for one million words treat it as an afterthought. It's just insulting to the reader.
