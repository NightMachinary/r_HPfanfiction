I'd put bestiality and pedophilia on roughly the same tier myself, but ok. EDIT: as in they are both deplorable.

And who said that it became ok? You can ignore something bad about someone you love - people do it all the time. And in the context of this story, where the victim is saying everything is fine? People can ignore a hell of a lot.
