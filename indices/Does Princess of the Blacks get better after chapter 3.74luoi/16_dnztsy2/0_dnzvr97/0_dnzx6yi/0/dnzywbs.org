You can not seriously be comparing bestiality to pedophilia. No dogs walked away traumatized from Sirius's actions, not likely at least. It's completely different things. Unlike muggles, dogs actually are animals. Pedophilia involves little fucking children who are going to grow up likely traumatized, who are so much more complex than dogs. While it's fucked up and really strange, it's not anywhere near as bad as pedophilia. I really don't get how anyone can think that it's roughly the same. You're comparing an animal that'll live a decade or so, that won't be traumatized and super fucked up from another dog fucking it, to freaking children.

They certainly act like it's no big deal.

The whole thing is just absolutely ridiculous. It's way too much to suspend my disbelief. Just because someone can ignore the fact their sister is a disgusting person doesn't mean I have to like it. It just makes Andromeda a shitty person.
