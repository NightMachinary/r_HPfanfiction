That's a common problem with "Dark" HP-fanfiction. There's no-one to root for. For some reason some authors believe that I will give any fucks about the fate of their fucked-up characters.

Everyone trying to write a fic with a villain as the protagonist should be forced to watch Breaking Bad or something similar. How laughable would that show be if you were still supposed to sympathize with the main character after a certain point?
