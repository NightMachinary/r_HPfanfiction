Andromeda had known about Narcissa's pedophilia for more than a decade by the start of the story, and iirc all of the Blacks had some rather odd fetishes. (Sirius fucking dogs in Hogsmeade, Andromeda "knowing far more about her parents sex lives than any teenager wants to", and Nymphadora changing gender mid-coitus)

As for Sirius? I'd call it a combination of "nope not dealing with that" and repression. Start of the first story, he's just happy to get his goddaughter back.

Also, traditionally dark family. I'm pretty sure that Narcissa doesn't actually consider Muggles to be human, so it isn't child abuse. ಠ_ಠ Elements of that culture might still effect the rest of the family's decisions.

So, there are a variety of reasons things move past the horror so quickly. Author Fiat is one of them. But that doesn't mean that it has to completely kill your suspension of disbelief.

Edit: Also worth noting that one of the main themes of the series is "no one gives much of a fuck about Muggles". Not Dumbledore, not the Order, and barely the Muggleborn themselves.
