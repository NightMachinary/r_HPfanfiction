In the case of /Princess/, what you see, is what you get. A mediocre plot, an abudance of author fiat in keeping the protagonist powerful, terrible characterization (they might as well be made out of cardboard, for how one-dimensional the characters are), decent pacing and technical aspects. There is some saving grace in the wider wizarding lore the author has cultivated (truthfully, the only thing that kept me reading).
