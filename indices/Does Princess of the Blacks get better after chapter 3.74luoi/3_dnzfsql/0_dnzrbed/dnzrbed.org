Agreed. Jennifer is not only an unlikable character, she is also poorly written. There are so many times when things are poorly explained that it makes things confusing (I loathe when plot/whatever are being blatantly glossed over in order to keep the reader in the dark, it just screams "don't look behind the curtain"). The pedophilia thing just felt like a cheap shock, and really needed to be handled better considering its seriousness.
