Yes and no. The world-building is good, and the conflict and action set pieces are also pretty great. It's got one of the better Voldemorts in fanon (sane and very dangerous).

The characters though are swing and miss. Jen's friends (except for Luna, Tracey, and Susan) are all the same character (they have no characterization beyond they're her friends). The Black Family is filled with pedos, bestiality and other creepy shit, and it plays little part in the story, so its just there for shock value. Dumbledore is a dumb stupid FOR THE GREATER GOOD caricature. Death is pretty cool. The other side characters (Amelia, Marchbanks) are just there to make Jen's school enemies (Dumbles and Danny Potter) look dumb. And Jen...

I'm split on Jen. She's cool. Has cool powers. But is too powerful? The only characters that can fight her equally are Voldy and a White Wizard in the 3rd book. Also the gods or Powers. But even so, I do sorta like her. She's not a perfect Mary Sue. She's got issues, moral qualms, shit she works through. I don't like the fact she's a stepford smiler.

There's also inconsistencies. Her Raven plays a big part in the early story, but then disappears in later books. Other plot threads are introduced and ignored entirely.

In all, as a piece of fan fiction, it's better than 90% of the stuff out there. The grammar is solid, and the plotting at least follows some semblance of logic. As a piece of fiction, it's average. Not wholly bad, but not great.
