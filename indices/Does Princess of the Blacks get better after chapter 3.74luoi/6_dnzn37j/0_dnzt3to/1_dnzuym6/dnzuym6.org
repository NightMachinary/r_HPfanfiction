The thing about the "Black Queen" series is that there are very few truly good characters (I never got past the second story so there might be some better ones later on). It is a fucked up world, much like the real one. My issue, however, was not the strange depiction of underage sex but the whole ritualistic murder and blood magic/voodoo stuff.
