I 100% understand where everyone comes from when they say they don't like this story. It's squicky right off the bat and unapologetic about it, like a stranger ripping off a band-aid fast. Yea, taking it off quickly will probably hurt less in the long run but your immediate reaction, "dude, wtf who are you?"

I love this story but one of the criticisms I have with it is that it does little to create a relationship between author and reader before it dives head first into the uncomfortable stuff. Since I have no suggestions on how to rewrite it to be better, I'll just leave it at that rather than overly criticize.

The thing is, it isn't supposed to be a 'nice' story and Jen isn't supposed to be a 'good' character. This is a story about an girl who does evil unapologetically for the sake of herself (and eventually her family and close friends.) She is only nominally the Hero. The only reason I've come to love her as a character is because I've spent nearly the entire four books reading from her perspective. If I were reading from Danny's I'd probably like him more than Jen.

And speaking of perspective, that's a huge thing in this series. The good guys aren't suddenly all bad people or abusive and hateful. They just look that way from a certain perspective i.e. Jen/Serious. From Jen's perspective, the "Light" is a bunch of incompetent limp noodles because they're civilians trying to act like aurors without the backbone to do what, in her eyes, is necessary. To Serious, the Potters never truly loved or cared for Jen because they did, they would have kept her even if she was a squib. To the Potters, they loved Jen dearly but didn't want her growing up in a world where being a squib would cause nothing but hardship for her, thus they thought living with the Dursleys would be a good idea. Jen is a malicious, murdering lier who needs to be stopped at any and all opportunities possible to Hermione. Tracy Davis considers Jen a good friend with a questionable moral compass but with good intentions.

I'm getting somewhat off topic.

Look, I don't know how SW could have done it better but all the squick at the beginning does serve a purpose. Like jumping right into cold water, it lets you know immediately that its not going to be a 'nice' story. It's going to delve into voodoo, black magic, torture and murder. It's going to be a story about Evil vs a lesser evil. I agree that the Blacks shouldn't have been so flippant with all the sexual deviancies but since I don't know a way he could have better handled it, I won't overly criticize SW. That scene did however establish Serious, for all that he is, is still a Black and family comes first. His big motivator is revitalize the Black family and try to take it in a different direction from its past. Also, Narcissa isn't immediately forgiven for her pedophillia, in fact its mentioned a number of times that the other members simply choose to keep it "out of sight, out of mind."

I'm rambling again. What I'm trying to say is, this story is polarizing from the get go, yes. It is, however, one of the best stories I've seen in handling alternate character interpretations through varying perspectives. It's got the best exploration of magic I've seen, you can tell the author has put tens of hours into researching things like voodoo, ancient gods and myths, divination/astrology. The world building is fantastic, consistent, and just plain interesting. Everything has an explanation, why Jen was considered a squib, why Elsie ever picked her up in the first place, yada yada.

I'm going to end this here before I ramble again but I just want to say one last time that if you're going to read the story, you need to read it from Jen Black's perspective, not yours.
