  I obviously haven't read the entire thing, but I didn't find a single redeeming characteristic about her.

That's somewhat hard to do when you haven't gotten passed chapter 3. Look, start at chapter 6, that's about an hours read and starts the Hogwarts arc. You might miss some information but it can be mostly filled in through context. From there, I think you might start to like it enough to come back and read the read the first few chapters without immediately squicking.

edit: "That's the problem. I don't want to read it from a perspective of someone who finds child rape okay." She doesn't. In fact she has a special place for rapists in her voodoo rituals. Her world view has just been so fucked that she grew up believing that the brothel was safer for the kids than child protective services, no small thanks to the Dursleys.
