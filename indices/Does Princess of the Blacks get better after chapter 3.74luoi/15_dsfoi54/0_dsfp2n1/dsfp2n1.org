  Look, I don't know how SW could have done it better but all the squick at the beginning does serve a purpose.

Yeah, to tell me to close the page.

  you need to read it from Jen Black's perspective, not yours.

That's the problem. I don't want to read it from a perspective of someone who finds child rape okay. All those other things don't matter if I can't relate to any of the characters. And the blatant acceptance of these horrible things throws out any chance of me giving a shit for any of these characters. Just because they're supposed to be evil doesn't mean I should suddenly care.

  Also, Narcissa isn't immediately forgiven for her pedophillia, in fact its mentioned a number of times that the other members simply choose to keep it "out of sight, out of mind."

And that's absurd to me. Weird, unnerving, creepy, absurd, and unrelatable.

There is literally nothing to make me give a shit about these characters. If Jen was someone like Jack Sparrow, who was selfish and shitty but enjoyable to watch, then okay. But she's not. I obviously haven't read the entire thing, but I didn't find a single redeeming characteristic about her.
