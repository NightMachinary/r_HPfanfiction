I enjoyed Princess of the Blacks when I first started reading it. I could easily ignore the pedophilia of Narcissa and some of those other things. (They just don't faze me). The story is a bit depressing, and Jennifer is /evil/. Though I still rooted for her and sometimes despised her. To me she was semi-well-written, though I eventually quit the story for reasons I can't remember.
