linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux)

It's dark Harry who uses dark magic. From what I remember it's also implied that Lily used dark magic in order to protect Harry.

linkffn(Blood Crest)

When Harry was a small child he got rescued (or more like kidnapped) by some insane dark wizard who then teaches him a lot of "shady" magic.

linkffn(Too Young to Die)

It's dark Harry and has a lot of ritual stuff.
