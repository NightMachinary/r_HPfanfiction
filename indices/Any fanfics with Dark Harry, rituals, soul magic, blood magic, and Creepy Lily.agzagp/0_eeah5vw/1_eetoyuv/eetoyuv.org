Just finished reading deathly hallowed, and can I just say this is one of the more confusing ones out there? I'm all for "reality is breaking, Cthulhu is awakening", but I had a hard time with this one. I mean, where it stops is really cute, spooky but still cute, but I honestly have no idea what's going on and wish the author had continued because it seemed really interesting.
