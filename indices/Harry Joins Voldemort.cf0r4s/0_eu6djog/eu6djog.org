I've read a few romance fics between them that fit the bill...

!linkao3(The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding)

Probably the /best/ fem!Harry/Voldemort fic out there.

!linkffn(Devil Take the Hindmost)

Voldemort is in constant contact with Harry due to the horcrux between them. This obviously affects her development and her views on the world

!linkffn(Power is Control)

Harry "joining" Voldemort in this one is dubious. There is a romance between them, but while Emily is more than willing to simply seize power, Harry is trying to satisfy her lust for power through less violent paths.
