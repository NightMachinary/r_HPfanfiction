linkffn(2970716) "Into the Fold" is a Snape-centric fic that has Eileen and Tobias' troubled relationship as a subplot.

Tobias is pushy and a standard abusive husband there, where whenever he messes up, he is persistent about being given another chance, showing he can change, and then repeating the cycle of abuse once forgiven. Eileen is weak willed and downtrodden, and mistakes his attention as affection and lets him back in every time.
