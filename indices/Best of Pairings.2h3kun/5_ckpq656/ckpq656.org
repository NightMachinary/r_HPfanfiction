I have not (re)read a worthwhile Harry/Tonks or Harry/Hermione fanfic in a very long time so I wouldn't feel right recommending one.

Never read a Harry/Gabrielle (outside of a harem), Harry/Luna, or Harry/Pansy that I liked enough to add to my favourites.

There's very few Harry/Bellatrix fanfics that I enjoyed outside of the two you mentioned and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8378840/1/Passageways][Passageways]]. This is mainly because I do not enjoy reading pairings with a large age gap and some of the first fanfics that I read had Bellatrix as an adoptive parent/parental figure.
