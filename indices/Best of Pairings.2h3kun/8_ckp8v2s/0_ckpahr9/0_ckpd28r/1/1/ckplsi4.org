I haven't read it, so I can't judge whether it's good or not. But i wanted to take this opportunity to point out that fanfiction or even most fiction doesn't necessarily have to be objectively good to enjoy it. If you enjoy it, good for you. I mean, take a look at twilight or the movie Cabin Fever. Both are objectively not good, but that doesn't mean you can't like it. I may hate twilight but i love Cabin Fever, despite (because of?) how awful it is.

So...just my two cents.
