*Harry/Draco:* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6435092/1/Turn][Turn]] or the duology [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4842696/1/Reparations][Reparations]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5047623/1/Foundations][Foundations]] by the same author.

*Draco/Neville:* The [[http://ajhall.shoesforindustry.net/about/lopiverse/][Lust Over Pendle]] series.

*Draco/Hermione:* I'm a big Dramione fan, so it's hard to pick just one, but maybe [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3144908/1/We-Learned-the-Sea][We Learned the Sea]]

*Hermione/Luna:* [[http://www.dreiser.org/miscfic/crazy.htm][Crazy Little Things]]

*Hermione/Ginny:* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7525570/1/Here-And-There][Here and There]]

*Harry/Ginny:* I don't read a lot of canon pairings. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3728284/1/In-the-Words-of-Ginevra-Molly-Potter][In the Words of Ginevra Molly Potter]] is the only one that comes to mind.

I feel like I've read a lot of Harry/Hermione but can't think of a single one that sticks out as especially great. There's a lot of clich√©d dreck in that ship. I'm curious to see if there are any good recommendations for Harry/Hermione or Harry/Ginny.
