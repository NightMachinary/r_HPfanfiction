I did read a fic sort of like this. It was a severitus story. I'm pretty sure there was snape time traveled and got harry when he was really young, moved to the Americas I think somewhere in the Caribbeanâ€˜s . The school that Harry went to the students got starter wands when they were like 5 which means they are more magically advanced compared to Hogwarts students. They end up taking their owls and their NEWTS in super early and then have the options of going for a mastery. They also had better integration with the muggle world. For whatever reason the headmaster of the school had to speak about his school to the ICW, who didn't believe that younger kids were that advanced and the school system was better. I feel like this was on A03.
