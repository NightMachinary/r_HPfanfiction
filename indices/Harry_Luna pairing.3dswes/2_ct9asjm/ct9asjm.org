- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1500318/1/Luna-s-Year][Luna's Year]] by michelle-31a is the oldest of the lot. The world-building is nothing spectacular, but it's a neat little story with some interesting ideas and characterization.\\
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5241798/1/Pathetic][Pathetic]] by A-Kubrick-Spent has a whole host of content and style issues, but there is a lot of good to say about its imagination. It's also the only take on a darker Luna I've ever found remotely engaging, but your mileage may vary.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5971274/1/Conlaodh-s-Song][Conlaodh's Song]] by enembee should not be read before reading its prequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light][By the Divining Light]]. If you haven't read them before, you should do so---not because of the pairing, but because enembee is one of the finest authors in the fandom.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=116462][Harry Potter and the Hogwarts Rift]] by Illyich follows a somewhat cookie-cutter template, and the characterization of Harry is a little wonky in places, but it contains some very compelling moments and ideas. One of the best pacifist!Luna characterizations.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3862145/1/Contemplating-Clouds][Contemplating Clouds]] by Tehan.au is simple but very intelligent fluff, and well worth reading despite being abandoned after 8,000 words.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11201910/1/Different-Together][Different Together]] by Hippothestrowl is an intelligently humorous GoF story that relies on a Rowling-like grasp of character voice and comedic beats. Unfortunately, it kind of goes off the rails in the last chapter, and some have found Harry's characterization to be off-putting.
