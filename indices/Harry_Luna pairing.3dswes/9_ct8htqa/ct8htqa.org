Linkffn(firebird's son)

It's not a romance, heavy AU, extremely dark, and not much Harry/Luna in the first book at all. Then on top of that it has other girls (but it's not your typical harem story, far from it), the character development and world don't allow much of the happy luna we all love to remain, etc.

If you are only looking for a fluffy canon-near lovetstory, stay away. But if you want something unique, then please invest few days to read this (thank god already completed) trilogy.
