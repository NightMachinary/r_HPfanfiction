The usage is simple: 1. linkffn(<Name> by <Author>) 2. linkffn(<Direct Link>) 3. linkffn(<ID>)

If you don't want to have these "linkffn" in your reply just copy and paste the links into your post and add a ffnbot!directlinks somewhere in your post.

ffnbot!ignore <-- Causes the bot to ignore your comment.
