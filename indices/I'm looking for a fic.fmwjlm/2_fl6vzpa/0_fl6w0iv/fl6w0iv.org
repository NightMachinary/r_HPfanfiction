[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19296382][*/It's All Just Temporary with a Bit of Necromancy/*]] by [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/TLC_1894/pseuds/TLC_1894][/TLC_1894/]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry gets his magical inheritance as a Necromancer on his 16th birthday, the first in centuries. Unsure of his future or even who to trust after the Light shuns him, Harry turns to the Dark, the only other side that can assist him in seeking his revenge. However, it's all just temporary. It's just an alliance until his goals are met and then that's it. Just temporary...right?Slight Dumbledore and some Order member bashing. Sane Voldemort but Horcruxes do exist. Pairings are still undetermined, but leaning to a Harry/Voldemort but not definite and won't be for a bit anyway. Not really graphic in deaths at least not yet. If that changes the rating will change.
