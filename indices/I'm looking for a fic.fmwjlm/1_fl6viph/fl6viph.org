If you haven't read it, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11949173/1/Improbable-Foundations][this]] seems to fit. It's a post-DH fic in which the trio goes back to Hogwarts to repeat their 7th year. The three of them are very close and protective of each other as a result of their experiences in the war. It's a WIP but updated pretty regularly.
