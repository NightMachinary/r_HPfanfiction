Huh odd. I had the same problem a few months ago. After the app updated the problem went away. But usually closing and opening the map works. Or just clicking sync. Can tell you though that it is a bug. (My app wont dowbload updates as long as i am reading a fic. As soon as i exit the fic, or enters the authors profile, then it will update everything
