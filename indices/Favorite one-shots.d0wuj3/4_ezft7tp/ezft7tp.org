I have several favorite one-shots. They're very different from each other.

*Mysterious*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13260163/1/Styx][Styx]] by The Divine Comedian

*Remus-centric*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12646729/1/Let-it-choke][Let it choke]] by The Divine Comedian

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12629736/1/Calibration][Calibration]] by The Divine Comedian

"*Ow, My Heart"*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12898088/1/Tired][Tired]] by FloreatCastellum

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12351608/1/Two-Things][Two Things]] by The Divine Comedian

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12768058/1/Pot-Kettle-Black][Pot, Kettle, Black]] by The Divine Comedian (technically a two-shot; Remus/Sirius, mildly explicit)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7101118][Thirty-Five Owls]] by Letterblade (The correspondence between Dumbledore and Grindelwald after he'd been defeated and imprisoned in Nurmengard. Dumbledore is perfectly in-character, and the author did a great job creating a manic, taunting, beautiful voice for Grindelwald. Rated M.)

*Funny*
