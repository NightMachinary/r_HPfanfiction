I'm a big fan of The Prince of Slytherin, but I know a lot of people aren't big fans of it. Also, though it eventually will cover the whole story, it's far from complete (only on book 4 now).

If you want to try it, you might want to skip the prologue at first and come back to it later, because it's written in a misleading way and turned me off the fic for a while. Additionally, though I was immediately intrigued by certain things in chapter 1, I feel like the fic doesn't truly pick up steam until second year.
