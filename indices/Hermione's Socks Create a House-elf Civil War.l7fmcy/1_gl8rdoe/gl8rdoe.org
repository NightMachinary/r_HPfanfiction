As Kreacher shows us, a few kind words and a nice gesture is enough to make House Elves like you. The Hufflepuffs, due to their proximity to the kitchens and the Ravenclaws, due to their ability to understand the direction in which the whole situation is going, adapt to the whole thing. Soon it's only Slytherins, who are far too arrogant to consider being nice to House Elves, that receive shit food. Amongst those Slytherins there is an orphan boy who loudly complains, "I didn't escape the orphanage just be fed the same garbage in this place. I knew it... it's all that mudblood's fault. I swear that I will kill every single mudblood and put those fucking house elves in their place even if that means tearing my soul into seven pieces."
