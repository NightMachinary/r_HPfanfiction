  BOOK ONE of 'Not a Good Man, but a Great One'. An infant Harry is thrown across time and delivered to 1927. When, at age nine, he meets a young Tom Riddle at Wool's Orphanage, he is immediately pulled into Tom's orbit. As both young boys navigate their entry into the Wizarding World, they soon learn that Harry's past is not as simple as it seems, and that their strange connection runs deeper than they'd imagined. [As of 1/2/2020, this book is fully complete.]
