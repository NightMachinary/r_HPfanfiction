There's a relatively common trope wherein Harry gets transported back in time and grows up with Tom at Wool's. Here are some examples that I've loved:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5925524/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate]] - One of the earliest and most well known fics that popularized this trope. The author does an excellent job portraying their earlier lives as well as Grindelwald's war heating up on the continent. The fic has been dead for years, but the author recently posted a note about continuing the story at some point later this year. linkffn(5925524)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20997323/chapters/49933835][Ripples Across the Water]] - A very well written story-in-progress that is currently midway through Harry & Tom's second year together at Hogwarts. linkao3(20997323)
