That would be a hilarious SI moment. "Harry" walks into the area for the task, pulls an eel out of his pocket and throws it in front of the dragon. Hagrid, Charlie and the rest of the dragon-handlers flinch. The dragon starts whining and trying to back away. Hits the end of the chain and debates chewing off her foot to get rid of the chain to get further away.

Malfoy tries to accuse "Harry" of using "Dark Magic" on the dragon. "Harry" throws another eel and hits Malfoy in the face, and it falls into his robes. He reacts the same way as the Dragon did. Insert joke about Draco being close enough to Dragon for it to work.

I just checked. The book series came out in 2003, ended in 2015.
