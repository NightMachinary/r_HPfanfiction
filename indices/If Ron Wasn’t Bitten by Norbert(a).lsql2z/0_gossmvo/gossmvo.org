Well since Malfoy. Wouldnt have know when they were moving him he wouldnt have been out that night and gotten caught harry and Co wouldnt have been riding the high of getting the dragon safely away and Malfoy getting detention so they likely wouldnt have forgotten the cloak neville wouldnt have been out trying tonwarn them so he wouldnt have gotten caught. So all in all it might have all gone off without a hitch
