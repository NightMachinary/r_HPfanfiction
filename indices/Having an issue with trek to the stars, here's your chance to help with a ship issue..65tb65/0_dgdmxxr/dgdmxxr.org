Not sure why he would want the ship to look like a Vengeance. As a morphing ship, its appearance is camouflage and misidentification but overall the underlying capacity and drive profiles shouldn't be variable. He'd be better off having it default to a rusty old bird-of-prey (used by Klingon and Romulan fleets in TOS) that he could pass off as a captured raiding ship. Low crew needs and unassuming... with a Cloak of invisibility. How much more Harry can you get?
