His owning and using a bird of prey is a known event already, he painted it bone white and named it H'dweg. He bought it and another ship, nominally for use in picket duty, after a pretty wild party that bound him fairly close to an old high caste klingon family and used it to travel to earth once already. Typical Harry luck after drinking too much klingon hooch. It would be the default ship.

The master shipwright would be the one who is installing the ship profiles, not Harry, he's just going to be surprised by the new ship. He was going to be expecting to wait a year or so due to design and build time or have to purchase a new one from somewhere that doesn't keep bugging it.

As for drive profiles and capacity: in the magical world, external shape doesn't need to conform to internal capacity, see a mokeskin pouch, the room of requirement, the weasleys's car's capacity, and so on. Drive profiles can also be futzed with by multiple engines held in abeyance by magic and swapped in and out on the fly.
