The universe will soon be at war. That it will be losing.

The time ship is necessary to deal with some accidental time travelers. The bird of prey conforms to known events. I liked the idea of the Vengeance because Harry's a relic himself though an infinitesimal amount of people outside his own know this. His piloting a Vengeance clone that has to be refitted constantly during a war that subsumes at LEAST the alpha and beta quadrants felt somewhat poetic and a prime number is better due to the numerology inherent in the hpverse.
