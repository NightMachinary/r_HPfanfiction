From a literary standpoint the question becomes does this ew feature resolve conflicts without tension? If so, then yes, it is overpowered. If this is simply a tool in Harry's kit then it's not overpowered.

Power level really doesn't matter in entertainment. What matters is tension and resolution. The more tension builds, the more rewarding the resolution is. In order for tension to be believable the power of the protagonist needs to not overshadow the problems being faced, or forgotten about because they are inconvenient.
