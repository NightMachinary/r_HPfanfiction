I was more going down the line of Hannah's mum being a sort of magic researcher, doing studies on habits of wizards and sometimes how they compare to muggles. She starts examining kids environments based on surveys of first years, and how their genes may factor in their ability of magic alongside their own personal regimes, only to come across some strange findings that may debunk the theories spread from the Pureblood purist movement and upon publishing it with her academic partner Charity Burbage.

It's a side plot in a bigger fanfic, but I feel it could be threatening enough to make the Death Eaters actually want to quash something.
