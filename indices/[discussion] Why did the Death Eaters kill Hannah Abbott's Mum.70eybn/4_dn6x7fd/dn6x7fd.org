The Abbots were more than simply pureblood, weren't they part of the so called Sacred Twenty-eight? So they probably thought them worse than the Weasleys, because they were at least still pure, despite being blood traitors. That's why even though Bill and Fleur had to hide, Mr, Mrs, Percy, and Ginny were fine. Even Ron was, as long as he stayed put 'ill in bed'. They targeted open dissidents, and crossbreeding. And muggleborns, of course. Half bloods were ok, muggleborns and creatures not.
