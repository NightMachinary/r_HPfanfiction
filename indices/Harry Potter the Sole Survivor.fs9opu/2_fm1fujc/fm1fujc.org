Hmm two fics come to my mind. Both crossovers. One with Firefly : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]]

And one with Star Wars : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11675231/1/Shiver-me-Timbers][Shiver me Timbers!]]

There are of course many other crossover with Star Wars and one I unfortunately don't remember the name of with Star Trek (if someone knows which one tell us).
