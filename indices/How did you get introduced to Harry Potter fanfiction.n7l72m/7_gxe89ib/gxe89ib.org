That's embarrassing? I found it through watching those yt videos that are kinda like fanfic but only ship Harmony, Hinny or Drarry and have a death eater attack/Ginny kidnapping/Harry going to murder death eaters every second episode thingy, they were horrible and basically always unfinished so I searched for better stuff, and found fanfiction, then I started reading and now I'm addicted

Oh and I forgot the ones where the marriage of Harry and Ginny was made to be some international spectacle and Harry's parents and Sirius were resurrected just as a gift for Harry, but of course they can only stay a day/a week because "the rules of the dead prohibit them from staying too long" or some bs
