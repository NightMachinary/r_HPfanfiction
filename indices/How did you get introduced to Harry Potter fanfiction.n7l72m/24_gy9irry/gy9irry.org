I'm very much embarrassed by this. I first got into fanfiction in general through a fanfic that my friend was reading. I believe it was a Human!poke on x reader. I didn't make it past the first chapter due to bad grammar. Then I came across black butler x readers which then lead to me finding a Black Butler/Harry Potter crossover. And that's the story of how I got into it.
