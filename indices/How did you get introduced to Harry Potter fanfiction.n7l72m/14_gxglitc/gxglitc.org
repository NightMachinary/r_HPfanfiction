I was looking for online books. Original works that I could read for free from an app. I found wattpad. At first I only read original stuff, then I ran across a story about a real singer and I was like , “wait! You can do that?” So I looked into it and found Fan-fiction about creepypasta (I was 12 and really into “horror” stories, ok!?) It only spiraled from there.
