Finished DH and... "now what?". I like how some fics are like "preprocessed food" if you will, no need to remember yet-another-characters name (I'm pretty bad at that) or grasping how the world works. Sure original fic has its own charm, but if you want to go 0 to page-turning-fest in just a few minutes, good fanfics are your best bet.
