I remember somehow ending up on Fanficnet reading some weird lemon fic about Ginny and Hermione Polyjuicing into Ron and Harry alternatively so that they could "get used to sleeping with them". I ended up not reading any HP fanfic for several years.Actually I even went through a "HP hate" phase, cause I'd watched a couple of edgy anime and now thought HP had "no balls" Eventually 2020 rolled around and gave everyone at least a drop of free time, and I started reading this fic,which is still one of my favorites to date, Recnac Transfaerso
