I'd always heard that fanfiction is almost always shitty, but some years ago I decided to give it a try. One chapter of /Methods of Rationality/ later, I was convinced they were right and dropped the idea.

Then, about 2 years ago, I came across /Picnic Panic/ by /LeQuin/ and I haven't stopped since. Harry Potter was the first fandom whose fanfiction I explored, but I've now been through Star Wars, Naruto, Stormlight Archive and even Pokemon.
