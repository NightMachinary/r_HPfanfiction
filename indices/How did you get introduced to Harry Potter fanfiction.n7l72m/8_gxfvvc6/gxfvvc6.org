I was worrying my own fanfic in elementary school. I didn't know it was a thing. Then in 6th grade so like 2006 I found fanlib. I honestly don't know how I stumbled upon it. I found out there were other people doing the same thing as me. It had a wonderful community. I was so sad when it closed in down in 2008. After that I started exploring fanfic.net

If there are any former fanlib people I miss you all!
