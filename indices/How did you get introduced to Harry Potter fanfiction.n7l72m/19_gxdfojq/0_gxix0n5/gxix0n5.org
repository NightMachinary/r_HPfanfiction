Hey, HPMoR was my first HP fanfic too, and was actually what got me into fanfiction in general.

I was introduced to it by the counselor of my country's team for the International Olympiad of Linguistics (which I was on). She called it “both entertaining and educational” or some such, and I decided to read a few chapters to humor her only to get hooked and spend wayy too much of the once-in-a-lifetime experience that was traveling abroad to participate in an international competition glued to my phone reading it.

Since then I have essentially not stopped being glued to a device reading fanfic.
