I was about 10 and Eoin Colfer used to publish the first chapter of his upcoming Artemis Fowl books online, I found Artemis Fowl fanfic, and my mind was blown.

I loved it because my book consumption had been limited to the (very small) school library, discovering I could read /as many books as I wanted/ online was a real game changer.
