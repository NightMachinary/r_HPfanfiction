Correct. Rule 8 states that we can't link to fics that sexualize minors, meaning anyone 17 and younger (as we are going by USA's definition of minor because reddit is USA based). Because it never really states /what/ age Harry/Hermione are once they start getting involved with each other, we have to play it on the safe side and not link the fic.

Again, discussion is fine, direct linking is not.
