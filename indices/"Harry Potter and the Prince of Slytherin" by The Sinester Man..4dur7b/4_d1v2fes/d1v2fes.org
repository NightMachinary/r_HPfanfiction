I tried reading it until chapter 30 or so and just check back once in a while. It does have some interesting ideas and at least for WBWL! Fics doesn't go straight for the evil Dumbledore trope. Still it cannot escape the fundamental problems with such fics, as it requires the Potters to be as unloving to Harry as possible and is a massive departure from canon as it is.

But as you noticed, it is incredible long for a fic that is only in 2nd year. At this point, I worry that the author might start to lose control of his plot points and ideas and the fic becomes more needlessly complex than it needs to, especially.

So if you like WBWL Harry, this is another unique take. But if you have reservations about a fic that is already longer than the first 3 books combined, yet has not even cleared the second in terms of scope, than you should just skim the fic for the key details if you have any interest
