It's my favourite story that's still updating. The writer is absolutely fantastic and whenever there's an update I can't put it down.

Agreed with the other commenter- Best Lockhart I've ever seen by far! I definitely recommend reading this fic. There's so many unique little sub-plots on the go. It is definitely not a canon rehash.
