So, I just read through this and enjoyed it quite a bit. It is a bit on the wordy side, but I've found it manageable. I personally like how the author takes some tropes and ideas and creates a spin on them. For example, the author gives some reasons for James bias against slytherins. Not all of it's entirely rational or perfectly plausible, but I like to see stories where all the characters have motivations.

It definitely does have kids who don't act like kids, but if you can look past that, then the characters are relatively decent.

Perhaps the most interesting thing to see where it's going is the whole plot-line behind the [[/spoiler][world forgetting the nargles, beginning with Pandora's use of magic]] .

Overall, its a story with an interesting premise, if not ambitious. For a variety of reasons it has made it onto my favorites list.
