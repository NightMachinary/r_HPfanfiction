I am curious if you have read the story, cause some very interesting stuff goes down in the fic. Unless you were generalising.

Anyway, you could say it is a bait and switch, but since the story remains compelling, does it really matter? It would be fun to read on and find out how the hero journeys up to that point. If the author switched to a boring narrative, then it would be another matter---but that doesn't seem to be the case here.

Of course, as you said, different people like different things.
