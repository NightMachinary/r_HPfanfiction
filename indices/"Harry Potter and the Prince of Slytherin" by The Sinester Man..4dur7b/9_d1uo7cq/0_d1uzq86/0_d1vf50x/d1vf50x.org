Because not all of us like the [[https://www.ted.com/talks/j_j_abrams_mystery_box?language=en][mystery box]] type of storytelling. I really hate when a story only teases the interesting part of a story and then proceeds to ignore it in favor of boring bullshit.

It's a blatant [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch][Bait and Switch]] and not everyone like it.
