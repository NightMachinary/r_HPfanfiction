UGH, seeing as people are generally fond of the story I was planing on reading it, but after the massive cock tease that is the first chapter I don't think I'll be able to do it.

Set up all this interesting stuff, then go, "NA WE'RE TOTALLY JUST GOING TO GO BACK IN TIME TO 1991 AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO READ THROUGH 700,000 WORDS (HALF OF WHICH AREN'T OUT YET) UNTIL YOU GET BACK TO WHERE THE STORY BEGAN."

Not to mention Sirius is going to be in Azkaban for no good reason for 400,000 words. Joy.
