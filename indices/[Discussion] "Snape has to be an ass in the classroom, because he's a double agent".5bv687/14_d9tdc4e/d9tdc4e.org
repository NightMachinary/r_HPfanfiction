hm, i can accept the interpretation that it was implicitly bigoted of him to allow draco to bully hermione, but i don't think that's how he saw it, and erases any nuance about his position. i think he opposes anti-muggleborn discrimination and is aware of, and in support of his work 'to save the world'. from canon and word of god:

  One person. All it takes is one person. I couldn't save Harry for Lily. So now I give my allegiance to the cause she believed in. And it's possible --- that along the way I started believing in it myself.
