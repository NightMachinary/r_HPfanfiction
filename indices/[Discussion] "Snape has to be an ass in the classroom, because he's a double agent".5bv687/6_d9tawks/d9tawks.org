I wouldn't say that Snape's behaviour makes him the worst spy. The nature of Snape's position is that both sides know that he's a spy, both sides know that the other side knows that he's a spy, and both sides think he's actually loyal to them. That basically gives him the freedom to act however he likes. No behaviour makes him a bad spy because there are no behaviour expectations on him.
