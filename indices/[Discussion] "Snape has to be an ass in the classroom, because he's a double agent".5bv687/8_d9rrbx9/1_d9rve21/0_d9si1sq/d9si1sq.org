As bashes go, I'd say this was only moderate. Dumbledore gets things pointed out to him and actually listens, Ron goes pretty nuts for a while but later we find out ..., well, he gets redemption, I guess. I'm not saying the story is great, it's simply okay/readable. It's also the first of three stories, about 300,000 words total.
