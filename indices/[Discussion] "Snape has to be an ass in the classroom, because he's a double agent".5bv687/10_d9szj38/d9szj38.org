To expand on other people's points:

Voldemort returned. He asked his followers: what have you done in my absence?

Most of them were self-serving and did nothing against him. They paid their way out of Azkaban or dissembled with sufficient skill. He can deal with selfish people.

Snape, though, had Dumbledore's endorsement. That was a huge mark of suspicion. If he hadn't been doing /something/ to advance Voldemort's cause in that time, he would have been killed immediately, or at least made useless as a spy. Sent him on suicide missions. Made him do something even more stark to prove his loyalty.

This assumes that he and Dumbledore couldn't cook up any better plan than to traumatize two decades of schoolchildren and scare off three fourths of potential potioneers against the eventual return of Voldemort. And what did that buy them? Snape was able to give the sword of Gryffindor to Harry -- whereas Dumbledore could have left it outside Hogwarts, or in the Chamber of Secrets, and simply told Harry where it was; and there was no particular reason to expect that Snape could find them and every possibility that Voldemort would move Snape to another position.

It was a bad plan. It happened to work.
