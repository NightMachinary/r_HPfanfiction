I think this is already answered but most kids seem to be sorted into their parents house(s) and almost every British wizard seems to attend Hogwarts so it only seems to follow that the older kids who picked on Snape at Hogwarts were the parents/relatives of kids who attend Hogwarts with Harry.

I can image Snape keeping very detailed notes of just who mistreated him during his *entire life* and keeping a mental (or even physical) tote board of the repayments he makes.

If magic didn't exist in Snape's world, I could see him becoming a kleptomaniac or pyromaniac as a form of payback but without magic, the basic conflict between his parents wouldn't have existed and he'd have a whole different upbringing.
