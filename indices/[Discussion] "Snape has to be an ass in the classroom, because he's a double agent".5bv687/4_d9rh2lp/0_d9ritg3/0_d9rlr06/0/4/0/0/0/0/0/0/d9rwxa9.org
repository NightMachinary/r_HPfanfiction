mm. to clarify- i don't think his behaviour was an act, or that he was a good person. i don't think you can definitively state how snape would have turned out without being mistreated by the marauders. before hogwarts he was bigoted, though i think his political allegiances are (obviously) flexible. i don't think he's misanthropic- he obviously put himself out there to be friends with and nice to lily, likes to stan for the slyths etc. i do think he was obsessed with lily, but i similarly don't think his feelings for her can be separated from his remorse etc.
