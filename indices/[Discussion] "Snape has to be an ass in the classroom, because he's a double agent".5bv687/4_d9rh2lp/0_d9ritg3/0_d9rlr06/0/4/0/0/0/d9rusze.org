I am not saying that he deserved the treatment he got. I am saying that he was most likely not some innocent victim in it, and that the one single memory Harry witnessed was a biased, one-sided version of events. The fact that Lily apparently broke all ties with him after he called her a name just ONCE when they'd been friends for years suggests that she was more or less fed up with his shit. Either that or he made no pretense at apologizing afterward.

Again, I don't dislike the character. I think he's one of the most complex characters that JKR rolled out, and one of the more interesting ones. I am just not romanticizing his intentions or trying to make him a "misunderstood soul." Snape was an asshole, plain and simple. I think that holding onto his obsession with Lily and hatred of James some 10 years after they'd died and then projecting those feelings onto their orphan son is weird and unhealthy.
