i'm not sure what we're debating? saying that he's a product of abusive environments contextualises, not romanticises, his behaviour. you said that his behaviour 'can't be blamed' on bullying, but jo consciously wrote his character as being a product of that. he retaliated against james and sirius' abuse, obviously. that isn't the same as framing it as them being 'equally horrible to each other'. also, pensieve memories are objective. as for lily- why wouldn't he 'hold onto' a woman whose murder he had a part in, and when both of their actions changed the world/wizarding britain? that's like saying grindelwald and dumbledore should just forget about each other because their friendship is over. their relationship and actions had consequences outside of that.
