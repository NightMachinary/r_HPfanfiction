Sorry about that. I guess if we're making a nurture vs. nature debate, my interpretation of his character was that he was always an unpleasant person (maybe from his home situation?), and his treatment in school only intensified those traits, not created them.

And the Lily thing is just weird to me. Feeling regret is fine. Exactly how he felt about Lily when Harry showed up is sort of vague. I interpreted it in a much creepier, obsessive way. Like I wish in his memory conversation with Dumbledore, he'd been a little clearer with the significance of his doe patronus and the "always" statement, because it can be interpreted as either "I will always remember the consequences of what I did." or "I will always have this stalker-ish, unrequited love for a dead woman." and some people legitimately did read it as the latter.

But also, fandom has tainted my feelings toward him, honestly. So maybe I am making unfair assumptions. I admit a lot of your points are valid, but I can't really buy into the idea that his behavior was all an act.
