I recently noped out of a fic, because Harry did not understand why Lily wouldn't forgive a friend for an insult. Snape not only called her the equivalent of the n-word at a time like today, but at a time equivalent to when blacks were actively hunted and dragged behind horses/cars.

People who use the word Mudblood want to see her dead or worse: It's not the same as forgiving a simple insult.
