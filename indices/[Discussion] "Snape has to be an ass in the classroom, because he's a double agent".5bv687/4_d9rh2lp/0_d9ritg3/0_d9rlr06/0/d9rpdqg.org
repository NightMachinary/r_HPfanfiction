Snape's memory was a completely one-sided and biased opinion of one event. From all accounts, Snape was just as horrible to James & Co. as they were to him.

So his behavior can't be blamed on bullying, he was just an asshole.

(This does not mean I dislike the character. I LOVE the Dursleys as characters, even though they were horrible people.)
