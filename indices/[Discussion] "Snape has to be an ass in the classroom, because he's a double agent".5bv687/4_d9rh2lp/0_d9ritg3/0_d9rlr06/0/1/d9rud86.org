  Snape's memory was a completely one-sided and biased opinion of one event

Actually it wasn't one-sided and wasn't biased. The Pensieve is objective fact, as JKR already confirmed.

  JKR: It's reality. It's important that I have got that across, because Slughorn gave Dumbledore this pathetic cut-and-paste memory. He didn't want to give the real thing, and he very obviously patched it up and cobbled it together. *So, what you remember is accurate in the Pensieve.*

Snape's memory was objective fact, and everything happened in the memory without bias or lies. Actually, Snape wasn't as bad to the Marauders as they were to him.

- Sirius manipulated Snape and had him almost get killed or turned into a Werewolf, without any remorse or regret, and Sirius knew exactly what would happen to Snape since he wasn't exactly ignorant of what a Werewolf would do to a human being.

- Side Note: Sirius not only almost had Snape killed, but he USED Lupin. Sirius didn't care what the consequences would be for Lupin if Snape had died or became a Werewolf (i.e. Lupin gets expelled, then sent to Azkaban, and probably kissed by a Dementor given the anti-Werewolf nature of the wizarding world). Sirius' desire to kill Snape outweighed Lupin's worth as a friend.

- James and Sirius then ganged up on Snape 2v1, publicly humilating by hanging him upside down no differently than the Death Eaters did to the muggles in GoF (as Hermione reminds us in HBP). Lupin also fails to stop the bullying despite having the authority of a prefect. I'd expect that behavior from Ron, not from Lupin. Keep in mind that SWM happened after the Werewolf event so it only makes SWM a worse act.

- Levicorpus flipped Snape upside down so he was basically pantsed in front of the entire school. Imagine if Draco had done that to Hermione? But I suppose that if the Marauders had done that to a girl, the implications would probably be too dark for HP.

- Side Note: Snape needed Diffindo/Sectumsempra to defend himself, but only when the Marauders weren't paying him attention. Given James' lack of cursed wounds and Sirius/Lupin never bring up the cut, it heavily implies that Snape used Diffindo in SWM and then created Sectumsempra at some point after SWM but before he left Hogwarts.

- The fact we never see the outcome of SWM in either OOTP or DH heavily implies that James did in fact strip Snape by removing his underwear in front of the whole school. Its further implied by the fact that McGonagall, Flitwick, Hagrid, and Dumbledore seem pretty ignorant of the conflict by how James and Sirius were remembered. Its not like JKR could have actually put that scene in the book given how it would pretty much be putting sexual assault in the book, which is a massive no-no. If Snape had been a girl, the entire Levicorpus-Underwear stuff would be a whole lot more blatant.

What I'm saying is that Snape never did anything even remotely comparable to what the Marauders did. Lily asks what he (Snape) has ever done to them (James/Marauders). Lupin seemed to regret that he didn't speak up during OOTP, so part of him knew what was happening was wrong.

*Now Avery and Mulciber DEFINITELY did things at least as bad as the Marauders during Hogwarts, and by the seventh year, they were definitely worse since they were probably Death Eaters by that point.* Snape may have been the Marauders favourite victim, but Avery and Mulciber (and Lucius, etc too) were the real threat since they represented everything the Marauders hated (dark arts, pureblood supremacy, Death Eaters in training, etc) and unlike Snape, they would be able to fight back and would be darker.

Its implied that the so-called "dark magic" that Mulciber used on Mary Macdonald was actually Levicorpus. Specifically, he used in the same way that James used it on Snape. This is further implied by the fact that Ron found Levicorpus funny when used on him in HBP, and Dean and Seamus found it funny to be used on Ron, and Snape found Mulciber's use of the spell funny. Lily calls what Mulciber did to Mary "dark magic" yet she, like basically every non-villain in HP, has a hypocritcal definition of dark magic. Yet Levicorpus is considered dark by the Trio when used on the muggles but Ron finds it fun to be used on himself. Snape found Mulciber's use of the spell amusing but not when used on him. Any non-villainous character considers anything they don't like to be dark magic, yet they have no problem using that magic themselves since its not dark magic if they or their friends do it.

So the worst Avery and Mulciber did in Hogwarts is use a spell that is pretty much heavily implied to be Levicorpus, yet neither are said to be prefects. The Marauders also became unregistered Animagi and smuggled a Werewolf out around Hogsmeade, knowingly endangering the lives of innocent Hogsmeade residents. As far as I see, what the Marauders did becoming unregistered Animagi and setting Lupin out on the town is almost as bad as Voldemort's original use of the Basilisk. The only thing keeping it from being as bad is that the Marauders didn't get anyone killed because of it.

As much as people bring up Snape's "gang of Slytherins", they only exist in Sirius' questionable biased memory, especially since Sirius implied that Snape has friends. If anything, the worst thing Snape ever did as a Hogwarts student was passively watch as Avery and Mulciber bullied others. Snape was never the Marauders' equal, he was the Lupin of the Slytherins in that both Snape and Lupin passively watched their housemates bullied others, yet neither objected since they believed that they would be rejected otherwise. Snape is almost as guilty as Lupin in that aspect. I say -almost- guilty because Lupin was a prefect so he was obligated to object to what the Marauders did, Snape wasn't obligated to object since he wasn't a prefect but he should have done it anyway.
