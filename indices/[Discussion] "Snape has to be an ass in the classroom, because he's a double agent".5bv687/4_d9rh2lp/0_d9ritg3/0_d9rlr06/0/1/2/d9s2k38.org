  If anything, the worst thing Snape ever did as a Hogwarts student was passively watch as Avery and Mulciber bullied others.

Which likely was the case and it likely did colour the other students' view of him, regardless of whether it was fair or not. Add to that his generally dour personality (that stemmed from family issues and not really having many friends, rather than from getting “dark”, but the public did not care and likely did not even know) and it would be easy for people to assume that he is a bully in the making who is simply biding his time. And it's likely that this lead to people having enough of a problem with him as a person that nobody actually put any effort into stopping James's inanity during the incident.

The “mudblood” comment? He probably got it from associating a bit too much with Avery and Mulciber, which would serve to highlight the fact that he spent enough time with them to be seen as their standard associate and someone just like them. And while there's really no excuse for him using that word towards Lily, it's probable that he used that word because he was fed up with everyone crapping on him for what he saw to be no reason back then.
