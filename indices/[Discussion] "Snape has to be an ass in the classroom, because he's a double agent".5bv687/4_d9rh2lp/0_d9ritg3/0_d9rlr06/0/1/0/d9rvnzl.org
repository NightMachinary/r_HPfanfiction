A valid point. Perhaps instead of unbiased I should have said isolated? So we can assume that everything that happened in that one memory was 100% factual. My point was based more along the lines of Snape wasn't some poor, mistreated soul who never retaliated. I always assumed that maybe the marauders started picking on him because he was an easy target, but his personality never allowed him to just let it go, and so things just snowballed.

I suppose my original argument was more along the lines of Snape was not some miserable, mistreated soul who really just needed a hug. He was a nasty person who lashed out at others. Buuuut this discussion is evolving past the OP's original question, so I'll leave it there. Basically, I think that he was not a "good" person and that his behavior as a Hogwarts teacher was not an act.
