  I suppose my original argument was more along the lines of Snape was not some miserable, mistreated soul who really just needed a hug.

i think that's the point of the counter? snape /was/ horrendously mistreated, and that did affect his behaviour. he lashed out, because of that abuse. he should have gotten support, and it's not unrealistic to suggest he would have been better if positive qualities had been cultivated in him.

on a slight tangent, i want to comment generally on a line of thought that i occasionally see around the sub. woobie!snape isn't a fan creation (or woobie!draco for that matter, but that's another discussion). it's a huge part of his arc, the narrative and how harry's conceptualises and relates to him. the first thing harry thinks on after leaving snape's memory isn't about lily, it's this:

  But he was home. Hogwarts was the first and best home he had known. He and Voldemort and Snape, the abandoned boys, had all found home here. ...

he consciously empathises with snape, and consciously associates his father with his bullies- draco, dudley. ignoring that is like reading carrie and only taking away that carrie was a nutcase and telekinesis is bad
