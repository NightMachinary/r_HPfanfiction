  Sirius manipulated Snape and had him almost get killed or turned into a Werewolf, without any remorse or regret, and Sirius knew exactly what would happen to Snape since he wasn't exactly ignorant of what a Werewolf would do to a human being.
#+end_quote

To be more accurate Sirius didn't manipulate Snape, he simply told him how to go there expecting the Slytherin to be nosy enough to follow Remus. It speaks of Sirius's chaacter who was ready to have Snape killed (or whatever his intents were) just for fun. However it is Snape who chose to go there, to broke the school rules in order to have his suspicion confirmed and then ruined Remus's life. He wasn't some kid that was so intimidated by older student into doing something he didn't want nor he was forced to go there, he alone is responsible of what happened to him that night.

  Its implied that the so-called "dark magic" that Mulciber used on Mary Macdonald was actually Levicorpus.

Where did you get that from ? From what Lupin said "Levicorpus" was quite popular back in the day so I doubt Mulciber's joke had anything to do with that jinx.

  Side Note: Snape needed Diffindo/Sectumsempra to defend himself, but only when the Marauders weren't paying him attention. Given James' lack of cursed wounds and Sirius/Lupin never bring up the cut, it heavily implies that Snape used Diffindo in SWM and then created Sectumsempra at some point after SWM but before he left Hogwarts.

Don't know what it was but from Remus's experience 'Sectumempra was always Snape's speciality' (we don't know for how long) it implied that Snape used it quite often at the time.
