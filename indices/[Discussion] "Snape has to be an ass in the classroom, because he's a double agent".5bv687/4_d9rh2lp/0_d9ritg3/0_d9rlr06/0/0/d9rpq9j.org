Which only reinforces the whole thing. We do know that he'd thought himself bullied by James and party and yet he clearly could play their game too. It's not hard to think that there might have been more people who had a problem with him and that most of them did it precisely because of his behaviour; likewise, it's not hard to think that he might have thought himself bullied by those other people too, even if not as much as by James and his group.

Whether or not he actually was bullied or if he gave as much as he took is not very relevant for Snape's feelings towards all the people around him, I think. What matters is how /he/ saw it back then, regardless of whether he was right or wrong.
