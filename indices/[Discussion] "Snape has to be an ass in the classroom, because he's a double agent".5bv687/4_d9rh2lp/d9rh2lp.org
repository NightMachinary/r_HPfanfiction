Snape was an unpleasant, unhappy person and he did a great job of playing both sides for his own agenda.

He used the same excuse to Dumbles & Voldie: I have to act like a complete ass to all non-Slytherians or people will think I'm a spy.

I think Snape got bullied by Griffs, Ravens and Huffles (and the teachers) in school and while the Snakes didn't protect him - they didn't go out of their way to harass him - unlike Potter/Lupin/Black et al.

His treatment of the other houses is just payback for the way he was treated. He's paying back the wrong people (innocent kids) but most of those kids are the children of the people who treated him poorly so it justifies it in his mind I think Snape, like many abused people, does not see the cycle of abuse he is trapped into.
