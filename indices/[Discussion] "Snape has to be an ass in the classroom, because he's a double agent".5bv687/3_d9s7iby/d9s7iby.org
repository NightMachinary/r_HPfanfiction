The reason why Snape is a complicated character is because the reader is suspicious of him and even hates him, right up until the last book where they suddenly sympathize with him. He's obviously not a good person, and I think he knows it. But he's trying to do what he has to so that he can atone for what he's done.

But about his behaviour not reflecting his being a spy: you have to actually consider Voldemort and his madness, fueled by his jealousy, paranoia, and his hunger for power. Snape had to walk a fine line between showing too much support for either the light or dark side of the war, but I think Voldemort would most definitely have killed him if he had shown any type of favouritism that he felt was too great towards Dumbledore's side. Not that it excuses his behaviour, which I also believe Snape knew and sometimes took advantage of. But Voldemort was much more of a threat, and he needed to remain firmly in Voldemort's camp to everyone except for the Order to achieve that redemption.
