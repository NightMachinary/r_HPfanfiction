Oh how I wish there had never been an epilogue and JKR had left the series alone never speaking to journalists or starting pottermore. Our imaginations could probably/ definitely would have done better things.

That being said I have often wondered if Harry's second son was named after Snape not so much because Harry ever forgave him or even liked him but because if he didn't then nobody would ever understand the sacrifices Snape made and quite how often he put his life on the line. Like a walking talking memorial, not a sign of forgiveness.
