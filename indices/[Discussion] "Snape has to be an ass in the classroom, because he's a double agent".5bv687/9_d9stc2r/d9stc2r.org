At the time I'm posting this, half of the comments discuss Snape at Hogwarts being relentlessly bullied by the Mauraders, we also know he was a non-pureblood in Slytherin, and his parents were abusive assholes. All of which made him a nasty person. When he returned to teach there were still students who knew him as a student, his reputation at that point was he was an awful, miserable, nasty student who became a death eater and then comes back as a teacher. If he suddenly, changed and either became too chummy with anyone it would set off alarm bells, I think he had to continue being the one thing everyone knew him as, miserable. If everyone could say Snape has always been that way, he has always been miserable and awful, they wouldn't examine his actions as closely. I also think he hated teaching and was poorly suited for it, and lived a life where he really couldn't move on get married and be happy, which also will make you bitter as hell. And he had some guilt issues.
