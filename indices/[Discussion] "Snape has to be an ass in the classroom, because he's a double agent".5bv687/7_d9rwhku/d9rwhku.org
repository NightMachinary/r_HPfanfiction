He's not being a very convincing sleeper agent /to you or anyone else/, but he is to Voldemort. The problem with your reasoning is that he needs to be convincing to Voldemort, who is not a particularly logical person. He's a paranoid, narcissistic psychopath. If Snape starts acting nice, Voldemort will see that as Snape switching sides, even if being a convincing "good guy" to Dumbledore would require it.
