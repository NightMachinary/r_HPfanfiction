hm, are you saying that because he behaves like a jerk people would assume he's a terrorist?

  Instead, Rowling shows us a Severus Snape that is consistently behaving like a supporter of blood purity who shows flashes of the more extreme convictions of Voldemort supporters.

what do you mean by this? he favours his slytherins, but there isn't anything to suggest that only applies to pureblood slyths. he only focuses on malfoy because of his relationship with his parents when he starts.

  From this perspective you have to speculate at the reasons why Dumbledore would keep Snape around in a school of all places, why him behaving almost like a Death Eater is worth accepting.

voldemort would think that dumbledore values him as a spy and informant.
