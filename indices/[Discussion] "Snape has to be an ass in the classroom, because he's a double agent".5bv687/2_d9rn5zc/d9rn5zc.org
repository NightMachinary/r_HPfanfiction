For the life of me I cannot understand why this topic hasn't received more attention from fans.

It should be entirely the other way around, with Snape painfully obviously acting like the redeemed Death Eater he wants everyone to think he has become. Instead, Rowling shows us a Severus Snape that is consistently behaving like a supporter of blood purity who shows flashes of the more extreme convictions of Voldemort supporters. How come that the one person who fought against all that and saved him from Azkaban in the end simply accepts this?

If I were Voldemort and heard about Snape's actions and behavior in school - which wouldn't surprise me, since the wizarding community is small and the guy is by far the most hated teacher in Hogwarts - I would seriously rethink his position among my followers. From this perspective you have to speculate at the reasons why Dumbledore would keep Snape around in a school of all places, why him behaving almost like a Death Eater is worth accepting. Snape must obviously do something very important for Dumbledore to be allowed this much leeway ... and from there it is not difficult to conclude he's spying for the other side as a double agent.
