I like to think that no matter how hard you try you can't justify being cruel.

(There are probably lots of examples like:Torture him or we kill you. But lets ignore that.)

I like Snape as a character, I really do but what he did, he did because he was a petty, cruel, angry man who had drawn the short straw in life and made lots of mistakes. This is just the cause, it does not justify his actions.
