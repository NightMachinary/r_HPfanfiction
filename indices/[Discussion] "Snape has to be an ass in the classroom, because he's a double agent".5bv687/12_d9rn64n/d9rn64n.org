Snape is classic Nice Guyâ„¢. He was friends with Lilly, and was nice to her, and expected her to reward him with her reciprocated love. It wasn't enough to be friends. Then, when she doesn't, he does that creepy basement dweller thing and gets bitter and resentful at the rest of the planet. You're not going to always get the one that you have idolised and put on a pedestal. The healthy person response is to close that chapter of your life, find someone else to shag, and move on with life. It's not sit there and silently stew and hate the rest of the world because you were denied.
