I mean, if you go back and read The Prince's Tale, the Nice Guy narrative doesn't really fit his character arc. He never makes any romantic advances toward Lily (regardless of the nature of his feelings) and their falling out after the lake fiasco is very pointedly about his burgeoning Death Eater leanings, fascination with the Dark Arts and increasingly overt bigotry.

It honestly barely even smacks of romantic feelings to me; I think that view was partially predicated on the Men and Women Can't Be Just Friends trope and bolstered by the fact that it's more dramatic/tragic in some people's eyes.

On another note, I can't see Snape honestly being THAT much less prickly on a day-to-day basis, even pre-war. I rather got the impression that Lily kept him in spite of his abrasiveness (to a point) rather than because of any Nice Guy tendencies; she could probably have gotten that anywhere (James Potter comes to mind).
