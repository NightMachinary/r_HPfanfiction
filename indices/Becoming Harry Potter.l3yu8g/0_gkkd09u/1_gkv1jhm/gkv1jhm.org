EDIT: I tried posting this before but it appears as if it did not work because I cannot see it on this thread. So, if it is already visible below, I apologize.

--------------

I just created an account to recommend this story (Becoming Harry Potter) and was looking for a good thread to post it when I found this.

It is a shame to see that it has only 35 reviews as of right now. Do not worry, I am not the author. To write a short summary:

Harry is sorted into Slytherin, and shortly thereafter so is Ron. We are still only midway through the first year after 70 000 words, but I promise you, it does not get boring.

To the contrary actually. The author has devised a plot that is based on canon, but differs from the books in several ways. Yes, the Philsopher's Stone does exist and, until now, is a central feature of the story, but in a way different to canon. It is also not quite clear who the villain really is at this point - if it is indeed Quirell, because there are other shady characters involved as well.

Harry is more powerful in this story, but it is not really as "in your face" as it is in other stories and tastefully done.

Ron and Harry are isolated in Slytherin at least until right now, but there are a few signs of them becoming more integrated.

While I can recommend this fanfic, there are two things I am not certain about. The story is told in the first person. Usually, this is something that I avoid in fanfiction, but in my opinion the author makes it work. The author's style and prose seem to be very elaborated. I am not a native English speaker so my criticism might not be accurate, but it might just be too much at times.

Still, I think most people looking for a good fanfic that is well written, has an interesting plot, does not feature bashing but in-depth characterizations instead would be well served to give this one a try.
