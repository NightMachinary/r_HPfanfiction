First- this is a really good question.

Second- it really should be easy but most people can't tell what a good conclusion should look like. Your 'paired off and lived happily' ending is fine for a romance that starts with 'main character was lost, alone and felt doomed'. The beginning conditions should echo the ending state.

There are a couple stories out there that I feel get undeserved flack for not being complete even though they are. For example- lorddwar's Harry/Tonks classic '[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2567419/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Summer-Of-Change][HP and the Summer of Change]]' starts with Harry grieving the death of Sirius, trying to find a way to fight his enemies and know more about what he can do with magic. He yearns to dump his childlike innocence and get into the game as it were. He's also seeking revenge against Bellatrix Lestrange. Suffice to say, all these issues get resolved by the end of that summer. I've seen people complain 'He never finished the story- Voldemort is still out there and he hasn't confronted Dumbledore or anything'; defeating Voldemort or confronting Dumbledore wasn't torquing him up, though. The story stands well where it stopped.
