This was actually really useful, thank you! And you're right, I do find myself preferring endings that don't go 50yrs into the future with his grandchildren and death and whatever, writing out every last small detail. I guess the advice 'when all the problems introduced in the beginning are solved, you're done' should be more common sense, right? But it seems I'm long out of writing class. Thank you for the reminder =D
