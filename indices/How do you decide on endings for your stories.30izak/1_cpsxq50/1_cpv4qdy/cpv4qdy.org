This is definitely true. One story I've had kicking around in my head for a while involves the Order chasing down a Harry who's never known he was a wizard, and the story ends with him finally agreeing to help them against Voldemort. The story of the story is the chase, the game of cat and mouse; fighting Voldemort is irrelevant to that, and to include that afterwards would be to the detriment of the story.
