Like [[/u/Lane_Anasazi]] says it's frequently decided in the outlining stage. That being said, it's hard to overstress the importance of editing in the creative process. While it's probably too late to add a major theme when you're editing, it's possible to have ideas germinate that become excellent plot points that become themes for later chapters - and even endings.

When crafting a theme, you can't look at in a vacuum. You have to also consider possible stressors to that theme. Using Lane's example of friendship/teamwork, things won't work perfectly all the time and you need to consider how each person operates within that team, how their separate motivations can add or resolve conflicts, and how outside influences can stress the team/friendship. Often times it is these stressors or outside influences that generate the most cogent ending possible.

Great question and I think it's a really good point to consider.
