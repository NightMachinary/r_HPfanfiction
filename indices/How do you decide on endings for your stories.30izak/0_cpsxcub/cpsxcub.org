By planning them ahead of time?

Part of the outline process should be knowing what themes you're hitting in the story - those themes should resonate throughout, and generally speaking it's a good idea to have your most important theme be heavily featured in your ending. JKR did that exceedingly well in canon.

In essence, the end of the book is where the main conflict is resolved. The way it's resolved should feel thematically consistent with the rest of the story. Example: if you've been showing how the good guys succeed because teamwork and trusting each other are really important, don't have the hero go lone-wolf rampage in the end - make the way he or she wins absolutely rely on friends, and trusting those friends to handle some important aspect of the plan.

It's honestly not that hard. I feel like too many people tend to go over the top with endings with a huge twist or something "epic" that ends up feeling like it's coming out of left field (because it is.) Endings don't have to be surprising, they have to be satisfying. Don't overthink it.
