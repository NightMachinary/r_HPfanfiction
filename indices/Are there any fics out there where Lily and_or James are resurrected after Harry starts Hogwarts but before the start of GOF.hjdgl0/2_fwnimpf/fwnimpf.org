Lucky Strike by Speedy Tomato has Lily and James showing up when Harry is 16 1/2 or so but he never when to Hogwarts [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600097364]]

Tisiphone's Child by Speedy Tomato has Remus grabs Harry and goes through the Veil after Sirius. Four people are resurrected right after Harry turns 17 and it might not be a good thing for the Wizarding World. [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600098455]]

Neither are before GOF, but are good mature rated stories with multi resurrections.
