None that I've noted.

In linkffn(Away and Back by Teddylonglong), Harry starts working to bring them forward in time, rather than back from the dead, prior to the start of GOF, but they don't come back until the Tournament is underway.

In linkffn(The Substitute by BajaB), they never died, but were trapped in another dimension. Also not prior to GOF.

They are resurrected in linkffn(Blood Binding by SphinxScribe), but it's at the graveyard in Little Hangleton.
