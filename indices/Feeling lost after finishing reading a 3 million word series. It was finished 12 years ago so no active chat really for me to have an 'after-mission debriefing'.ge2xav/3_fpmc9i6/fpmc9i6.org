This isn't going to help you with that daze, but it might be of some interest! Lightning On The Wave is also the author of like 300 essays about fiction writing. Most are really interesting reads, even if you don't necessarily agree with her: [[https://curiosityquills.com/limyaael/]]

Tat feeling of being inside a world is unlike any other, though :) A little disorienting once you're out of it, but one of the really wonderful things I love about books. I think I got it more when I was a kid, because reading took me so much longer, but absurdly long fan fictions are certainly another way to regain that sense of time spent somewhere!
