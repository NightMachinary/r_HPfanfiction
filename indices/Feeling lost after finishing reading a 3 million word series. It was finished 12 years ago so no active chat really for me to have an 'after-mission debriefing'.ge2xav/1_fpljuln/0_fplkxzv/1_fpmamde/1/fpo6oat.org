The relationship is definitely present once you get into the later fics, and though there aren't all that many explicit scenes there are some. (Though by the standards of fanfiction I don't remember them being THAT explicit). Its a pretty plot-heavy series too, so you could skim over quite a bit of the romance scenes if you wanted.
