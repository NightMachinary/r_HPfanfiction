I see this story being recommended a lot around here. I generally dislike slash a lot on the main characters. Do you think I should go for it? Or is the romance on the more down low and not really the main point with explicit scenes being described all the time? I am kind of a sucker for the wbwl trope and I would really like to read one new (new yo me at least).
