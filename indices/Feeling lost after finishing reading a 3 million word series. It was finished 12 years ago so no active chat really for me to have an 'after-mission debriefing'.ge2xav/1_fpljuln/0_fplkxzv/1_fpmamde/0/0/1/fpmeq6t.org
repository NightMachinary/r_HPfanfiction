The majority of slash readers are apparently straight women.

One of the reasons for that is because the interaction between the characters can happen without gender roles or stereotypes and a person gets to be themselves, rather than 'the girl' or whatever.

The focus of the story is the psychological motivations of the characters but as on real life, sexuality affects real life and isn't a specific segment.

In any case books 1-4 I think don't have slash, so you could read to that point.
