Ha! I've described that feeling as riding a wild rollercoaster that suddenly dumps you off in your cubicle on a normal workday, surrounded by ringing phones and muffled conversations. So disorienting.

I loved that series and still consider a lot of it to be head canon, but I don't know if I could read it again for how dark it got with how the horcruxes had to be destroyed.
