A few in which Tom Riddle is tortured (mentally or physically):

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3459731/][The Two Body Problem]] by Tozette - (Complete, login to Ao3 to read) Ginny gives the Diary to Hermione in year two.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8742878/1/Temperance-and-the-Tower][Temperance and the Tower]] - (DEAD) Heavily AU fic in which Hermione is a transfer student to Hogwarts during Tom Riddle's 6th year. Tom underestimates how badly Hermione will react to his dangerous obsession.

In which Tom Riddle is seriously injured:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13126915/1/Diablerie][Diablerie]] - (In progress, updates frequently) - Tom Riddle is accidentally transported to Harry's present in the midst of a harrowing summer of surviving the Blitz in London.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13103526/1/Birds-of-a-Feather][Birds of a Feather]] - (In progress, updates frequently) The injury is in a recent chapter, so quite a ways into the fic.

Other

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11185107/1/Stepbrother][Stepbrother]] - (In progress) AU fic in which Hermione is born the same year as Tom Riddle. Her parents adopt him, and Tom proves to be a very difficult brother to live with. The plot eventually ventures into some weird blackrom territory, so I'm usually hesitant to recommend it, but it fits the request.
