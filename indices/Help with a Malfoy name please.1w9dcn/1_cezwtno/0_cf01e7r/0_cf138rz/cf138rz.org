It seems to me that Astronomical bodies are a Black family tradition and the Malfoys use names that are significant either to Greek or Roman history. There's much more evidence for the blacks than the Malfoys obviously, since I can only remember two "Pure Malfoy" names from canon (Abraxas and Lucius)

The interesting thing here is that Draco was named in the Black tradition rather than the Malfoy one, and continued to practice that with his own son. So either the Malfoy tradition is unimportant enough that they bow to the coolness/history of the Black tradition, or the Malfoy family itself is unimportant enough that they bow to the Black tradition. That makes sense if "Ancient and Noble House" actually means anything.

To actually answer your question, though: Draco's sister would most likely be named in the Black tradition for the same reason that Draco would. One of the closest constellations to Draco is Ursa Minor, or little bear. Ursula is a name that means little bear. So unless you object to the name Ursula, that may be your best bet.

If you want her to symbolically be on the other side of the galaxy from Draco, maybe Carina would be a decent choice.
