Not all Malfoys had stellar names, but some names had suggestive / ominous overtones. Examples include Narcissa, Brutus, Lucius, Draco. The names of Greco/Roman deities also seems to be common. Some ideas:

Octavia, Anathea, Pandemia, Hecata (Magic), Lilith, Euthenia, Cephissia, Despoena, Lyssa (Rage), Macaria (Blessed Death), Megaera (The Jealous One), Nemecissia (too obvious?), Poena (Punishment), Thalia, Bellonna (War), Invidia (Envied), Tempestra (Storm)

There are some good ideas here, I think:

Also the Roman goddesses. I think that's what J.K. did, along with a few alterations to make the names sound better.

Ooo! Edit: Nefaria. Insidia.
