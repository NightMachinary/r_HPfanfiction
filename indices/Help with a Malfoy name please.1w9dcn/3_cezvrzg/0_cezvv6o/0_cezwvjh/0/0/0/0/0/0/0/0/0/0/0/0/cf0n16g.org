It depends what you want. Some do it all: check for spelling errors, check punctuation, tell you when something isn't good, tell you to add more description to this paragraph etc. Some know canon really well and will tell you if you have something totally off, or if there is a better spell to use etc. If you read the beta profiles they tell you what they like to do. It's good criticism sometimes. I have chapters that my first beta sent me back and basically told me to rewrite and those chapters are now some of my best work.
