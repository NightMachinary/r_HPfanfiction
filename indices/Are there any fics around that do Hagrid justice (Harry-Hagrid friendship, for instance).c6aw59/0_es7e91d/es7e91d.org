I mean, obligatory linkffn(Lesson With Hagrid) recommendation is obligatory, but that's not very much. The thing with Hagrid is that everybody loves him in theory, but he's terribly hard to write; first because of his accent, which, like all phonetically-spelled accents, is a pain; second because it's very hard to find him a decent place in a plot.
