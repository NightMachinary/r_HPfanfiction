Can be done different? Yes, and it can also work just as well but not if currency doesn't even make sense! Why 17 silver sickles to a galleon? Why 29 knuts to a sickle?

Yes, the wizard world is backward (so I fully understand people who've been raised by muggles complaining about that!) - but they can get away with it (magic lets you do that), sure stuff doesn't have to make sense, but if you grew up with stuff (like 100 pence make 1 pound or 100 cents make 1 dollar!) then you'd consider wizard money very very very strange (because to you it doesn't make sense at all!)

Still, I can understand why you wouldn't constantly want to read that muggles are so much better (they aren't, sure stuff makes more sense in the muggle world, but muggles also depend on technology to do things that wizards do with the wave of a wand, some concentration/visualisation and a few muttered words (or without, if they silent-cast))
