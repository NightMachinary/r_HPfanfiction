There is no gender or racial discrimination in the Wizarding world (Kingsley has a important position, so do Madam Bones) while there was a lot of racism in the 90's. The muggle world is a lot more backwards than the Wizarding one. Wizarding culture only appears backwards if one want to see it backwards. A character like Hermione would never admit that the muggle world is inferior to the Wizarding one.
