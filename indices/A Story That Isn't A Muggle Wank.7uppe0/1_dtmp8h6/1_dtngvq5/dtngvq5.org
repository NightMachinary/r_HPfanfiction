This rather misses the point of the magical world as an allegory of the Muggle one. Every problem JK Rowling gives to magical society is an analogy of a problem she considers Muggle society to have.

They have different problems, but analogous ones. Discrimination - magical world has no gender discrimination, but does have its own forms of discrimination. Corruption - magical government is at times corrupt, at times incompetent, at times bureaucratic, like the Muggle one. Justice - magical society allows injustices to happen, as Muggle society does. Etc.

Ultimately I think most of the sense of backwardness largely comes from the fact that they wear robes. But even that isn't really backwards - at no point in Muggle history were robes the common dress of the people.
