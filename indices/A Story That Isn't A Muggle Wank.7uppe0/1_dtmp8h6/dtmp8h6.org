But, the thing is, wizards /are/ backwards. Sorta. Their culture is divergent from muggle culture and the points on convergence are a minimum of decades out of date, centuries for most things, simply because wizards live longer. It takes longer for the last generation to die out and stop being a negating influence on the next generation. So even if a muggleborn /does/ become influential, they can't really influence society until decades after they left the muggle world.

But at the same time, wizard culture is /different./ It's similar enough that it all looks backwards to the newly arrived muggles, but it's mostly going to be just different.

It's the classic "barbarian" problem. Everyone thinks everyone outside of their own culture is a barbarian. Only in this case, the culture is similar enough that they're viewed as merely backwards, rather than as uncultured swine.

Similarly, witches and wizards /aren't/ logical. Logic has very little to do with their world. They live in a world where 11 year olds learn how to turn matches into needles. They live in a world where your average high school student is expected to be able to reshape reality to their whims. How does logic play into that?
