My point was just think how mad Hermione would have been to be taking classes with Luna and seeing her being unorthodox and actually doing a good job. She's already rubbed the wrong way by Luna because of her conspiracy theories: the last thing she wants is for /that/ girl, of all people, to do /better/ than her.

I'm presuming that Luna is probably good at classes like Potions, Charms, and Divination (the latter of which Hermione hates, as you'll recall) - the kinds of subjects in which success tends to be based off of improvisation and insight, rather than just precision and repetition.
