The /Sacrifices Arc/ seven-book series by Lightning on the Wave, which starts with /Saving Connor/ (linkffn(2580283)). It's an AU where Harry is raised pureblood, along with other changes. The series deeply explores Light and Dark magic and the cultures of the followers of each, without portraying all Dark magic followers as evil.
