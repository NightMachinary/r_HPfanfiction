linkffn(6671596) - This tackles the issue you're describing, and expounds on the pureblood's/magical's side on the argument. Harry is on the side of the purebloods, but is also friends with muggleborn Hermione. He's not discriminating against muggles/muggleborns, he's just of the opinion that the 2 worlds are just inherently different and has merits on both sides. The wizarding world is more discriminatory against muggles/muggleborns.
