It comes back to the old argument of magic vs technology. The outcome depends upon who strikes first. The imperius curse will cripple any organized resistance, but so would sudden airstikes like during the Six Day War. Logically speaking Wizards have no reason to fear muggles and at the same time it is just easier to stay undetected instead of widespread use of mind control.
