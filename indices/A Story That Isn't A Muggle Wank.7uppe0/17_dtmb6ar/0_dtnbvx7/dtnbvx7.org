They're probably here because you're completely wrong and try to be smug about it.

Generally, in most cases, witch-hunters didn't manage to successfully catch wizards.

  Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognising it. On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame-Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being burnt so much that she allowed herself to be caught no fewer than forty-seven times in various disguises

  It is true, of course, that genuine witches and wizards were reasonably adept at escaping the stake, block and noose (see my comments about Lisette de Lapin in the commentary on “Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump”). However, a number of deaths did occur: Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington (a wizard at the royal court in his lifetime, and in his death-time, ghost of Gryffindor Tower) was stripped of his wand before being locked in a dungeon, and was unable to magic himself out of his execution; and wizarding families were particularly prone to losing younger members, whose inability to control their own magic made them noticeable, and vulnerable, to Muggle witch-hunters.

It was to the degree that the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy was created at the end of seventeenth century, despite witch-hunts starting around three hundred years earlier.

It says something that among reasons given for enactment ISOS we see "increasing numbers of Muggles being burned in mistake for witches". Worth noting is also the "failure of (...) delegation to muggle King and Queen (William and Mary) begging for protection under muggle law" (both from W.O.M.B.A.T.).

Wizards tried to play ball with Muggles, but as those refused, and largely were hurting themselves in the process, wizards decided to withdrawn from society. Of course not everybody was fine with such "nice" solution and there were those who proposed outright war (Pottermore: Pure-Blood). And it's a war they would clearly win.

I won't get into the specific abilities. It's simple if you are in the position to almost perfectly hide your society from the bigger society to the degree that in the future its whole existence is thought to be false, then you are in the position to screw over that bigger society.
