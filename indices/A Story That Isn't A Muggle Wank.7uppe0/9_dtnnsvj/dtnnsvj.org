linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux)

It's something else. Sometimes it feels like its written from a pit of depression the author can't escape, but the quality is alright. Magic is pretty good, and the Muggle theme is explored at times. I seem to remember a very good debate in this, somewhere near the end.

The sequel steps on a very thin line, and I think the author was drunk when he wrote in a foreign girlfriend for a side-character, she working with trying to fuse technology and magic. We also get some weird butchery of Japanese superstition, but it passes quickly. In the most recent chapter Harry and another character is talking about Earth's carrying capacity and what to do about it. Let's just say the suggestions are definitely not muggle-wanky and it promises an interesting moral debate and conflict in the coming chapters.
