My own Dawn of Darkness will deal with different magical cultures in Europe and I don't intend to depict them as backwards. There will be certain aspects which the reader might consider so (use of torture for interrogation for example), but there won't be any in story moments where someone says that the magical world is a shithole because they still do that kind of stuff. There is however the canon typical corruption where you can bribe your way out of Azkaban and Tonks quits her job because of it.
