The thing is, the wizarding world ~is~ backwards. They have electricity issues, and everything awesome about our lives in modern society hinges on electricity. I'm going to be honest here, if I have a choice of having magic, or having constant access to the internet, I'll need some time to make up my mind. Now if I could have both, no brainer. But if just having my surface pro around me all the time causes it to die? And I can't get a wifi signal?

Dude.

Today the only thing that really matters is how we entertain ourselves. We don't fight for our lives, or even survival. We just exist, going to work, eating, sleeping and #(&L;ing. It's all bout filling those hours outside those activities with that which makes us happy. For me, it's motorcycling and reading. Given the computerization of my bikes, I don't think magic use would make them happy. And all my reading is electronic.
