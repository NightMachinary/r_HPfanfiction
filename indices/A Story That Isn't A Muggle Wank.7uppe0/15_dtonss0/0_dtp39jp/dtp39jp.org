Not having electricity doesn't make them backwards. Maybe by our standards, but it's not fair to apply our standards to a different species/race.

I would choose magic, and I would probably try to find some method besides the Elixir Of Life and horcruxes to become immortal. And then I'd start placing uninhabited islands and other remote locations under very powerful wards so that only I know of their location. I'd create my own society with an emphasis on education.

Yeah, I'd take magic over modern electronics any day.
