To be honest, if managed correctly Ã  population will accept almost anything. The WW in particular is ripe for the development of a 1984 type of situation. They have a state that already pries into the private lives of citizens, and nobody seems to object to this. They have a badly corrupt legal system and a police force that has shown itself willing to make use of terror tactics in the pursuit of justice (Aurors in VW1, Sirius Black imprisoned without trial for 12 years). They have a small and insular community with a credible outside threat.

To top it off they have had two devastating wars in eighteen years, one of which included a total ministry coup. During which time, it has to be said, there is no sign that the community as a whole resisted in any meaningful way when measures such as the Muggleborn Registration Committee was implemented. Not to mention that the media is under the control of the government (witness the stories printed about HP during OotP)

To sum up: the population is small, already used to restrictive government, scared, and apparently unwilling to stand up to the government.

In addition, if we take into account what Sirius said about pureblood families being interrelated, there might actually /be/ a noticeable problem with fertility and other issues associated with inbreeding among pureblood families.

If the Ministry hit the right note (and I can see a number of plausible hooks - losses in war, building up the population, a duty to breed) I don't think it's unlikely that laws regulating or mandating marriage might not only pass, but be widely embraced by a population with a 'Ministry Knows Best' attitude.
