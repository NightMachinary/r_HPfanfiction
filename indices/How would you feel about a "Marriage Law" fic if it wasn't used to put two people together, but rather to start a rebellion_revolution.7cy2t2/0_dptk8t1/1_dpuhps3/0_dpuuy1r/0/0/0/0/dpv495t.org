You are assuming that the British Ministry of Magic was competent and powerful.

But if that were the case, it would have crushed Voldemort's uprising long time ago with Dumbledore's help. In a position of strength, it could actually pass some very controversial legislations.

The situation after Voldemort's fall was however exactly the opposite. Voldemort, even with the full might of a Ministry under his control, was crushed at Battle of Hogwarts. The center of power had already shifted to the DA and the Order, who both answered to Harry Potter. If the Ministry was still stupid and insane enough to push through something like a marriage law, it would have signed its own death warrant.
