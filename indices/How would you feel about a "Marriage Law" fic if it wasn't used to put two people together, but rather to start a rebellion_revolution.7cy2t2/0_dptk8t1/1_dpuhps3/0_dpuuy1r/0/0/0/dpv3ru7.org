Harry and his friends might not be but the rest of the population most certainly /is/.

And one of the dangers that dystopian fiction makes clear is the /insidious/ nature of many of these governments. In a succesful scenario ending in a totalitarian dystopia, the government will take a frog in a pot approach, eroding small freedoms one by one, testing their control of the population, until eventually, all unnoticed, the private lives of ordinary citizens are in the hands of the creeping bureaucracy of an authoritarian state. By which time it is generally too late - by the time the general population becomes aware that they are essentially prisoners of a police state, they have been so conditioned to obey, and had so many freedoms, rights, and powers stripped from them that effective resistance is difficult if not impossible.

As I said in my first comment, the WW has many of the ingredients necessary for a dystopian regime to occur already in place - one might actually say that the WW already /is/ a dystopia, considering the human rights abuses that we are explicitly informed of by the canon.

And bringing this back to the MLC, one of the primary features of any dystopian government is that it brings citizens' private lives under the control of the state. As a real-world example, consider the laws against racial intermarriage in Apartheid South Africa, which prohibited certain forms of marriage and breeding. If /those/ laws could be passed in a real world country with a nodding acquaintance with democracy, is there any reason to say that a law compelling certain forms of marriage /could never pass/ in the WW?

I'm not saying that a Marriage Law would be the first step, but once you've got a population that is used to having certain freedoms curtailed, fed on government propaganda and properly paranoid against the inimical Other (in the WW, that would be Muggles obviously) as well as recidivists in their own midst, a Marriage Law of the type specified by the challenge would definitely be viable.

Fuck, now I want to write a properly dystopian MLC fic. Dammit. Why do I do this to myself?
