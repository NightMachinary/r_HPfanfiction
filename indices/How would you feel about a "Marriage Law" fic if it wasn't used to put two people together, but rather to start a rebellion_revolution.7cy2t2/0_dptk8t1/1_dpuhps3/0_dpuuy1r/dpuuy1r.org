As I said before, if they tried that when Voldemort was still around and heroes were weak, then exodus was indeed the most likely option.

But forcing couples together after the War, do you really believe the Muggleborns would put up with that shit so soon after surviving a genocide? Do you really believe that the DA, the Weasleys, the Longbottoms, and Hogwarts students who had just suffered and bled so much would let cowardly and corrupt Ministry rule over their fates?

Gimme a break!
