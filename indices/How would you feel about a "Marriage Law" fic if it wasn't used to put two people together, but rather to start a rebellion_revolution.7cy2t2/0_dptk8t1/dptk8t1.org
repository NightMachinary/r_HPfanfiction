If they passed the law before Voldemort's defeat, before our heroes really got strong, the most likely outcome would be an exodus, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/][Escape]], linkffn(11916243).

But if they tried to pull the same crap on the Vanquisher of Voldemort, then violent revolution would be most likely. Maybe Harry wouldn't go as far as in "Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution", but significant bloodshed should be expected.

Good guys could only be pushed so far.

The author of NOFP wrote an (anti) marriage law fic in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2612901/1/There-s-Always-a-Way][There's Always a Way]], linkffn(2612901). Basically, Harry was badly hurt after his win over Voldemort and was in no shape to fight the Ministry. So, he hired some super assassin (SI) from America to take out those responsible for the marriage law.

Bobmin356 wrote the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4960536/1/The-Obligatory-Marriage-Law-Fic][The Obligatory Marriage Law Fic]], linkffn(4960536), in which a super!Harry took out those responsible by himself.

Another [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5802874/1/The-Obligatory-Marriage-Law-Fic][fic with the same title]], linkffn(5802874), has him going full serial killer mode on prospective brides. (I disagree very much with this approach. I mean if he was willing to kill, why choose potentially innocent girls over CERTAINLY GUILTY politicians?)

Honestly, the 'marriage law trope' was an utterly brain dead idea cooked up by delusional shippers who wanted to force their favorite characters together. They had no sense of how real world people would respond to that kind of shit. As for governments wanting to stimulate population growth, tax incentives, child credits, and other privileges are the way to go.
