  I think destabilizing the Ministry is too damaging for the Wizarding World.

You gotta be kidding me! If the Ministry was willing to go that far, then it would be the /destabilizing/ factor of Magical Britain, and it would be the Problem. Burning it down and rebuilding it from the scratch was the /best/ option.

Even in the Books, this Ministry fell to two coups/revolutions within 10 months. What legitimacy would this piece of shit have in any society? It was already exposed as a paper tiger and laughing stock. And suppose this piece of shit still hadn't learnt its lessons and dared to push through something as insane as a marriage law, what do you think the Vanquisher of Voldemort was going to do?
