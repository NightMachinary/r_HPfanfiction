Would be cool if you could involve Ed and Lorraine Warren from the conjuring movies. They could be squibs or normal muggles trying to deal with haunted stuff/possessed people and Harry and Fleur could come in to save the day.

You could use Harry's master of death status to aid him in this profession. I would envision he would have power over ghosts, spirits, ... and his proficiency in defense against the dark arts would also come in handy.

Fleur could be the brains of the duo. Doing all the necessary paperwork and maintaining the contacts with the ICW/local ministries, ... You could have her be much more sensitive to emotions/echos of emotions, because of her veela ancestry(kind of like Gabrielle in 'a cadmean victory' - chapter 33), making it easier to track demons/ghosts and having her be the compassionate ear for terrified/grieving clients.
