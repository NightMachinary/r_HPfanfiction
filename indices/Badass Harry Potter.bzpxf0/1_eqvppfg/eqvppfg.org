Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) has a Hermione like that, she runs a resistance army against the Death Eaters since the Order is useless as long as Dumbledore has to keep his reputation as a politician. She doesn't just rely on magic and still kicks butt and kills Death Eaters left and right. Meanwhile, Harry and Ron get tutoring by Moody and Dumbledore and later are pretty badass too.
