It's a tricky balance if you want an OC to be interesting without turning them into a blackhole that sucks all life from the rest of the story. I'm not going to advise against Mary Sues, though -- there are a lot of canon characters who could qualify under the anti-Sue tests, and it's a term that has something of a stifling effect on new writers. Most pro authors have probably started out writing characters who could be considered Sues (regardless of gender), so it's not exactly a sin, just part of writing.

I like to think that OCs in fic are a lot like CGI in movies: highly noticeable when bad, and a seamless part of the story when done well.

One way you can keep an OC manageable is by having someone other than your OC be the POV character -- in other words, your OC is not the lens through whom we see the rest of the story. This lowers the ability for the OC to be too clever, or too awesome -- provided that the POV character isn't [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling][shilling]] the OC to the audience.

A similar route would be having a omniscient-style narrator to place some distance between the OC and the audience. Narrators are found in more old-fashioned stories, but there are modern examples, like /A Series of Unfortunate Events/ (although Lemony Snicket is a more overt/active example).

The third route would be reading some examples of good OCs and learning from them. One favorite example that comes to mind for me is actually a Self-Insert/SI-OC from *Dreaming of Sunshine" by Silver Queen, linkffn(7347955).

The /Naruto/ fandom actually has quite a few good examples of SI-OC fics done well, though not as many flat-out OCs. For /Harry Potter/ OCs, here's a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/39ljsh/well_written_original_characters/][post]] on fics with them that people have liked.

Basically, a good OC is a lot like a good character in an original work -- someone who has depth. Depth is created through contrasting skills and flaws, and how they work with a particular character's past and personality. People who write bad OCs forget to add the flaws, or add ones that aren't really flaws: being too beautiful, or being clumsy, or being so great that people are jealous of them, just to name a few overdone and/or terrible examples.

These skills/strengths and flaws can change over time, a process that is called a "character arc," or sometimes "character development." It's mostly reserved for main characters, or ones who are vital to the plot in some way, though mini-arcs can sometimes occur for smaller characters. Most main characters will probably have some kind of arc that ends in them somehow changing (either for good or ill).

Occasionally, you can see well-written main characters who have no arc. This would make them a static character, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. In this case, the arc is shifted to either other characters (who grow and change, usually in reaction to the main character), or to the audience (who have their perception of the story and themselves change).
