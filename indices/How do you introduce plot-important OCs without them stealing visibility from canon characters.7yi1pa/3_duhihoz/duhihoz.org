I don't think it's about screen-time so much as it is about the OCs taking over the ROLES of the canon characters, or in one way or the other making the canon characters redundant. You can have an OC as a major character no problem. You can even have a very powerful OC without too many problems., but the worst OCs are the ones who watlz in to show how much COOLER they are than the canon characters and who make everything about THEM.

Broadly speaking, an OC shouldn't be more famous than Harry, or be smarter than Hermione, or better at chess than Ron, or better with plants than Neville.

Also, of course, the OC shouldn't become the center of the canon characters' lives for no reason. If they ever become close to Homer Simpson's proposed treatment for Poochie (you know the one: "whenever Poochie's not on-screen, all the other characters should be asking ‘Where's Poochie?'”) you're doing it wrong.

An OC can, however, affect the plot. In some cases they can take over one of the functions of a canon character. That's fine; adding a new character will necessarily change the story up a bit. In fact, inserting a character might change things in the long run.

Take your trio of devils, for instance. They might end up taking over some of the roles of canon characters... for example, it doesn't seem likely that Harry would take that long finding out the clue with the egg with them around, neither would he be unable to find any ways of breathing underwater and have to be bailed out by Dobby's Gillyweed.

This means both Cedric and Dobby get one less function in the story. Cedric does not need to tell Harry about taking a bath with the egg (though he still might try to, just to show off that he's a decent person who wants things to be fair), and Dobby doesn't have to steal Gillyweed for Harry. This again means that Snape can't accuse Harry of stealing Gillyweed from his office and threaten with Veritaserum, which means Harry never overhears the conversation between Snape and Karakoff... the changes are small, but they add up after a while.
