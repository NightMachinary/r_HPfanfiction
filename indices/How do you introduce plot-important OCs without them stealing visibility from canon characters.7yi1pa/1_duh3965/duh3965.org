These are wonderful ideas! If you do write these stories, it would be nice if you could message me the link.

Anyway, when you're introducing plot-important OCs, have them mentioned briefly. Then have them start setting up their task - briefly too. Slowly build up the OC until they make their confrontation. Be careful not to accidentally dive too fast, lest you need to battle writer's block when you're stuck with a giant time skip between scenes where you simply can't have a giant time skip!
