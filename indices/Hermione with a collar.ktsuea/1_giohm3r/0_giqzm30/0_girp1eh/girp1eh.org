I actually did read your story it was quite good! I am actually looking for any kind of collar story I never knew about Livery Collars tbh. In a way I am also looking for an old fic that I had read... All I remember of it is Hermione was stuck as a cat girl and Draco had written a letter to his father about her being a creature and Lucius came to the school to take her away Harry being forewarned had claimed her as a pet but didn't know about having to collar her...
