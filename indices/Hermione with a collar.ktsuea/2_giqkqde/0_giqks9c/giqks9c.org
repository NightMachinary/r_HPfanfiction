  Second Year AU. After Hermione is disowned by her magic-hating parents, the combination of a Life Debt and Harry's promise to always care for her leads to our favourite couple finding themselves in an unusual relationship and making the very best of it with the help of their friends and two sympathetic professors. Yes, Hermione wears a collar, but this is in every way a safe, sane, consensual, and age-appropriate relationship between decent people who love each other, with absolutely no humiliation, coercion, or violence and no activities more sexual than kissing and snuggling. Still, if that particular kink bothers you, you might want to go and read "On a Bright Summer Morning," "Hufflepuffs and Harmony," or "Summer of the Bundling Charm" instead.
