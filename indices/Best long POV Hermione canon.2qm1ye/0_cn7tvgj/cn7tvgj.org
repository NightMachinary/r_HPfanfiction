Three flavors of Hermione-centric fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] is Hermione's POV where she's a maths genius which translates over to Arithmancy and spell creation. The tone and genre are pretty close to canon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology]] is a bit darker, edgier Hermione-in-Slytherin fic, although it does a great job preserving Hermione's essential character.

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=661&chapno=1][Hermione, Queen of Witches]] is light and fluffy and follows canon exactly. It's diary format, where Hermione writes to a sentient diary a la Riddle, except it's a /good/ diary. I read this a long time ago but I think it was decent, if extremely light. It's long, too, covering the entirety of years 1-4.
