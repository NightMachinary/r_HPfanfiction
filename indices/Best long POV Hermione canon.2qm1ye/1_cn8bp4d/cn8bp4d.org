[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1994264/Vera-Rozalsky][Vera Rozalsky's]] Four o'clock in the Morning (complete) or Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation (in-progress) are both good, long-form Hermione POV stories that are almost entirely canon-compliant and are set post-DH. Be warned, Amends includes some BDSM kink (though you can skip it and still enjoy the story) and both feature Draco, though not in a heavy-handed or implausible way.
