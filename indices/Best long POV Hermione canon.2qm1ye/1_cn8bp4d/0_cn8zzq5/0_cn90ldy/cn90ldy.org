Ron gets better, though I agree he swings a bit OOC at the beginning of Amends. And not sure how far you read but there's a subplot in Amends that goes a ways towards explaining Ginny.

As for the rest I suspect the author was influenced by this pair of essays: [[http://www.redhen-publications.com/weasleys.html][one]] [[http://www.redhen-publications.com/molly.html][two]]

It's a take that I don't personally agree with, but it is at least plausible based on canon. Just very uncharitable.
