I like fics that unsettle me so I don't know if that's your cup of tea but the two Hedric fics I've enjoyed that are not /too/ popular so you may not have read them

This is probably my fav Hedric fic. It follows a mentally unstable Cedric who becomes obsessed with Harry. I like my obsessive romances.

The second one's linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13622355]]) it's about a Cedric who doesn't really have moral qualms and sets about wooing Harry because he wants the best of everything for himself.

Hope you enjoy!
