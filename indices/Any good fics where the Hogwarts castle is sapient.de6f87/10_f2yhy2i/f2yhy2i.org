[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12132374/1/Six-Pomegranate-Seeds][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] is incredibly good and comes with a bit of time travel, grey!Hermione who technically is a Slytherin but not really, and delves super deep into possible lore, which is always the best. I fully recommend it, it's been high on my favourites list from the beginning, and there's a sequel being written right now that deals with the aftermath of the war.
