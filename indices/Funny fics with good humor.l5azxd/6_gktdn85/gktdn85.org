There are five fics that I love that I haven't seen recommended below. They are well written with great stories, balancing humor and plot advancement well. Seventh Horcrux and Black Comedy have been recommended by others, but they would be my top two recommendations for this request.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/825875][All Life is Yours to Miss]]: Professor Malfoy's world is contained, controlled, and as solitary as he can make it, but when an act of petty revenge goes horribly awry, he and his trusty six-legged friend are thrown into Hogwarts life at the deep end and must learn to live, love and let go. (Complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2304488][Draco Malfoy: Toilet Supremo]]: It must be a vision brought on by eating cheese sarnies too close to bedtime, Harry thinks. There's no way that Draco Malfoy can really be standing on his doorstep, calling himself a Toilet Supremo, and expecting Harry to buy not only this unlikeliest of scenarios, but also a new loo. But no: Harry's eyes do not deceive him. Malfoy, Lord of Toilets, is really there. Which begs a very important question: what the hell is he up to, and what evil scheme is he about to unleash? Because there must be an evil scheme . . . mustn't there? (Complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22022296][Blood Crest]]: Nine-year-old Harry accidentally apprentices himself to a necromancer. Things go downhill from there. (This one is heavier on plot than humor, but still pretty damn funny. Regularly updated WIP)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]]: As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job. (This is for fans of the Absurdist philosophy. Still a regularly updated WIP with 425,194 words)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19312162][The Devil You Know]]: All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better. It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas. (first part is completed, second part is regularly updated WIP)

Happy reading!
