Lily and the Art, etc, is excellent and I second this recommendation. I'd also like to point out that pretty much everything else on the author's page is well worth reading, including several alternate universe versions of Lily, such as one which puts her in the Naruto universe, another where she journeys to the Star Wars verse, and even some side stories where she goes back in time.
