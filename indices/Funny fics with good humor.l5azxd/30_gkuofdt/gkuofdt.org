Once upon a freakin time is, for me, one of the best fanfics i've read (Also, sรณ, you've decided to be evil, by the same author, but this is incomplete)

Other that i love include, Dear order, All the Dementors of Azkaban, How Lucius Malfoy Accidentally Destroyed the World, Dear tom (only accessible by the page of Harry Potter crack fics on TV tropes), and Lets do the Time Warp Again

these are some of the ones I remember now, if I remember more I update the comment later
