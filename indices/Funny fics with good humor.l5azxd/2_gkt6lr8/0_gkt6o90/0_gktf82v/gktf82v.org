Not anymore it's not. I mean, nostalgia makes them /seem/ pretty good, but when I went back to check one I remembered enjoying, it just ... fell apart. Looking through a few more of their stories, there seems to be a trend where they start out as a fun little thing, crack-adjacent if not outright, and then gradually steer right off the edge of crack and into the valley of insanity. And not the dada kind either, but instead that dull, boring insane, like trying to read that script in The Shining. Sure, you can look past all the flaws that keep piling up, but at that point why not read something better? The fandom's evolved. We've got actual professional level writers who get barely a hundred views.
