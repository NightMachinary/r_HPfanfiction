Oh. My god. Yes. Funniest fanfiction I know, and also with amazing world-building and characters and plot, it's just gorgeous.

linkao3(survival is a talent by ShanaStoryteller)

It BEAUTIFULLY written and the humor is on point. It's a soulmate fic, but it doesn't focus on it, it's just the catalyst to all sorts of amazing friendships and adventures. It's perfect.

Unfortunately, it isn't finished, but I think it updates pretty regularly.

It's so good.
