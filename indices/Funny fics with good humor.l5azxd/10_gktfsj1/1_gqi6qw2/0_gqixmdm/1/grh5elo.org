Hey, just finished reading linkffn(Harry Potter, Geek of Magic) and although it is not as funny as the other two, it also feels very wholesome and nice to read. Harry's personality is very different to canon and his friendship with the gryffindors has a very nice dynamic. It is also incomplete but I thought maybe you would like it :)
