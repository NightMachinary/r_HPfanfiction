Not really. Fics like that and Harry the Hufflepuff is a pretty high bar to set. I really hope it updates again soon as I could do with a laugh. Remembering McGonagall getting teleported outside the window makes me smile even now.

There are some funny fics I can recommend, none are hidden gems like that one though:

linkffn(Where in the World is Harry Potter? by nonjon) and its sequels I remember being hilarious but it's been a long time since I read them.

linkffn(Amalgum -- Lockhart's Folly by tkepner) has Harry's soul travelling back in time to save the world but ending up merged with Lockhart in second year.

linkffn(Healer Harry - A Fanfic by SalTalStudios) is basically a Harry Potterish version of the TV show House focused on clinic hours.

linkffn(Inspected By No 13 by Clell65619) I can't really remember other than Voldemort being offended at being called a "necromantic abomination".

linkffn(Lessons with Hagrid) is a little oneshot with a good ending.

linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes) is famously recommended a lot on this sub.

linkffn(Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise by AutumnSouls) is incomplete and not funny in a light-hearted like the others way but there's a lot of fem!Harry being sarcastic to Dumbledore/Fleur/Karkaroff etc. that can be entertaining.
