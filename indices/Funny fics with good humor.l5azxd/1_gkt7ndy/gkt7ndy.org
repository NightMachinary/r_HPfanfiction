Can't work out how to link from phone but.

When in doubt obliviate- Lockheart raises Harry, I particularly like the characterisations of Lockheart and Neville.

Like a red headed step child- Harry has red hair and keeps getting mistaken for a Weasley, he doesn't mind.

Harry the Hufflepuff- Harry is really lazy and keeps finding innivative ways to avoid work

Seventh Horcrux- a favourite here, Voldemort is possessing Harry, or Harry has Voldemort's memories its never clear which it is but funnier than the summary makes it seem.

Oh god not again!- a redo fic Harry falls through the veil and gors back to his 11 year old body.
