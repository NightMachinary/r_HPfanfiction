  Daphne Greengrass was walking in the dungeons to her dormitory. She was reputed to be the most beautiful witch in the castle. Her black hair flowed over her shoulders and only stopped at the middle of her back. Her blue eyes promised pain to everyone that dared to mess with her. Her figure was perfect, something that was not well known since the school robes hid a lot. That is one thing Daphne was grateful for. Otherwise she would have even more attention.
