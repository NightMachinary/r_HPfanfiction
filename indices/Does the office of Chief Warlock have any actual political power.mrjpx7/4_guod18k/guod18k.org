Im pretty sure that if he had the power to keep snape ( a MARKED death eater) out of Azkaban, he could have had the power to get Sirius a trial (at the end of the first war) or at least visited him at prison to ask him questions ? Or enquire about how the whole thing happened ? Surely he knew Sirius had no trial, wasn't he at least curious about why, and how he told the secret? To whom ? Was it to Voldemort directly ? When ? I mean sorry but Dumbledore just assuming Sirius told it is so dumb. Yes he thought he was secret keeper, but honestly even if he was really a death eater he should have been questioned, asked to give names, etc.. So yes in my opinion Dumbledore was very much a hypocrite. Im sure he wouldn't have bothered with Snape if he didn't know he would need him later.
