I had an AU prompt idea once that played off the fact that "warlock" originally meant "oath-breaker" where the original role of the Chief Warlock was to break magical bonds or oaths that were no longer desired or were impossible to fulfill. In particular, his intervention was needed for magical divorces and resolving life-debts.

Rowling wizards and witches being what they are, they kept giving the Chief Warlock additional responsibilities and eventually forgot what the job's original purpose was.
