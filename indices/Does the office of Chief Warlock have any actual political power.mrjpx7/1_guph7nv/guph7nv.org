Well the simple point with Sirus is that Dumbledore had no leadership position whatsoever in 1981. We've seen the Death Eater trials in the pensieve and Dumledore is just one of the "jury", not leading the proceedings, which is done by Barty Crouch Sr.

In POA Dumbledore also refers to having given evidence against Sirius, so it appears that some kind of summary proceedings were held in Sirius' absence, again likely under the control of Barty Crouch Sr.

I honestly doubt that Sirius being sent to Azkaban without a proper trial was illegal or even a secret. Summary justice appears to be relatively common and accepted in wizarding Britain.
