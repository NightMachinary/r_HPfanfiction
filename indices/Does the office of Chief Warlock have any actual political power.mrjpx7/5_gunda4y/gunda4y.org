When I say that Dumbledore should make release of Sirius possible, then he would even need much real political power. Considering that both /Magna Charta/ (with right of every Englishman to have “trial by jury of one's peers”) and /Bill of Rights/ (which include /Habeas Corpus Act/) should be grandfathered into the Magical Law from the English Common Law, it should be enough for him just to request the transcript of his trial. And yes, I cannot imagine that whatever really the Chief Warlock means, his powers should include at least the right to see transcripts of trials (if they are not public documents anyway).

When it wouldn't be found, Sirius should be automatically released (or if the worst political corruption happens, at least be given the trial). And I don't think there would be much opposition to it even from the darkest parts of Wizengamot, because the precedent of a member of a powerful family being thrown to Azkaban without a process, couldn't be something anybody would support.
