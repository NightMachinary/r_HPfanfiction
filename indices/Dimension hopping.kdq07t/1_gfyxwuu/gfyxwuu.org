Linkffn(The Granger Principle)

Ron centric, Hermione is the brains behind the portal, and Harry's also there. As are Ginny, Luna, Sirius, Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and the Luna from the other dimension.

Pro tip: Never put two Lunas with the same personality but very different skills in the same room unless you want chaos.
