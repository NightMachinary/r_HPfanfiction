A lot of people romanticize this notion that immortality is actually a curse, in which you have to see your loved ones die over and over again, unable to help yourself.

This is stupid. Immortality is awesome (given relative health and youth is maintained). Anyone who thinks otherwise is too influenced by religious literature that spawned the notion that death is a blessing.
