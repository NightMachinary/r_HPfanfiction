For me I imagine it would be around the point when I looked up and noticed that the Sun had turned Red and I was the only human being left that was even vaguely human looking.

Once I sobered up I'd probably wonder how I'd forgotten about leaving Earth.

But seriously... heat death of the universe is not something I'd want to experience personally as an otherwise vanilla mortal human that just can't seem to manage to kick it.
