Probably when I am unable to take care of myself. I have no desire to die of course lol, not right now. But at some point in my life I will be so old or sick that I need someone to change my diapers and feed me and roll me over. When I am in so much pain that cannot be cured via medicine or surgery (think incurable cancer etc) I would like to die.
