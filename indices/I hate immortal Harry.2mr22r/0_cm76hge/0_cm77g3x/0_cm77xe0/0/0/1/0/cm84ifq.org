That is not immortality.

You are young. You are healthy. Your mind and sanity maintains its regular course for all eternity.

When do you choose to die?

It seems to me that you never considered what it truly means to live forever, before declaring that it is not something up your alley. Take the time to really consider what it might mean to be immortal, and then reconsider your position.
