There is that...but I have lost many loved ones over the years and it makes me sad. They have mostly been older with two exceptions where they were young and that is hard. While I don't have children, I have nieces and nephews that, if i were to see them die, would probably ruin me for a long time (I am very very close with my family). From my understanding a parent never gets over the pain of loosing a child. No matter how many they have. But I am also a very empathetic person, hence the reason I feel so much when I read some of these stories! :)
