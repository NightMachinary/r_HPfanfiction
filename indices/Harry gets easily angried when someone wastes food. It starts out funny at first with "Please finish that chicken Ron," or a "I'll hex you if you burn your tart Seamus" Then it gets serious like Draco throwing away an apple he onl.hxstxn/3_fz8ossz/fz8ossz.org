“Oi! Malfoy!” Draco braces himself with a slow, deep, breath, carefully placing a smirk on his face. Though it was odd that Potter would go for him right outside the Great Hall.

“Oh Potter,” Draco sneered straightening up his spine. “Is the Mudblood so boring you must bother -“

“Why the /hell/ did you waste food!?” Potter spat fingers twitching for his wand though he didn't pull it out. The question was so startling that Draco merely gaped at Potter silently. “Well?! You think just because your rich means you can waste food? There are people going hungry every day and you think, ‘mmm I'm just going to take one bite out of this apple and throw it away'!”

“What?” Draco managed blinking in an uncultured way.

“What?! What? Oh you aren't getting out of this! If I see you wasting food one more time I'm going to hex you!” Harry spun around and began marching off, Hermione and Ron appearing right as he did so, both looking worried.

“Hey Potter!” Harry spun around to glare. “Why were you watching me eat?”

Potter left red faced without answering.
