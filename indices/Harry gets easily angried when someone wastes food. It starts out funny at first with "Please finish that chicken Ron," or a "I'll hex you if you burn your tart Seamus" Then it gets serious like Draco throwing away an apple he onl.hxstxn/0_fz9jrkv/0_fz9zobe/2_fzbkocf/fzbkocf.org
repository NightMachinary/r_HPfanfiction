Love it!

Course the idea of Harry writing to Voldemort made me think of Bobmin's [[https://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/dear_tom/dear_tom/][Dear Tom]] but yeah lol now I want to see this (preferably without a full slash, I can't see Harry going from absolute hatred to love; maybe to friendly enemies, but I've got my limits)
