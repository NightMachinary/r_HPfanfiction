Harry's scar started hurting like hell again. This time, he was crucioing Lucius and Rookwood for spilling their dinner. Harry was so full of anger from it he just straight up forced the plate, the glass cup, and all of the cutlery down their throats. He revelled in their screams of agony, and after they were done, he also forced them to eat the food on the floor. Afterwards, he kept crucioing them. Screams rocked the safe house. Harry woke up with a jolt, and he made sure to send Hedwig over with a card that said â€˜Great work Voldy! The vision was very entertaining. That should teach them why they shouldn't waste food.' Tom cackled when he got the card and kept on torturing the two condemned. Note: Idk it was fun
