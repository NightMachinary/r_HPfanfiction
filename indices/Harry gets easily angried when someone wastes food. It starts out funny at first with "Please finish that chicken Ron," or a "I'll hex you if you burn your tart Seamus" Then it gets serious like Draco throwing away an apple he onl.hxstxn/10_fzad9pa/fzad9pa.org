-Down in the chamber of secrets-

Harry was panting and running as fast as his legs could carry him. Riddle was shooting hex after hex after hex- faster than he thought anyone could duel. “Tired yet, Potter?” Riddle sneered. He conjured up a mist and transfigured it into a mist apple, took a bite, and threw it onto the ground, where it strangely kept it's shape. Harry stopped in his tracks, gasping for air. “WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?!” “Do what?” Riddle stopped casting, a confused look on his handsome face. “Duh, WASTING FOOD!” “What food?” “THAT APPLE TOM!” Riddle picked up the apple on the ground. “This thing? It isn't even food!” “YES IT IS AND EAT IT!” “No.” Riddle looked into Harry's stunned face and promptly killed him on the spot. Note: I do t have any talent for writing and this is very OOC and not-understandable. This is just for fun.
