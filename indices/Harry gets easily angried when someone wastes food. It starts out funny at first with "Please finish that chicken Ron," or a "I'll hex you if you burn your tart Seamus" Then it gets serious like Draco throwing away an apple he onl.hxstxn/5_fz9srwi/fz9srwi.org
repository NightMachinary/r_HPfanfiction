This is just a small part of the fic, but I loved this scene from a fic where Harry was made prefect instead of Ron:

  "Harry! Being a prefect is a privilege."

  "They just tell you that so you'll be excited about being a glorified hall monitor." Harry told her seriously. A slight commotion further down the table drew their attention. Several of the second years were flinging spoonfuls of oatmeal at one another.

  "/OI! Knock it off. You should all be ashamed. There are children starving in Africa who would be thrilled to have oatmeal, and here you are wasting it. Hang your heads in shame./" The kids all looked at Harry like he was insane.

  "Do I have to come down there? HANG YOUR HEADS IN SHAME."

  The kids looked at one another uncertainly and hung their heads. Harry nodded in satisfaction and went back to eating.

  A few minutes later Lavender nudged him.

  "Harry? The kiddies want to know how long they need to do that for."

  "Huh? Are you sufficiently shamed? Carry on then."

  "Harry, honestly." Hermione sighed.

  "What? Works, doesn't it?"
