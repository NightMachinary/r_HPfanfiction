*The first list is a list of prompts where I think would result in a multi-chapters story (at least 40k long) if it was brought to fruition.*

#1 - (James/Lily) - Lily Evans is a prat toward James Potter during their seventh year. She is the only one in the school (apart from Snape obviously) who hasn't realised yet that James has grown up and is far from the bully that he was in their fifth year. James hasn't even asked Lily out since the end of their fifth year and hasn't bothered her either since then. However, Lily missed that point and continued to treat him as if he was going out of his way to annoy her. One day, while James and Lily are on Head Boy/Girl duties, Lily say one thing too many to James which results in him snapping back and give his truthful opinion on her (Something like he love(d) her but is so tired of dealing with her dislike/hatred of him that he's completely giving up on his love to her and doesn't want to talk to her ever again.) The next day, James decide to give back his badge to McGonagall so that he doesn't have to deal with Lily anymore. With Remus as the new Head Boy, Lily quickly realise that she kinda miss James and feel horrible for the way she treated him, even when he was patient toward her. Lily has to find a way to reconnect with James (who is going out of his way to avoid her) and learn how to feel with her strange feelings toward him. (She likes him, maybe even loves him but she doesn't understand her feelings which could be the reason why she treated James like crap. Or it can be something else, whatever.)

​

#2 - (Harry/Hermione) - Just before his name his called for his turn in the First Task of the 1994-1995 Triwizard Tournament, Harry admit his feelings for Hermione (who sneeked in the champions' tent). In return, Hermione also tell him about her feelings toward him and the two kiss. However, Harry doesn't want to go risk his life for a stupid tournament and Hermione whole-hearthly agree that the magical world really is stupid if they don't seem to have a problem with a 14-year-old boy competing in a deadly competition. Together, just when Harry's name is about to be called (and Harry prefering his live over his magic), Harry and Hermione decide to run away from Hogwarts, both having enough with their lives being endangered. The officials and the spectators are shocked when Harry never enter the arena to face his dragon.

​

#3 - Lily Potter survived Voldemort's attack on her family but get stuck in her Animagus form of a white, Snowy Owl. In the process, Lily get separated from Harry and has no idea where her son is. (She doesn't doubt that Harry somehow ended up at her sister but has no idea where she lives as she, her husband and her son moved to a new home shortly after the Potters went into hiding.) After a few years, Lily finally gives up and resign herself to never see her son again and spend the rest of her life as an owl. In 1991, Lily somehow end up in the Magical Menagerie when Rubeus Hagrid and eleven-years-old Harry enter the shop. Lily manage to get bought by Hagrid as a gift for Harry. Harry names his new Snowy Owl Hedwig. When Harry and Lily/Hedwig are at Hogwarts, Lily manage to give a message to Harry telling him that she is human but stuck in her form. With the help of Professor McGonagall, Hedwig is finally unlocked of her transformation and both are shocked when she turns into Lily Potter.

​

#4 - Tom Riddle Sr might have abandonned the wife who drugged him with love potions but he never planned to abandon his unborn son. A few months after Merope Gaunt-Riddle ran away, Tom find his son Tom Riddle Jr in an orphanage and adopt him. Tom Riddle Sr was already aware of magic before meeting Merope because of his cousins and decide to call one of them to verify if his son is magical. Tom's cousin, Fleamont Potter shows up and check if Tom Jr is magical which he confirms. Realising that his son would be entranched in the magical world, Tom raise him with the help of the Potter family. (Tom Riddle Jr never become a Dark Lord as he knows love thanks to his father and cousins.)

​

#5 - (Harry/Hermione) - Harry already felt like it wasn't a good idea to associate with him but had always tried to ignore that feeling. After witnessing Sirius' death at the Department of Mysteries, Harry feel like he is a burden and a danger to everyone remotely close to him. The final nail in the coffin comes when Dumbledore tells him of the prophecy. Seeing it as confirmation that he is too dangerous to live with, Harry decide to run away to train, alone, while fighting Death Eaters. Of course, he couldn't do so without first leaving a letter for Hermione, admiting to her about how he had fallen in love with her but never did a move because he feared that she would be in danger. Pissed off at Harry (but mostly because she wants to be with him for every step of the way), Hermione decide to track him and find him at any cost. When they do, the couple train to fight Voldemort.
