#13 - (Harry/Ginny) - Harry and Ginny become friends in Ginny's first year but Harry is worried when Ginny become more and more withdrawn from everyone. Fortunately, Harry find Tom Riddle's diary in Ginny's belongings and put the clues together and find the truth about the Chamber of Secrets and the Heir of Slytherin and that just before Ginny is kidnapped by Tom. Harry manage to save Ginny and get the diary to McGonagall where it is promptly destroyed by Dumbledore. The whole ordeal brings the two friends closer and they both start dating the next year.

​

#14 - The summer between the trio's sixth year and before the Horcrux Hunt, the Order of the Pheonix are attacked by Death Eaters and more than half of the Order members are killed. The survivors regroup and decide to form a new, grayer faction that won't hesitate to do what is necessary to put down the Death Eaters and end the war as fast as possible, including killing if necessary. The new organisation (which has it's own name, logo and uniform) is entrusted by the trio with the secrets of the Horcruxes and together, they seek the objects out while fighting Death Eaters.

​

#15 - After Harry is locked in his room (after Dobby's intervention the summer between Year 1 and Year 2), Harry decide to use magic to escape and run away from Privet Drive because he realise that better be expelled but in good health than starved to death and attend Hogwarts later (if he made it through). The Ministry goes in a frenzy when they make it to Privet Drive to interogate Harry about the use of his magic and not only learns about his living condition at the Dursleys but that he ran away, leaving no trace behind. Meanwhile, Harry somehow end up at the Grangers (or the Weasleys but Grangers are more likely since he know how to travel in the muggle world) where he tell them the truth and request their help.

​

#16 - Something inspired by fanfictions where Lily Evans and the Marauders read the Harry Potter books but, instead, it is Harry and Ginny who read a book about their future child. They do not like what they see and decide to change the future so that their child could live an happy life. (and have siblings)

​

#17 - A fourteen years old Harry somehow travel back in time to 1980. With no way back, Harry decide to meet his younger parents and attempt to both help and save them from their fate. In the process, his parents "adopt" him and Harry become a older brother to his younger counterpart.
