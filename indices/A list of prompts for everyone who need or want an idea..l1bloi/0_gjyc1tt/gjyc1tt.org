#4 - (Fem!Harry, Warning: Rape) - During Care of Magical Creatures, the class is surprised when Fem!Harry can't approach the Unicorns as easily as the other girls. They are even more shocked when it is revealed that Unicorns are more trusting of virgin girls which results in Fem!Harry breaking down and running back to the castle. Hermione manage to find her best friend and finds out the truth: In their second year, Lockhart raped her in her detention at the beginning of the year before attempting to obliviate her.

Completely ignoring Bagman and the other officials, the Champions conjure a water tank before listening to the clue together. They rapidely get to the conclusion that they would have to save an hostage from the bottom of the lake and they show just how much they disapprove of the idea.

#8 - Minister Cornelius Fudge go undercover as a first year student during Dolores Umbrige's reign of terror and he realise just how fucked up the school is with Umbrige at its head.

​

#11 - A short story where Harry peacefully passes away in the Great Hall while everyone else is celebrating the death and defeat of Voldemort. (Just after the canonical Battle of Hogwarts, can be for various reasons just as general exhaustion or the remnant of the horcrux or whatever). His friends don't realise it until minutes later when one of them try to get Harry's attention and realise that he is unresponsive. The celebration quickly turn into mourning as his friends, the winners of the Battle of Hogwarts and the general population of the Wizarding World also go through the death of their saviour.

​

When the two start competing for Harry's affection, they realise that they actually have feelings toward the other and get together... leaving a very confused Harry and Ron behind who wanted to ask Ginny and Hermione out respectively.
