My favorite female!Harry fic definitely has to be linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) and its sequels. Fem!Harry's portrayal is really good in my opinion and the supporting characters are also quite fleshed out with even OCs being really likable (and I usually hate ocs). The plot starts out pretty slow but it eventually picks up.

Also anything with fem!Harry by Tsume Yuki is a pretty good bet (anything by her in general if I'm being honest).
