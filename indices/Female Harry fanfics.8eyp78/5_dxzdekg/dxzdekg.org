Here are a number of the ones I had bookmarked on FFnet/AO3. I remember them all to be fairly well-written. Some are complete, some are WIPs, some are abandoned (sorry).

linkao3(2757626) - Harry had a good relationship with the Dursleys & never went to Hogwarts. Story picks up when she's 17 or 18 and is kidnapped by the risen Dark Lord. (probably abandoned)

linkao3(3694820) - short little overview-type fic of Slytherin Harry

linkffn(9486886) - I LOVE this fic & recommend it whenever I can. Female Harry has an alter ego who develops+runs the criminal underground of Wizarding Britain.

linkffn(10412157) - quick little two-shot of post-war Harry needing to get married/getting married. Bad description but worth the read.

linkffn(3509002) - This is the first fem!Harry fic I ever read, so it has a special place in my heart. A 7-year re-write (in progress).

linkffn(8615605) - Very long; attempt at 7-year rewrite. Complete but with an incomplete sequel. Not bad, as far as I remember, if you can't forgive the pairing..

linkao3(3348758) - Harry has to deal with the unfortunate fact that her soulmate is Tom Riddle. (abandoned)
