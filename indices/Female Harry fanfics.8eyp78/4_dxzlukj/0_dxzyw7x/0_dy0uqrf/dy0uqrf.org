Yeah I do but I tend to actively search for female Harry more often. If you search fanfiction.net for crazyclone as a writer, you can see the stories I have read since I tend to favorite stories I have read and enjoyed so I can keep track. If you press ctrl+f and type in "fem" you can find some that have fem!harry or female Harry in the descriptions, unfortunately (or fortunately lol) it also catches the stories with femslash or female characters from other fandoms as well that I have liked. Another good way to find female Harry stories is to go to the community tab on fanfiction.net and click general. About 20 down the list is a community for fem!characters and here you can find over 8000 stories that feature a normally male character that was born, turned into, or crossdresses as a girl. That is typically where I find all of the female Harry stories.
