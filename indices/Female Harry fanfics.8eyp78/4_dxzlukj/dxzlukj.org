I love female Harry fics so this list is gonna be super long (sorry, not sorry):

linkffn(11517506) The Light vs Dark with female Harry being an underdog third group. Neville is arrogant boy who lived. James Potter was a traitor so female Harry is an outcast. Great world building. Really good, recently updated too.

linkffn(12760426) I really like this author and this is the story that is most likely to be updated although the author seems to be burned out on Harry Potter so might be abandoned like the Long Game and To Reach Without (these two are good too).

linkffn(11309061) Percy Jackson crossover. This author has 3 different female Harrys with one of the Main Three as her father. This Hades one is my favorite of these since I didn't really like the direction the other two have taken in the second story.

linkffn(12457005) Antisocial female Harry with snakes for friends and Quirrelmort as a protecter/father figure.

linkffn(12828900) Almost everyone has switched genders. Female dominated witching world where the few wizards have coven/harems or are ostracized. Femslash. Hasn't gotten to Hogwarts yet though.

linkffn(11488630) female Harry with Greek mythos, Earth magic and pirates. It's pretty good.

linkffn(12507814) Trans Harry where she transitions into a girl.

linkffn(11437578) Fantastic so far 3 part series with some good world building and pagan religious magic and holiday ritual celebrations. Highly recommend.

linkffn(11827316) Pretty good female Harry who gathers follower/minion/friends. Femslash.

linkffn(11637611) This author specializes in cracky fluffy femslash with crazy female Harrys. This one and its sequel are probably my favorites from them.

linkffn(11024296) Another Percy Jackson crossover although knowledge of Percy Jackson not really required since the story has only taken place in Hogwarts so far. It's pretty unique considering there are a lot of variations of Harry Potter with a godly parent or two.

linkffn(10942056) Time travelling female Harry is Tom Riddle's caretaker and Gellert Grindelwald has taken an interest in her. Tom gets jealous and is an adorable pre-teen. Might get weird later though since Tom and Harry appears to be the pairing.

linkffn(11197701) The start of a 3 fic realistic soul bond. Femslash. Veelas and pagan love rituals are prevalent. Same author also has a pretty good series where female Harry is Black Widow linkffn(11221015). Also femslash.

linkffn(9081608) Master of Death Harry where Harry is reborn constantly, this time in a girl's body. Very nihilistic or cynical female Harry paired with Tom Riddle.

linkffn(12383390) Good female Harry with Eragon fic. It was abandoned briefly and there exists another story with the same first couple chapters that eventually diverge since it was adopted but this was the original and re-continued.

linkffn(11602420) Female Harry is like Moriarty, Hermione is Sherlock and Neville is Watson. Femslash. Pretty good from what I remember.

linkffn(11294952) Female Harry with Wesley from Daredevil season 1. Mostly fluff but some plot.

linkffn(12026760) Hermione's mother is Muslim and the Grangers adopt female Harry after she was abused by a foster family. Female Harry ends up in Gryffindor with Hermione in Slytherin. It's pretty good.

linkffn(10412141) Really good Slytherin female Harry that builds a network of informants and allies around her. House politics. Good basilisk encounter.

linkffn(10808765) Avengers crossover that so far has focused more on female Harry traveling the world and getting Defense and Transfiguration masterys with the occasional encounter to justify the Avengers crossover. Good but not nearly updated enough.

I should probably stop lol, I could keep going but I probably went overboard as it is.
