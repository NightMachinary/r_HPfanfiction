I read Full Circle already, I was rolling on the ground from laughter, I love how they screw everyone around and especially Dumbledore's reaction to everything! it still cracks me up. I was so sad when I finished it. my only complaint is that i want more chapters lol

Bonus Points for Mod Harry!! Thank you sooo much! I don't think i have read Harry and The shadowed Light, i will start right away! Thanks again! :D
