Thank you so much! btw Time to put your galleon is an amazing fic, if you ever want to read it, anything by Tsume Yuki is Awesome.

I think I read Rebirth but I am not sure? It sounds really familiar, either way I am due for a re-read anyways.

I just started Xerosis, actually! So far so good.

Again and Again is on my reading list but i have never started it for some reason, i am just too scared of seeing dark Harry, and how that will ruin my mental image? i quite like Slytherin Harry, cunning and ambition is my thing. Nut is Harry on the verge of being not likeable? I mean like OOC? or is he just jaded?
