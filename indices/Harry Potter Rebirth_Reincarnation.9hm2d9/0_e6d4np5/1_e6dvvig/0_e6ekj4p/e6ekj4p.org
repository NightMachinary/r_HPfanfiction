honestly, it's been a while since I've read Again and Again. From what I remember, I'm pretty sure it's more Politician!Harry than Dark!Harry. The Harry in Xerosis is more dark than the one in Again and Again, so if that hasn't bothered you so far, you should be fine. The only thing that would make the Harry in Again and Again dark, I think, would be that he's anti-muggle. But there's not torture scenes or anything like that, as far as I remember.
