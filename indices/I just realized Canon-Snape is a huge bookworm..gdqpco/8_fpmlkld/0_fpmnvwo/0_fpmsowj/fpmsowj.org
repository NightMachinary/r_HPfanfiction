Sorry not yet. I have about 380k words of an expected 800k+, but probably this summer I'll be ready for a set of betas to take a hard look, and then decide if I'm sticking with this penname.

If you're ok with a fic that starts with 250 words of /content warnings/ that would get downvoted straight to hell in this subreddit, then I'll save you a seat in the handbasket! I'm also bringing references to over 100 songs from the 1990s, and weaving a "hidden" story alongside books 6 & 7.

I'll be looking for 4 kinds of beta: grammar nazi, continuity & canon-compliance checker, playlist maker, and brit-picker. Feel free to DM me if that sounds like something you'd care to work on. Otherwise, cheers on your insight to Snape's character, and thanks for the kind words on my tease :)
