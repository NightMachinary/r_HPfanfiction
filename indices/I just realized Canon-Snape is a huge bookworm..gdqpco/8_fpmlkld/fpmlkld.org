The fact that both Hermione and Snape are massive bookworms comes up a few times in my unfinished SS/OC epfic set during HBP. It's such a powerful part of both their characters that I already have most of those scenes written, so here's a little taste :)

Hermione finally produced a photograph. "I had a friend take this picture, of a spread in a book. I'm trying to find the original owner of the book."

"Er, this is from the N.E.W.T.-level Potions text. There are thousands of these around. But someone has written tips in it. That's a bit different. Huh, cat's claw oil, I knew that one!"

"Did Professor Snape teach it to you?"

Liz narrowed her eyes, but didn't take them off the photo.

"Is that his handwriting?"

Liz swallowed hard. The scrawl was a bit neater than what she was used to, but the sharp points of the S-curves and the sparse connectors in the script-type hybrid were unmistakable to her now. So, the answer was probably yes, but she said, "Maybe." Looking up, she added her own question, "Why do you need to know this?"

"If he wasn't such a total git to us Gryffindors, I'd be asking him for an apprenticeship toward Mastery."

This response was obviously rehearsed to death, but there wasn't much Liz could do if Hermione was determined to lie about it. It's not like she was being entirely truthful, herself. Lips quirking, she replied with a joking lilt, "A dunderhead notion if I ever heard one." She handed the photo back and put on a more serious tone. "Sorry, Hermione, but I've never seen this book, and believe me I have seen a lot of his books. But he is even more a bookworm than you --" Hermione scoffed, but Liz just smiled and continued, "-- so it's possible I simply haven't yet."
