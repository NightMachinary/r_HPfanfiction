  Joining a terrorist group that specifically targets her race is a wee bit much tho.

I would consider the Death Eaters more like a cult, not just a political movement. Snape had shitty friends and it was one way for him to fit in with this crowd, whether it made sense intellectually or not.

Many intelligent people join cults and quite a few struggle with mental disconnect. Especially members of violent terrorist groups don't really allow themselves to think about what they are doing, bc if they did, they would realise that their choosen path is wrong. A good example of this mental disconnect are the testaments of some of the 9/11 terrorists who flew the airplanes into the World Trade Center.
