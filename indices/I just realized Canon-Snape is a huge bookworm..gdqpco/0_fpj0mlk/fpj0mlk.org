I think he truly was a book worm, but I'm not sure that wanting to join a terrorist group means you can stop studying, regardless of what some idiot Slytherins say in the later books. Independent of what you want to be, there'll always be those who love studying, reading, knowledge, are duteous, or just like to be good at something (and Slytherins are ambitious). In every profession you'll have those who study a lot and those who get by on minimal effort. I also doubt that Voldemort paid his followers. For rich purebloods, yes, joining Voldemort might have been a full time job, but all others had to earn a living somehow. And if you want to join Voldemort and actually want to become one of his favorites, you have to have some value. You are either rich and support his endeavors, or you have to be in a useful position (as a spy or a ministry employee, etc) or you have to be powerful and good at magic. Snape wasn't going to stand out with his popularity/charisma/wealth/... He had little going for him but his intelligence. If he wanted to rise above his station, his mind was his only chance.

But I'm not even sure I'm entirely sold on his only desire being to join Voldemort at that point in time. He might have as well thought it a plan B. Something like “I'll marry Lily, but if that doesn't work out and she leaves me (low self esteem and all that) I am completely and utterly alone, then I'll join the Death Eaters.” He might have been playing it safe by keeping both Lily and his DE buddys happy, and when Lily truly did leave him (maybe even a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy), he had another option.
