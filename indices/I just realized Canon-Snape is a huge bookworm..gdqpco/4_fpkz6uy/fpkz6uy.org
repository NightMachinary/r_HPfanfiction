I just realized that while Snape would've never been a Gryffindor and Lily would've had a terrible time in Slytherin, both might have been able to convince the Hat to put them into Ravenclaw if they had coordinated it. Of course the tradition of not letting the first years know how the sorting works might have prevented that.
