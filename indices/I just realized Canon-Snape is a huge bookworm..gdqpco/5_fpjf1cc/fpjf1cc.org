His bookworm persona made him very relatable to me. In his memories in OotP you see him writing more than the others, which I automatically connected to Hermione who did the same. This might be the reason, why I enjoy FF that come up with a Hermione/Snape mentorship. While Canon Snape surely prefered to spend his time in solitude, I like the image of two likeminded people, striving for knowledge together. Prof. Snape was an amazing wizard, creating own spells, revising his textbook. Surely he did some "light" background reading in order to accomplish this. James or Sirius said, he knew more curses in first year than anybody in 7th year. Given the fact that he is halfblood and neglected by his parents, books would need to be the ones that taught him.
