In "Camerado" by Millie Joan Hermione takes Occlumency lessons from Snape because she wants to try teach Harry. There's one in which he taught her critical thinking above all but I forgot the title. Then there's "Bound to Him" by georgesgurl117, which I would not recommend easily, as a crucial plot point is rape. But Snape teaches Hermione combative and defensive skills as they are bound to fight together. A very harmless but lovely one is "Pet Project" by Caeria, though the focus is not on Snape teaching Hermione, they end up developing an original solution in how to kill Voldemort. Most stories I recall containing mentoring start post-war but I personally prefer the ones that build up to save Snape. Camerado is extremely compatible with all the books and still manages to twist it, telling the story Harry just didn't witness.
