the Phoenix trilogy of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1760628/grangerous]] is interesting, because its premise is that it's canon-compliant (i.e. Hermione is mentored by Snape in HBP and DH and never tells anyone). I've never read the third part which is post-DH because it isn't finished however it's only missing the epilogue (and it's been so for 7 years)
