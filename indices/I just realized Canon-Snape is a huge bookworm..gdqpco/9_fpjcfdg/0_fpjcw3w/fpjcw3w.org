Ah, not at all. The HNQ was talking about why Snape bothered with exam if he's just going to become the wizard equivalent of bomb-maker and perhaps medic. Reading the answer instead put the "this guy got a wall of books!" front and center in my mind. That was never my impression of Snape before. Tragic, sure, asshole, that too, yeah yeah smart to be extremely good at potion and invent several spells without dying at young age. But, books! Everyone in the canon seems to joke about Hermione being a bookworm (despite having a House full of nerds and their Headmaster displaying exquisite collection in his office), but this is a guy who fill his simple home with books.
