Oceania is scientifically and technologically stagnant in most respects, and great at rationalizing away inconvenient truths. I doubt it uncovers magic, and if it did, it'll just choose to forget it.

Probably the Wizards become more insular and xenophobic. They may not want to take Muggle-born children, as those children will already have been heavily-indoctrinated. Any children with magical ability will probably either be ignored and left to become possible Obscurials, kidnapped and likely mindwiped, or left with their families and mind-wiped.
