There's another story that I can't seem to find right now that Had Harry confront Snape in the great hall. Tell how Snape owes him a life debt, then calls on magic to judge Snape on whether he violated the life debt and should lose his magic and/or his life. Magic judges Snape and he ends up on the floor bleeding and dead. Dumbledore is of course, disappointed in Harry
