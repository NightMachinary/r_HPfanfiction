Consequence for Cause by cambangst

"Dumbledore!"

The old man finally paused in response to Snape's outburst. "How much longer do we continue to play this ridiculous game?" Snape stomped across the room and stopped in front of Dumbledore's desk. "Potter and I loathe one another. That is never going to change. If the boy must be educated, why not set the task to Lupin or Moody? Someone he does not despise."

Something in the room changed. A palpable energy charged the air, like the hum of electricity before a lightning strike. In spite of his anger, Snape took half a step back.

"Why do you suppose he hates you so, Severus?" Dumbledore's voice was soft. Dangerous. Like the whisper of an assassin's blade.

Snape threw up his arms in frustration. "We both know very well why he's been made to hate me. The Dark Lord can never suspect the truth, otherwise your plans would be ruined. This is the role you've cast for me, Dumbledore."

The old man's expression remained impassive. "What you're describing, Severus, is a consequence, not a cause. You're more than clever enough to understand the difference. Why does Potter hate you?"

Snape spun around like a petulant youngster, no longer able to stomach the hard blue eyes that saw through him. "He blames me for the death of his parents."

"Shouldn't he?"

The younger man turned back to face the Headmaster, eyes blazing with anger. "That was your failing, Dumbledore. Not mine, yours!" His voice rose to a shout. "I gave you everything. Told you everything. Swore my life to you! On one condition." He pounded his fist against the great, wooden desk. "One condition only! That you would keep them safe!"

Dumbledore continued to regard him with a cold, steely calm. "Keep her safe," he quietly corrected. "You asked me to keep her safe. And once again, you confuse consequence for cause. Why did she require my protection? What compelled you to swear your life to me?" Snape's eyes fell to the floor. After several moments of painful silence, the Headmaster continued. "There's something I want you to know, Severus. I never told her how the Dark Lord came to know of the prophecy." The former Potions Master's head snapped back up, genuine shock filling his normally stony face. "I thought she'd already suffered more than enough anguish on your account."

The old man rose to his feet. His blue eyes burned with barely contained fury. "Lily Potter never knew that the boy she befriended as a little girl was the one who betrayed her to the Dark Lord." Snape fell back several steps, looking stricken, until he bumped into an overstuffed armchair and barely caught himself before he crashed to the floor. "Lily Potter died without knowing that boy tried to sacrifice her family to the Dark Lord in return for her life." Dumbledore slowly made his way around the desk. The air around him crackled with magic. "And Lily Potter rests peacefully without knowing how shamefully that boy has treated her son."

The Headmaster came to a stop in front of Snape, staring down at him with an expression of pure disgust. "Lily Potter will never have to carry those burdens. But you know how she would have felt about those things, Severus. How she would have felt about you. You know it every time you see her eyes, filled with hatred, on the face of her son. And so long as I'm alive, that is a burden you will never escape." He towered over Snape's cowering form for a few moments longer, eyes boring into the younger man, before turning away to face the window. "You have much to do tomorrow. Leave me. Go back to your dungeons. Sleep, if you're able."

Neither man spoke another word as Severus Snape hurried out of the Headmaster's office.
