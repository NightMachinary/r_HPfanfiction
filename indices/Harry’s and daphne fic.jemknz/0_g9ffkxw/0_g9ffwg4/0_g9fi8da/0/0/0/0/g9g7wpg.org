Yes. And plenty of people have worked through them their entire life without looking to others to do everything for them. But not a single thing you've said has come off as anything other than an excuse.

It's not life and death or rocket science. If you want to see certain ideas in a fic, write it. It doesn't have to be good. It's a learning experience. You might even find a hobby you enjoy.
