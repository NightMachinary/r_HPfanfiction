In breath of the inferno by primordial vortex Harry is a dragon animagus but more of a Tolkien dragon like Smaug, and is much bigger than the regular HP dragons

Sadly the fic is kind dead and the author has stated they lost interest in HP FanFiction to the point of only considering Harry going off worlding with different crossovers.
