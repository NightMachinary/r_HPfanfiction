Fair point.

It's not much of a defense, but I had to change the ending to comply with the site guidelines (I wrote the story for a contest there).

I agree about the underwhelming ending. Better (and more poetic) would have been for Harry to be prevented from entering the portal at the end. And to have twisted the knife in the last section a bit more.
