  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path.*time travel*

  Hermione's parents were killed by Death Eaters just before the fall of Voldemort and she was adopted by Severus Snape as part of his reparations to the post-war Wizarding World. Hermione grows up with a distant father, a library full of Dark magic, and the knowledge that Voldemort has taken away her one chance for a happy, loving family. With a father who is the Head of Slytherin House, a Muggle-born being sorted into it isn't all that surprising - even if nobody knows she is one.However, her plans to steal the next generation of Voldemort's supporters, usurp him, and take his throne as the Darkest Lady of the century, might be a little surprising. But only a little.The fact that Dumbledore doesn't bother to stop her is possibly the most surprising of all.

  Hermione has lost herself. Her identity, her memory is now a complete blank, even down to her being a witch. She's a girl on the run. But she doesn't know what she's running from. She doesn't even know her own name.(Story featured on the now-closed Granger Enchanted site)

  The true time-turner was slammed savagely into Hermione's throat. It shattered against her neck, bits of glass and gold piercing into her skin. The last thing she saw before blackness consumed her was a plume of metallic dust and vitreous fragments, tiny prisms dancing behind her eyelids. (In which Hermione accidentally ends up in 1950, pitted against an ascending Dark Lord in his prime, caught in the entanglement of pureblood politics, dark magic, and Tom Riddle's interest)
