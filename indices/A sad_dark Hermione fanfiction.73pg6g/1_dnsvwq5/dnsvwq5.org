Enough with H/TR or H/LV, how about something just as horrible, but in a different way:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9561455/1/Spectrum][Spectrum]], linkffn(9561455)

I actually think the ending to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971), is bloody depressing too. Or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12503328/1/The-Day-the-Magic-Died][The Day the Magic Died]], linkffn(12503328).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), a HP/SG1/SW crossover by Darth Marrs, is freaking dark with genocides occurring every 5 chapters, and it seems to be heading to an end of Arthurian proportion.
