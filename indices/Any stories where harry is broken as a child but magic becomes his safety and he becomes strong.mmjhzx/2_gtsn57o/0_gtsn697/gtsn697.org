  After a few too many hard knocks in early childhood, magic has turned Harry into a tough, twisted, somewhat impaired and very ugly version of himself with a severe speech defect.Magic is also going to help him learn how to kick everybody's backside.This is the tale of a Harry who has learned the hard way that adults are fallible and that he will have to rely only on himself, and his long, slow journey to a very different life than the one Dumbledore had in store for him. The lessons he learns are not the ones most adults wanted to teach him and the family he ends up with is not the one Dumbledore set him with.This story is written in a very sparse style and chapters are very short. The longest chapter is still less than one thousand, five hundred words long and the beginning chapters tend towards five hundred words.
