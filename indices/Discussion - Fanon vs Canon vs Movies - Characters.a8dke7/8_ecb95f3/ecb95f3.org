Never really fancied Canon and Movie Snape but still, he was an intriguing character. On the other hand, I cannot begin to describe my hatred for Fanon Snape. The man isn't a selfless hero.

As for Draco, fanon Draco is a bit of a mixed bag. A great lover in some fics, the same spineless coward in others. Too bad Draco's redemption in the books was basically unexplored.

Surprised no one has brought up Harry yet. Both canon and movie Harry had some serious British sass. But in fanon, that sass is missing in 90% of the fics. Instead, writers just love to portray him as the edgy, angsty teen from OoTP. Still, I love fanon disillusioned-with-the-world Harry. Unfortunately, the movies and canon made him so magnanimous to the extent that he almost seems saintly.
