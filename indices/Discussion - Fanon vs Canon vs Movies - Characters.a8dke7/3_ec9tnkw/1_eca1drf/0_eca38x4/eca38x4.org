Not necessarily. One of the biggest themes of the Series is Choice. Characters making different choices will sometimes have very different lives down the road, and exploring these alternate scenarios is exactly the purpose of fanfictions.

For example, if young Severus met some obnoxious Pureblood Slytherins on the train first, he might decide to follow Lily into Gryffindor, for he certainly had enough bravery.

Or if Merope had decided not to dope Tom Sr, Tom Jr or Voldemort would have not been born. The lack of Voldemort would have meant a drastically different Wizarding Britain. Some well known villains in the Series such as Barty Jr and Bellatrix might not have become bad at all. I like "Delenda Est" exactly because this fic doesn't try to whitewash Bellatrix at all. She remains a deeply flawed person, but instead of following a sadistic genocidal maniac all the way down the rabbit hole, she followed Harry and could put her virtues to good use.

The possibilities are pretty much endless.
