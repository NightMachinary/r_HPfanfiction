Thanks Inq. [[/u/Fredrik1994][u/Fredrik1994]], I don't have a huge amount of time at the moment so I'll just go over the highlights of my opinion!

Firstly, I think both myself and [[/u/goodlife23][u/goodlife23]] agree that Ginny's character could have been better developed in the books, but if you look carefully there is a character arc there and there is a strong personality. We see her go from an insecure, stereotypical tween with grand ideas of romance to someone with resilience, the ability to stand up to Harry when he's being dumb, a good sense of humour, and assertiveness over her own sexuality.

What we get in the movies is someone incredibly passive and sappy. Many of the lines are just cringey, borderline subservient. There's a really wonderful piece of fanart on Tumblr that floats around pointing out that movie Ginny says "don't you trust me?" And gently feeds Harry a mince pie. In the books she probably would have shoved it in his face as a joke. She's more alike to Ron and the twins and that's why Harry likes her. As for tying the shoelace scene - ugh. Cringe.

Oddly enough, the only bit that felt natural in the films was the brief, desperate kiss they share at the battle of hogwarts. This was suggested by Dan and Bonnie and im really glad they did. But in general she just seems to be a bland girlfriend character with no chemistry. Think about how they get together in the books - a mutal moment of spontaniety surrounded by other people in a jubilient atmosphere. Compared to the film - a secretive, brief kiss at a moment of emotional distress with an overly sophisticated line. It's meant to be more romantic but it just comes across as cheesy.
