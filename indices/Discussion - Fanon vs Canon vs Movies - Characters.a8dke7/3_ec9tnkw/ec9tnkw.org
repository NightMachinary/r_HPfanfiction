According to [[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3vWAgfzMRwCcFaGFYPtok8TLPMcH0GpbWauvWtlNOg5vWwQ/viewanalytics][our latest survey]], most people here (~70%) do not consider Movies canon. I belong to this camp. For me, it's another form of fanfiction written by the screenwriter Steve Kloves, who pushed hard for a Harry/Hermione outcome, bashed Ron and Ginny, and glorified Hermione, Draco, and Snape.

Movie depictions of characters have no influence on my perception about Book characters. Similarly, fanon depictions of characters don't either, even though I may like or hate them in particular settings.

For examples:

- I hate Petunia Dursley and think she deserved at least a few years in prison for her child abuse, but the Petunia Evans in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]] is great.
- I hate Bellatrix Lestrange and think she deserved a lot worse than in canon, but the Bellatrix Black in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] is a fun character.
- I love Book Ron, but Movie Ron is a stupid jerk Hermione should never get together with.
