  Sometimes it's a bit deluded since Ginny's fans seem to think that that's actually in the books somewhere, but as a H/Hr shipper I'm not bothered by a bit of delusion.

Oh no, he said the evil thing! /Burn the heretic!/

I mean, I'm the last person to disagree that Ginny wasn't around much during the books, but the scenes she does show up in and the things we learn about her second hand are more than enough to leave a good impression of what kind of person she is.

(Also HBP clearly showed that Ginny is great for Harry and if anything is delusional it's the idea that Harry and Hermione with their canon personalities, as presented by the books, could actually be in a stable and happy relationship together for an extended period of time) :P
