  Also HBP clearly showed that Ginny is great for Harry

I respectfully disagree. HBP has one of the dumbest Ginny quotes of all time, fundamentally misunderstanding the nature of Harry's character [and most of the rest is Harry just indulging in a teenage snogging romance that's uncomplicated with a girl that doesn't cry and allows him to unwind]:

  “But you've been too busy saving the Wizarding world,” said Ginny, half laughing. “Well ... I can't say I'm surprised. I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldn't be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort. Maybe that's why I like you so much.”
#+end_quote

Every single thing here is wrong. It shows that they probably wouldn't do well together because she can't see through the Boy-Who-Lived and just sees him for his "saving people thing".. it also shows how her characterization is inconsistent, as the kind of character we imagine (and are told) Ginny to be wouldn't say things like "Yeah you have to do your duty and I as your girlfriend will demurely wait for you until you come back, gallant hero." Ginny is supposed to be the opposite of that.

I agree with you that we clearly understand what Ginny is supposed to be, but it is mostly done through telling (as you wrote "we learn about her second hand") instead of showing, which is why I claim she lacks characterization. I have similar feelings about Molly (just much more unfavourably): We clearly understand and are told (mostly through Harry's lens) that she's supposed to be some kind of surrogate mom for Harry, her actions just don't really back that up when evaluated from a grown-up standpoint instead of an abused kid starved for love and affection.
