I think you're misunderstanding that line.

When Ginny says that Harry wouldn't be happy unless he was hunting Voldemort she doesn't mean that Harry takes joy in fighting him, but rather that he couldn't sit back and happily enjoy leisure life with his girlfriend knowing that Voldemort is still out there killing people.

As for Ginny staying back while Harry is hunting Horcruxes, I agree that that's kind of against how she's characterized, but it's hardly the only time JKR was staining my suspension of disbelief a bit in her effort to make sure the final book would be a camping adventure focused exclusively on the trio.

  and most of the rest is Harry just indulging in a teenage snogging romance that's uncomplicated with a girl that doesn't cry and allows him to unwind

This makes me wonder a bit what kind things you'd want out of a relationship that Harry and Ginny don't have. I mean, they had a similar sense of humor way before being in a relationship, have an easy time making the other smile just by being around each other, like to do the same things for fun, can talk to each other about important things in a way that actually helps (see their conversation in OotP), and are physically attracted to each other. That's just about as perfect a match as you can get.
