  Yes, but Ginny doesn't know that. Harry never told anyone except Ron and Hermione about the prophecy, so Ginny has no way of knowing that Harry personally has to kill Voldemort and as far as she is concerned the only reason he personally involves himself in the war effort is because of his sense of obligation.

Okay, sure. I can agree to that. IMHO Harry shouldn't be in a relationship with someone who's more dense than Crabbe and Goyle combined.

I feel like you have even less respect for Ginny than I have if you think she's that stupid. And they certainly don't "understand each other perfectly" (as the book says) if any of your interpretation is true. You are just arguing that Ginny misunderstands Harry in a different way than I do.

  or because they don't have enough meaningful conversations anymore but rather because once the butterflies are gone they slowly stop enjoying each other's day to day company until being around each other is more of a chore than something they enjoy.

Right, and Ginny&Harry only have butterflies and snogging. When they are gone, those fantastic conversations about nothing will suddenly be really about nothing and incredibly dull.

  That's funny considering that Ginny was pretty much the only one who could reliably cheer Harry up during his sixth year.

Any pair of tits would have cheered Harry up. He was escaping from the realities of his fate. He wants to be normal, he wants to have a girlfriend and snog.

  Excuse me but what? Wasn't it Harry who fell in love with Ginny without any real goading from her and then kissed her in the middle of the common room? How exactly does that show he's unassertive?
#+end_quote

No... you misunderstand. Harry doesn't have to do anything with Ginny. She's already head over heels for him. She's a free pass. That's why she's perfect. What does he do when there's a problem (cho cries, Voldemort needs to be killed)? Break up.

As you so wisely stated, it's not going to be butterflies in the stomach all the time and as soon as that happens Harry is going to break up, because he thinks something is wrong with the relationship. He's not in a serious relationship and I doubt his hormonal highschool crush will be the one to teach him emotional maturity.
