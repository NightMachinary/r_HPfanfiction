  Any pair of tits would have cheered Harry up. He was escaping from the realities of his fate. He wants to be normal, he wants to have a girlfriend and snog.

You should check out [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/398ckt/harry_and_ginnys_shared_sense_of_humor/][this]] thread about Harry's and Ginny's humorous interactions throughout the books. Note that these scenes start off way before Harry was even remotely interested in Ginny's tits.

He also never has moments like this with Hermione despite interacting with her so incredibly more often than with Ginny.

  Right, and Ginny&Harry only have butterflies and snogging. When they are gone, those fantastic conversations about nothing will suddenly be really about nothing and incredibly dull.

Now you're just making assumptions. Harry's and Ginny's shared sense of humor and shared biggest hobby already give them plenty to talk about and you can't know they won't have riveting intelligent conversations if they want to.

Meanwhile, we actually do know that Harry has plenty of riveting intelligent conversations with Hermione, but we also know that Harry doesn't really enjoy those without Ron around.

  No... you misunderstand. Harry doesn't have to do anything with Ginny. She's already head over heels for him. She's a free pass. That's why she's perfect. What does he do when there's a problem (cho cries, Voldemort needs to be killed)? Break up.
#+end_quote

Just because Ginny already liked him doesn't mean she's a bad match. And it's hardly an issue with Ginny in particular that he broke up with her to hunt for Horcruxes. He would have done that with literally anyone. Heck, he even tried to get rid of Ron and Hermione multiple times when he felt they would be in too much danger.

  I feel like you have even less respect for Ginny then I have if you think she's that stupid. And they certainly don't "understand each other perfectly" (as the book says) if any of your interpretation is true. You are just arguing that Ginny misunderstands Harry in a different way than I do.

I think you're taking too much of your own perspective as a reader into acount here. For us as the audience it's easy to see that Harry is the chosen one who will ultimately defeat Voldemort. It was completely obvious from the very first book.

However, for his friends in universe he's just some kid who got lucky as a baby, and whom Voldemort is now obsessed with for that reason. He's pretty decent at Dada, true, but he's not the kind of person you'd normally look for to fight a civil war against a madman who is far better at magic than he is, unless you either know the prophecy, or are familiar with common story tropes.
