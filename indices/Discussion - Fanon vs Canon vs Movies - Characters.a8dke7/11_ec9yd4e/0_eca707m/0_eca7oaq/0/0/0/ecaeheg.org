  If you go with this explanation Ginny is just really shallow and frankly stupid, because why the fuck would she muse about having a romantic getaway with Harry in the current state of war?! This doesn't even scratch the surface of the issue since there's an actual prophecy that flat-out says that it cannot happen ("neither can live while the other survives""
#+end_quote

Yes, but /Ginny doesn't know that/. Harry never told anyone except Ron and Hermione about the prophecy, so Ginny has no way of knowing that Harry personally has to kill Voldemort and as far as she is concerned the only reason he personally involves himself in the war effort is because of his sense of obligation.

  This meta analysis doesn't help to reconcile those characters though. It's about what's in the text, not what JKR envisioned and failed to realize.
#+end_quote

If you don't do at least a little bit of meta analysis then pretty much all adults in Harry Potter are incompetent negligent idiots. With JKR you sometimes just have to accept that she cares more about plot and creativity than about keeping everything 100% logically consistent.

  Harry and Hermione probably had about 50.
#+end_quote

Yeah, and they went oh so well, didn't they? Remind me again of how well Hermione managed to comfort Harry when Cedric died? Or Sirius?

Listen, the reason why most relationships fail is not because they stop being in love, or because they stop being attracted to each other, or because they don't have enough meaningful conversations anymore but rather because once the butterflies are gone they slowly stop enjoying each other's day to day company until being around each other is more of a chore than something they enjoy.

Which is precisely why Harry/Hermione would probably be a horrible idea. Pretty much every time in canon the two of them are alone with each other without Ron to lighten things up they both slowly start withdrawing and grow depressed if not downright abrasive towards each other. Why would they be any different in a relationship than at any of the times they were together without Ron in canon?

  She'd be completely lost with war veteran hero who doesn't know what to do with his life now
#+end_quote

That's funny considering that Ginny was pretty much the only one who could reliably cheer Harry up during his sixth year.

  Harry becoming an Auror just because that's what he's used to be doing is really fucking sad, really.
#+end_quote

I'm not too sure about that one either. I personally much prefer the idea of Harry ending up as a teacher. That being said quite a few real life veterans end up as cops and aren't necessarily unhappy with it so who knows?

  being stuck in a teenage crush relationship for life because you never learned to assert yourself in relationships
#+end_quote

Excuse me but what? Wasn't it Harry who fell in love with Ginny without any real goading from her and then kissed her in the middle of the common room? How exactly does that show he's unassertive?
