  When Ginny says that Harry wouldn't be happy unless he was hunting Voldemort she doesn't mean that Harry takes joy in fighting him, but rather that he couldn't sit back and happily enjoy leisure life with his girlfriend knowing that Voldemort is still out there killing people.

Sure, that's the go-to excuse for that line... but it's the dumbest way to say this. There's no "leisure life with his girlfriend" on the horizon if Harry doesn't go after Voldemort. Not because he wouldn't be "happy" in that scenario, but because it wouldn't be. I have no idea why someone would say it that way, unless they really miss the point of why he's breaking up and going after Voldemort. If you go with your explanation Ginny is just really shallow and frankly stupid, because why the fuck would she muse about having a romantic getaway with Harry in the current state of war?! This doesn't even scratch the surface of the issue since there's an actual prophecy that flat-out says that it cannot happen ("neither can live while the other survives")

  but it's hardly the only time JKR was staining my suspension of disbelief a bit in her effort to make sure the final book would be a camping adventure focused exclusively on the trio.

Sure, I understand the reasons. I understand why Dumbledore accidentally became a villain (because JKR wanted a downtrodden hero) or why Ron had to be a dumbass (dramatic tension). This meta analysis doesn't help to reconcile those characters though. It's about what's in the text, not what JKR envisioned and failed to realize.

  can talk to each other about important things in a way that actually helps (see their conversation in OotP

name about 5 more conversations like this and I'll concede your point. Harry and Hermione probably had about 50.

Ginny only relates to Harry as prophecy-boy or her hot teenage crush. She'd be completely lost with war veteran hero who doesn't know what to do with his life now (Harry becoming an Auror just because that's what he's used to be doing is really fucking sad, really. Everything after HBP is a huge fucking tragedy, which is why in literary sense he should have died... not that I would have enjoyed that... seeing everyone around you die and suffer, being stuck in a teenage crush relationship for life because you never learned to assert yourself in relationships, your adoptive family almost exclusively relates to you through your prophetic existence, but it's barely their fault because you can't and aren't allowed to make an identity for yourself beyond that, constantly tip-toeing around your best friend, because this abused orphaned boy has money, railroaded towards your destiny, a pig led to slaughter and then you survive by a total fluke. poor kid. he'd be so messed up if he were real). But I guess because they both have been possessed by Voldemort once they can totally relate.
