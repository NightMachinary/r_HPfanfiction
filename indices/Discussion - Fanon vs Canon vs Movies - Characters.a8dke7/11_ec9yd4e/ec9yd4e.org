  did you hate in Canon and now love because of Fan fics
#+end_quote

Do you mean this in a "fanon changed my mind about characters" way? If that is true, then zero. Possibly it made me hate Dumbledore a bit more, because some fics either accidentally (through Dumbledore apologia) or on purpose (through bashing) point out how truly awful he is.

If you mean whether I like some fanon incarnations of characters over their canon variants? Definitely, but it really depends. The only exception may be Snape, who's a very complex and interesting character in canon and is often turned into a very one dimensional caricature in fanon; or even worse he's completely disgusting, grooming a schoolgirl or -boy (Snarry).

Draco and Ron are usually better than in canon. Most people who love them and write about them at least acknowledge some of their issues and make an effort to have the characters overcome them, but I usually just prefer them to be absent from the fic (which is still an improvement over canon). Fanon Ron who never befriended Harry, aimlessly bumbling through school is almost my favorite character. It's such a breath of fresh air.

Hmm... who else comes to mind that's improved in fanon? Definitely Ginny. She's almost a non-character in canon and almost every story with her in a prominent role I've read made some effort to characterize her. Sometimes it's a bit deluded since Ginny's fans seem to think that that's actually in the books somewhere, but as a H/Hr shipper I'm not bothered by a bit of delusion.

I kinda hate fanon!Harry sometimes, especially when authors try way too hard to fix him, without giving him any proper character development in that direction. These are usually Harrys who feel very self-inserty, aka a thinly veiled attempt of an author to roleplay "what would I do as Harry? (everything correctly of course!)". [Meaning he's always retroactively correct through the power of authorial fiat.] canon!Harry on the other hand is a pretty cool dude, who makes gut decisions that he sometimes regrets and doesn't know when it might be better to just shut up. fanon!Harry is often just bland and one-dimensional.

  I loved him when he was played by Richard Harris
#+end_quote

Richard Harris did a wonderful performance of a kind and wise old grandpa Wizard. Which is why he was completely inappropriate for the role and would have been particularly terrible for the later books. I guess Richard Harris sorta works for a Dumbledore in a vacuum, when only looking at his characterization in Book 1 & 2 (as if he's not the same man who willingly placed Harry in an abusive home and later set Harry up to die). For Dumbledore as a whole Michael Gambon is much closer to how I'd imagine him.

Not sure if any of this was what you wanted to hear.
