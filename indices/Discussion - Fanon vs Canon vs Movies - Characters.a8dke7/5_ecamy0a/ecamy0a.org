I tend to prefer canon, and lean towards canon-compliant fics. I tend to prefer shorter fics that focus on "missing moments." I also like different perspective fics--a good example is /Not From Others,/ which is the best Ginny-Deathly Hallows fic of the lot.

As a result, I don't love any characters that I hated in canon, beyond a few special examples--/Stages of Hope/ gives a terrific portrayal of Severus Snape if he never fell to the Death Eaters, but I tend to dislike most Fanon interpretations of Snape.

So for me, it's not so much "what do I prefer" from fanfic or the movies, but what am I willing to include for the books from the fanfics and movies.

*Harry Potter*

Where to begin? Fanon gets a lot wrong.

Harry is not one who wallows in angst.

He confronts authority when he believes it needs to be confronted, and he does not let personal affection get in the way of calling someone out, be they an authority figure or not.

*Ron Weasley*

Ron is not treated fairly in the movies. At all. Shame on Steve Kloves for what he did. Ditto a good chunk of Fanon.

That said, I do like it when Ron is portrayed as more willing to stand up to authority on Harry's behalf or even for his own sake. We see glimpses of this in canon, but it's rarely elaborated on.

*Ginny Weasley*

Not unlike her brother, Ginny didn't get much of a fair shake in the films. She's missing a lot of spark.

Incidentally, Ginny and Ron's entire canonical dynamic is all but absent in the films, but that's a story for another day.

So for me, my interpretation of Ginny is how it is in canon. I appreciate that fanon tried to add substance to her that the movies lacked, but there's a certain...element that was missed I think. Fanon Ginny is popular and sporty, but she doesn't usually have the nerve to stand up for someone who won't stand up for themselves.

*Luna Lovegood.*

For a supporting character, I'm surprised how invested in Luna I end up being.

Of all the deviations from the books, the movies treated Luna relatively softly. Other than minor physical differences--her hair color and small stature, I don't have much of a problem with Movie!Luna.

I disregard most elements of Sage!Luna (/Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection/ is an exception, as Luna barely understands the visions she gets). This was never a thing in canon. Fanon also depicts her as a victim of far harsher bullying than canon implies--and I also reject much of it.

So for me, Luna's mostly like she is in the books, though she keeps a barefoot habit whenever she can--it's a somewhat unique quirk in the Harry Potter universe, and it helps set Luna apart.
