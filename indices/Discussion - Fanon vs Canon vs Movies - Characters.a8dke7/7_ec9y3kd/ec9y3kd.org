Tonks. When I first read the books and saw the movies, she was just one of the background order members. And any interest I had into her character went away with the Lupin romance, or more accurately that she took him back after his runner and her general insistence to fight for the relationship after Lupin shot her down a few times.

I read a few fanfics where she was almost a Mary Sue, so I went back to the books and looked closer at the sections where she made an appearance. And I fell in love with her character in OotP. Until Hermione turns 18, she is the only badass woman who makes an onscreen appearance (Lily sadly does not). Everyone is losing their mind about Voldemort, doom and gloom everywhere, and in between is Tonks, doing silly faces and keeping her spirits high.

Hence why I consider HBP/DH a character assassination and really dislike the Lupin romance for what it did to her character. And Rowling's admission about her pining after her ex husband influencing the last book is a small mercy there.
