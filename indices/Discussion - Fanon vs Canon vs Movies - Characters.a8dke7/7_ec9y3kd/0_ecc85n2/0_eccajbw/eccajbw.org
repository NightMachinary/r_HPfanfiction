Yes, but I have no sympathy for Lupin because he fathered a child without considering the consequences. If not for a seventeen year old virgin, his marriage would have been over three months in. Hell, I really doubt that it would have lasted since Lupin destroyed any trust his wife has had by running away.

And the "he was protecting her" excuse doesn't work because in that case, he wouldn't have married her in the first place. Or, at the very least, didn't forgo the condom.
