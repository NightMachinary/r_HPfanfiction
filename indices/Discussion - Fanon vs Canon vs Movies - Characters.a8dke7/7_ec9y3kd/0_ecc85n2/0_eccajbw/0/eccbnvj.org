I'm not sure condoms are a thing in the wizarding world and I'm quite sure he just panicked, his old and deep rooted fear of finally having destroyed somebody's life by forgetting for a while, that he had no right to get married or have children getting the better of him again. Then again he's my favourite character and I'm sure he is a very different person in your eyes. I'm actually very happy with the way things turned out because I suspect that the day Teddy was born was the only time he had been truly beside himself with happiness in his whole life and Nymphadora was the only person who had ever truly loved him aside from his parents. Personally I think he deserved it.
