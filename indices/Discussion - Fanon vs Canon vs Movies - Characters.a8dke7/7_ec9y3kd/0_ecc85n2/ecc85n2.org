I think that's partly because (imo, of course) Rowling did not write romance very well. I'm sure there is a way their relationship could have been made more sympathetic to us if somebody ever tried. Why shouldn't she be persistent in love? And Remus was pushing her away because he didn't love her, but because he believed that he was too old, poor, and stigmatized and would ruin the lives of whoever came too close to him. All truth in his eyes as he had never experienced anything to the contrary in this short life.
