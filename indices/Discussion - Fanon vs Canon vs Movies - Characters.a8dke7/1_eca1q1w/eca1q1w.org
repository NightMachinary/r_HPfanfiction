My favourite character in the books is Sirius, though he's not very well developed; but there is still an enticing hint of darkness about him that the films (after PoA ) seem to skip over. I think this must be down to the direction, as I'm sure Gary Oldman was more than capable of doing a better job of it.

Fanon is all over the place, making him everything from a playboy Lothario to a needy anorexic, and everything in between.
