  Fanon is all over the place, making him everything from a playboy Lothario to a needy anorexic, and everything in between.

Yeah that'd be my observation too. canon!Sirius is interesting with a hint (or multiple hints) of depth and 'more', while fanon has a lot of 'more', it's just an incredibly mixed bag, rarely really getting to the depth part of it. Though the typical protective Sirius, trying to be somewhat of a father figure and a connection to Harry's parents while making up for lost times usually works okay.
