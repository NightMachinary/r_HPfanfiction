Hermione. Oh my god I hate fanon!Hermione. Canon Hermione can get on my nerves at times, but overall I loved her reading the book and identified with her a lot growing up. Fanon and Movie Hermione have almost killed that love at this point. It has stripped her of all her flaws, often to the detriment of Ron, Harry, and sometimes even Dumbledore, and made her almost unbearable. I literally sometimes have to remind myself why I liked Hermione in the first place, because I associate her character with such negativity now.
