Yes this!

​

I started to dislike her around the third movie and it started to fester from there. She was turning into such a bossy Mary Sue. She never did anything wrong and when she did it wasn't her fault. Whenever something bad happened to her it wasn't her fault (almost always Ron's) and in the end that person would apologise or be shown to be wrong.

​

Then there was the Emma Watson portrayal. She was so shrill and sounded as if she was about to cry most of the time. She was so awkward and had a 'Holier than thou' air about her. I always saw Book Hermione as a nerdy girl who wanted to be helpful, but ended up sounding condescending by accident. Move Hermione was just an asshole a lot of the time.

​

Book Hermione was awesome. She was smart, but far from perfect. I especially loved the House elf rights movement. She was misguided, uninformed, but had good intentions. She didn't really win in the end, because that was a lost battle from start, but she got a compromise (I might not be remembering this part correctly).
