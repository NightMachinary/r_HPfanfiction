  (Honestly even the '10 dark years' line would've been much better accepted if it was said by Harris - he would seem genuinely remorseful)

It's not remorse though. It's only remorse if you wouldn't do it again. Dumbledore is just kinda bummed, like the Mafia boss who has to shoot one of his minions because he heard too much. "What a shame!" "Well, you could stop being a mafia boss and go to prison, I'd rather prefer not to be shot?" "Nah!" *BANG*

I agree though that Harris would have pulled off the emotional manipulation better, because he would have seemed more genuine.
