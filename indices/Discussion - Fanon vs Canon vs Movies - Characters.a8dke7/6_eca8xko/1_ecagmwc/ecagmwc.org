  Canon Dumbledore: a hyper-intelligent, decent person, who, when confronted with an impossible situation made an extremely difficult choice to save as many lives as possible.
#+end_quote

Disagree on the decent person part, as well as the making difficult decisions part.

As a young adult, he was conceited, and resented the fact that his ailing sister prevented him from realising his brilliance. His neglects his duty as the man of the house and goes off to discuss daydreams with Grindelwald. In the wonky hallucination scene, he says he doesn't know if he cast the spell that killed his sister - which means that he did cast potentially lethal spells, in a fight with his brother and best friend. Oh yes, very decent indeed.

As a professor at Hogwarts, he sees the rise of Tom Riddle from the very beginning, and exacerbates Tom's attitudes towards the world around him. Because, you know, when you find that a 10 year old is a kleptomaniac and a burgeoning psychopath, burning his cupboard down is absolutely the best thing that can be done.

He suspects Tom Riddle as the mastermind behind the Chamber of Secrets, but doesn't do much - other than maybe share vague suspicions with other teachers. I'm not even going to suggest that he ought to have stunned, bound and interrogated Tom on a whim - but he could have trailed Tom under disillusionment charms to try and confirm if Tom was actually behind the Chamber, observed Tom's behaviour in the Slytherin Common Room as Tom gathered followers and so on. Instead, he just "suspects" Tom.

When Grindelwald was busy on his rampage, Dumbledore kept to Hogwarts like a good little teacher, even though he owed it to himself, his brother and his dead sister to bring Grindelwald to justice. I won't say that he had a duty to the world at large or anything so stupid - if entire nations depend on one man to save them, then they deserve to be destroyed.

As headmaster, he pretty much allows the blood purist ideals to take root, even though he himself is vehemently opposed to those ideals. This is something I cannot understand why he would do, giving second and third chances to students who would normally be expelled otherwise, although that is an assumption - maybe the students who became Death Eaters in their twenties were angels in school. But there were Death Eaters in school - Regulus Black, for one, became a Death Eater when he was 16, although Dumbledore couldn't have known that.

He also puts several students at risk when he decides to take on Remus Lupin as a student, which is mind-boggling. From what Lupin says, we get the impression young werewolves aren't allowed to study at Hogwarts. Why make an exception in Lupin's case? Why endanger so many students? If one student - just one! - was bitten, or mauled through sheer coincidence, that student's life would have been ruined, and Lupin would have been executed.

He places an orphan with relatives who are sure to despise and abuse him. He knows, or at the very least, expects this, as he says in OoTP. He gives Snape the benefit of the doubt when he hears the name of the woman Snape wanked off to, but throws Sirius under the train, even though Sirius joined his vigilante organisation as soon as he graduated. He cast aside a man he taught and fought alongside, at the drop of a hat. But hey, he needed the orphan to grow as unloved as possible, so throw this man to Azkaban, he's outlived his usefulness anyway.

All the shit he pulls during Harry's years at Hogwarts. This is insane. He goes through all of those hoops, like using an incredibly powerful artifact as bait for the most powerful Dark wizard of all time in a school, letting a 12 year old fight the monster of the Chamber, letting a couple of 13 year olds face a large herd of Dementors alone, the shit with the Tournament and the imposter, all of Umbridge, hiring and keeping Snape as a teacher, the attempts to redeem Draco Malfoy - it's insane.

When Harry returns from the graveyard with the names of several Death Eaters, does he move to eliminate them? No he doesn't, even though he knows that those Death Eaters will kill if left to their own devices. He just pretends as though everything is normal, and goes about life as usual. His mindset is, "We're technically at war, but I'm not going to actually kill these lieutenants Voldemort has, because that would make things easier!"

It can be argued that the prophecy was bait for Voldemort to reveal himself, and that the longer the prophecy was kept in place at the Ministry, the more likely Voldemort was to make a mistake. But...why not use a decoy? Why not tell Harry that he can remove the "weapon", take him to the Ministry (whichever way, with or without the Ministry's approval) and place a decoy in place of the actual prophecy?

The Occlumency lessons. Instead of leaving it to Harry, who is a terrible student, to half ass Occlumency, why not impress upon him the importance of those lessons by being present at a few of them?

As for making the difficult decision, he doesn't make any difficult decisions. He leaves the sacrifice to Harry himself. If anything, he's a coward here. Even though he knows that Harry must die, he doesn't have the decency to do the deed himself, like Snape does for with his own life - he leaves that for Voldemort, who might have prolonged Harry's suffering, or made a spectacle out of Harry's death. He even chickens out of telling Harry himself - he delegates that to Snape.

So yeah - Dumbledore isn't decent, and he doesn't make difficult decisions. Ironically, he takes the easy way out, instead of the right way.
