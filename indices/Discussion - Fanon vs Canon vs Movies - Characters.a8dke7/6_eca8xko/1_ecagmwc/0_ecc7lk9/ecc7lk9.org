You mean as a teenager of 18 years old, most brilliant in the history of wizards, he dared dream of a future for himself that contained more than the caring for a disabled younger sister and a younger brother who obviously had a very different character from him? That he dared, furthermore, to fall in love (which I'm quite sure was canonly stated had happened exactly once in his long life) with the only person he had ever met whose intelligence was almost on par with his, dared to be happy for 2 months in more than a hundred years. I'm supposing, of course, that you personally would never dream of (or never dream, for that matter) such disgustingly selfish ideas of having your own life, a career, or even falling in love. Yuck.

Aside from that, I'm surprised that you seem to know what exactly happened at that duel between him, Grindelwald, and his brother, as I was under the impression that no one but Rowling herself knows the details, and that you can safely say that he did something that made him, again, an indecent person.

As I have no experience with psychopathic children myself, aside from the one who I met in the closed ward of a psychiatry who destroyed his adoptive parents' car and then repeatedly raped his younger sister at the age of 14, I wouldn't know what the best measures would have been to impress a young Tom Riddle. I would only like to point out that Dumbledore did not, in fact, burn down any of his belongings.

You seem to have rather strong opinions on what who deserves, let's hope that you never get to decide the fate of any nation, or any community at all, since weakness seems to equal loss of right to exist in your books, and kindness equals stupidity and lunacy. Also, I'm very doubtful that it should be you who decides who Dumbledore owned what to and why. Again, I wouldn't presume to know what exactly happened between him and Grindelwald, or why not that what we might expect have happened in the time did not. That's for the next Fantastic Beast movies to tell.

It also seems to me that you value good teachers very little, I wonder why that is?

Dumbledore does not dog his students' every step, he does not dictate how their parents are supposed to raise them, nor does he expel them at the first chance. He gave Remus the chance to live a semi-normal life for a few years, something he had forever lost to no fault of his own at 4 years of age and certainly helped shaping Remus to the person he later became, which was wise, strong, compassionate and kind, a hero dying fighting the right fight. It might not matter a bit to you, but Remus Lupin's character was established to reflect the discrimination people with certain illnesses are treated with in society, and you are on the side of those who advocate said discrimination. You speak of the Death Eaters as people who should be fought against, but you're promoting suspicion, hatred, isolation, immediate harsh punishment to mistakes even of children, and discrimination of the disabled and diseased. And you call Albus Dumbledore indecent and a lunatic for his compassion, tolerance, belief in the good of men.

As you know fully well, Harry Potter was only forced to stay with Petunia and her family because they were the only blood relatives of Lily, and it was Lily's protection that continues through her blood relatives that protected Harry Potter until the moment he turned 17. Dumbledore certainly did not place him in their care because he thought they were the most suited to care for a wizard child.

You give too much credit to Dumbledore relative to Harry's adventures, he did not orchestrate most of them, least of all Umbridge and the Dementors.

Dumbledore had tried to act according to the law and in cooperation with the Ministry of Magic, killing multiple persons on the account of Harry alone, with no other eyewitnesses and Fudge denouncing the whole story would not only mean war with Voldemort but also war with the Ministry. I fail to see how that would have benefited anybody in any way. And let's not imagine he could have killed all of them at once with just a snap of his fingers. He's Dumbledore, not Thanos. One of them dead, and he'd been on the run from the law earlier than he had been, and the children Hogwarts less protected.

Hindsight is also 20/20.

I'm pretty sure that it was stated that A. Harry had to be the one to decide to sacrifice himself, not be told by Dumbledore to do it, and B. Voldemort had to kill him, and not any random person, not even Dumbledore. I'm not sure he delegated anything to Snape, if anything, he most probably did not expect to die that night on the astronomy tower, and Snape couldn't have told Harry much if he hadn't accidentally been there when he died, either.

So, nothing you said proves that Dumbledore is less than a very strong, intelligent, and most of all, decent person. But it must be fun to bash a person without whom everything since the beginnings of Grindelwald almost 100 years ago would have gone to shit, who worked tirelessly against evil and for the preserving of life and peace, giving his own life in its course, because you would have done it much better.
