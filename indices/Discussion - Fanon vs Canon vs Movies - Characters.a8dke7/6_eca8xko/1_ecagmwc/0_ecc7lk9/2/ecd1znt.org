  I'm supposing, of course, that you personally would never dream of (or never dream, for that matter) such disgustingly selfish ideas of having your own life, a career, or even falling in love
#+end_quote

Some of us don't abandon all duty and responsibility in favour of daydreaming. I've known several people who have done exactly this - put their own dreams and aspirations on hold, and worked like dogs so that their younger brothers and sisters could lead good lives. That is what duty to family sometimes means. I understand that it is the fashion these days, to run away from all responsibility as much as you can, but I've never been much for fashion. Between these things and caring for an ailing family member, I'd choose the latter every single time.

  Aside from that, I'm surprised that you seem to know what exactly happened at that duel between him, Grindelwald, and his brother, as I was under the impression that no one but Rowling herself knows the details, and that you can safely say that he did something that made him, again, an indecent person.
#+end_quote

Either you haven't read what I wrote properly, or you're just arguing for the sake of it. He says in the Flaw in the Plan that he didn't know if he cast the spell which took his sister's life. This does imply that he was casting potentially lethal spells in that fight. It may or may not have been his spell that killed his sister, but the very fact that he was casting potentially lethal spells in a fight against his brother and best friend speaks volumes about a person. And decency is not it.

To a take an analogue, he gets into a fight with his brother and best friend, and all three start throwing knives or pulling guns at each other.

  You seem to have rather strong opinions on what who deserves, let's hope that you never get to decide the fate of any nation, or any community at all, since weakness seems to equal loss of right to exist in your books
#+end_quote

If an entire nation depends upon the actions of one man to save them, then that nation damn well deserves to be destroyed. Such a nation has checked off every factor that makes a nation-state and is either collapsing, or has already collapsed. Communities are not nations.

  Also, I'm very doubtful that it should be you who decides who Dumbledore owned what to and why
#+end_quote

What a useless argument, much like the rest of your comment. Grindelwald was involved in the fight that took his sister's life, and runs off afterwards. Later, he becomes a dark wizard, starting to kill hundreds of witches and wizards, to the point where entire states clamour for Albus to join the fray. There is a moral responsibility there to his deceased sister to bring Grindelwald to justice, since they both share responsibility for her death.

  He gave Remus the chance to live a semi-normal life for a few years, something he had forever lost to no fault of his own at 4 years of age and certainly helped shaping Remus to the person he later became, which was wise, strong, compassionate and kind, a hero dying fighting the right fight. It might not matter a bit to you, but Remus Lupin's character was established to reflect the discrimination people with certain illnesses are treated with in society, and you are on the side of those who advocate said discrimination. You speak of the Death Eaters as people who should be fought against, but you're promoting suspicion, hatred, isolation, immediate harsh punishment to mistakes even of children, and discrimination of the disabled and diseased. And you call Albus Dumbledore indecent and a lunatic for his compassion, tolerance, belief in the good of men.
#+end_quote

You've gone on a complete tangent when you wrote this block of text. I was talking about how Albus exposed the other students to the potential risk of getting bitten or mauled by a werewolf, and you write praises of Lupin's character, which transforms into a jab at me towards the end. At least pretend like you're arguing, you know?

You can say that they took precautions, they were careful and all of that, but accidents happen all the time, even in spite of precautions. It would take just one such accident to ruin the life of another person - it can be a student, or a resident of Hogsmeade. All it would take is for one curious person to go snooping around the Shack when they hear the screams of Lupin transforming, and you'd have a feral werewolf on the loose. Albus' "compassion, tolerance, and belief in the good of men" could have gotten a lot of people killed or mauled for life. That it didn't is sheer luck.

  As you know fully well, Harry Potter was only forced to stay with Petunia and her family because they were the only blood relatives of Lily, and it was Lily's protection that continues through her blood relatives that protected Harry Potter until the moment he turned 17. Dumbledore certainly did not place him in their care because he thought they were the most suited to care for a wizard child.
#+end_quote

He condemns an orphan to ten dark years of abuse, neglect and hate, and he admits to it at the end of OoTP. That is not something a man with any decency does.

If you've ever bothered to read the books, and actually read them, you'd find that the blood protection isn't as useful or foolproof as you're making it seem. A six/seven year old Harry had to climb and hide in a fucking tree, otherwise he'd have been mauled by Marge's dog while the Dursleys and Marge laughed. All of that glorious planning would have been for naught if Harry had slipped and fallen, and broken his neck/had his throat ripped out by Ripper/died of some infection from bite wounds. The great blood protections do nothing against Dementors from attacking Harry and his cousin with impunity. It doesn't prevent Death Eaters from waiting right outside the boundary to ambush Harry.

#+begin_quote
  You give too much credit to Dumbledore relative to Harry's adventures, he did not orchestrate most of them
#+end_quote

Did he, or did he not store the Stone (or a decoy) in a school? Did he, or did he not, house a Cerberus in the same school?

Did he, or did he not, send Fawkes to assist Harry in the Chamber? Fawkes can travel past Hogwarts' protections just fine -- Dumbledore could have joined himself, and made short work of both the monster of the chamber, and Riddle.

Did he, or did he not, task Hermione and Harry with Sirius' rescue operation, knowing that they were going to be facing Dementors?

The only reason the Ministry is even able to foist Umbridge as a teacher is because Dumbledore was unable to find anyone else to assume the position, which is kind of unbelievable when you realise that Albus is a man with many, many connections, from being in positions of political power on a global scale for nearly fifty years. Ablus not being able to find a candidate for an open post is flat out unbelievable.

The Draco Malfoy redemption attempt is disgusting. The lives of Katie Bell, Horace Slughorn, and Rosemerta take a backseat because Albus liked playing games. One accident, and Katie, Slughorn or Rosemerta could have died. Rosemerta might even have been raped. Rape committed by juveniles is rape all the same, and juveniles are just as capable of it as adults are. Whether Malfoy actually does it or not, we'll never know. But he does cast the Imperius curse on her, and that's worth a lifetime in Azkaban.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore had tried to act according to the law and in cooperation with the Ministry of Magic,
#+end_quote

He runs a vigilante organisation -- which is definitely not in accordance with any law. He helps Sirius escape, which is not in accordance with any law. He has the members of the vigilante organisation infiltrate and stake out parts of the Ministry -- and I'm sure that too is not in accordance with any law.

  killing multiple persons on the account of Harry alone
#+end_quote

So, believing the resurrection of Voldemort on Harry's word is okay, but believing Harry's word on the present Death Eaters is not? Very strange. And inconsistent.

#+begin_quote
  I fail to see how that would have benefited anybody in any way. And let's not imagine he could have killed all of them at once with just a snap of his fingers. He's Dumbledore, not Thanos. One of them dead, and he'd been on the run from the law earlier than he had been, and the children Hogwarts less protected.
#+end_quote

Only innocent lives. The Death Eaters kill during the war -- those deaths might have been averted if preemptive action was taken. That you can't see the benefit of innocent people living their lives in peace is quite the curiosity.

And why would he be on the run from the law when presumed Death Eaters start going missing? Not even Fudge accuses people of murder without sufficient proof.

#+begin_quote
  I'm pretty sure that it was stated that A. Harry had to be the one to decide to sacrifice himself, not be told by Dumbledore to do it, and B. Voldemort had to kill him, and not any random person, not even Dumbledore. I'm not sure he delegated anything to Snape, if anything, he most probably did not expect to die that night on the astronomy tower, and Snape couldn't have told Harry much if he hadn't accidentally been there when he died, either.
#+end_quote

This block of text proves yet again, you didn't bother to understand what I wrote at all, or why I wrote what I wrote.

The difficult choice that he supposedly makes -- he could have had the decency to end Harry's life himself. Like Snape says, Albus basically raises Harry like a pig for slaughter. Starved for affection, routinely exposed to dangerous situations with Albus' knowledge, and lives a pitiful life, all in all. All because of the horcrux in his head -- Albus could have given Harry a mercy killing, and prevented a lifetime filled with sadness and hardship -- but chickens out of that. Snape performs a mercy killing on Albus, but Albus himself cannot do the same with Harry.

Seriously, have you actually ever read the books? He has Snape tell Harry (indirectly) about the horcrux inside his head -- Albus does not have the decency or the courage to do it himself.
