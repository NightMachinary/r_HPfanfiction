Just as I thought, it was wasted effort on my part to ask you to not reply unless you had something concrete. You've taken my words out of context, and twisted the intent behind them to fuel your presumptions. For future reference, avoid this when you try arguing again. Or at least, try to avoid that. Your arguments will be even more of a joke if you don't.

The only thing you've managed to keep a more or less objective view on is this:

#+begin_quote
  What if, seeing as how they were about to kill each other, Albus tried to intervene and deflected a killing curse?
#+end_quote

Fair enough. There's /actually/ something valid here.

The rest of that wall of text is an emotional tirade that goes on and on. There's nonsense about giving people second chances after they've committed crimes which are unforgivable in the eyes of the people and the law, the hilariously ludicrous idea of fighting wars without killing, a few personal attacks here and there when I've talked about things you don't understand, more ranting about morals and acceptance at the cost of public safety, the list goes on and on. I'm not actually going to reply individually to those things, because frankly, there are better ways to waste time.
