Are you trying to tell me that you and any person you consider decent have never been a child, nor thought of yourself, only ever of others? Trying to live your own life, or at least dream of it for a little while is what I consider to be human nature and you to be fashionable and human indecency. I suspect this is something two people will not be able to agree on since it probably depends on the society one lives in whether one views humans as individuals or part of a community first and whether the pursuit of happiness will be seen as selfish and evil or as the right of every man and woman.

Exactly, he said he did not know whether he cast the spell that killed his sister. But what happened on that day? It is said that when Aberforth confronted them because their plan would not have worked out for Ariana, Gellert was so incensed he used the Cruciatus on him. But that could not have been all. Have even heavier curses, maiming and killing curses been thrown back and forth between the two? We know that Aberforth was a few years younger than Albus and described as somebody who did not much care for school, could he have been a match for Gellert in a duel? What if, seeing as how they were about to kill each other, Albus tried to intervene and deflected a killing curse? Or what if he tried to attack Gellert despite the blood oath and triggert something that could have hurt bystanders? We were told that Albus was not only devastated by Ariana's death, but also didn't expect Gellert to leave after the fiasco. I cannot imagine that he would have tried Avada Kedavra on either Aberforth or Gellert, and none of us know what had happened on that day, which is why I initially did not want to speculate, as it is all eiter of us can do to speculate and it is a waste of time to argue about something neither of us knows, but there you have it, if you insist. My personal guess is that, if you must use that analogy, that Gellert pulled the gun on Aberforth and by going between them, somehow Albus misfired the weapon in Ariana's direction, if it was his fault at all, since we don't know that either.

Well, the wizarding communities are not nations, even though they look to be so. They are tiny and not very well organized. Still I cannot fathom why you should be the one to judge whether they deserve to survive or not. Who gave you the right to decide whether anyone or anything that does not belong to you personally gets to suvive or not? You also still do not get to decide what the moral responsibilities of Albus in the case of Gellert and Ariana was. This is not an argument, it is a statement of fact.

Yes, accidents happen at all times. Now, if you use your imagination, you can see what would happen to all things and all people if we stopped doing anything that might ever cause an accident. I dare say that as long as everything that exist is not yet wiped off the face of the earth, nothing can be completely safe. On such a worthless argument do you decide that Remus should never have gotten the chance to live a semi-normal life, not one day in his life after he was bitten at 4. What can I say to that? Would you also isolate children with psychological and physical diseases from others on the odd chance that it could prove harmful to others despite the fact that it had not yet ever happened? From the get go, he deserved a chance, in hindsight, nothing happened. Yet still you advocate discrimination and isolation of those with ailments, as I've said. At the same time you presume to judge other people for being morally corrupt and indecent because they have hopes and dreams.

Blood protection protected Harry from Voldemort and his followers, which would have resulted in his death as a young child. It did not, nor was it ever stated that it did, protect him from accidents and the fould moods of humans, nor was this ever the aim of the blood protection. Of course Albus, because he is kind of heart, would still feel remorse that he couldn't protect Harry from Petunia and Vernon, but he had to choose the lesser evil of the two, and he was right to do so.

He did store the stone at the school, because it was the most protected place in the universe of Harry Potter that we know, even more than Gringotts, where it would have been stolen.

He did not send Fawkes into the Chamber, as he did not even know the children were in the chamber until afterwards. I would like to remind you that he was rather surprised and touched because Harry "must have shown real loyalty (to Albus), nothing else could have called Fawkes to him".

He tasked Hermione and Harry with the rescue of Sirius, /not/ knowing that they would have to face the dementors. Only afterwards did it become clear that the person who fought off the dementors was Harry himself, before, it was unclear how it happened, and it was not suspected to have anything to do with their little time-travel at all.

You will believe what you will believe, but that was just how it was stated in the books.

Where did you get the disgusting notion of Draco having raped Rosmerta from? That is indeed disgusting. And I'm glad it's only in your head.

Albus was a man who believed in second chances. He believed in Hagrid, even though he did not know the truth of what happened back then, he gave Remus an education, he believed Snape, who served him loyally to the end, and he gave Draco a second chance, and Draco proved to be indecisive whether he really wanted to support Voldemort, and it was through his presence that Narcissa saved Harry's life and with it, the outcome of the war.

Believing Harry is one thing, murdering multiple people on his words alone another. Albus does not kill easily, nor does he kill preemptively (Riddle), that doesn't make him an indecent person, quite on the contrary. If you believe in preemptive killing as a solution to problems, it is not his decency we must question, but yours.

And what has Fudge not accused people of without sufficient proof? What have his people, like Umbridge, not done to reach their ends? Can there be any doubt that he would have pointed at Albus and his people if those accused by Harry have started to go missing shortly afterwards?

On the contrary, I do not think you read anything I wrote, nor what was in the books, /Voldemort had to kill Harry for the Horncrux to be destroyed, not Albus, and Harry had to be willing for it/. Since Albus had not ever been Voldemort in his life, he could not have killed Harry to destroy the Horncrux. Also it was pure accident, like I said, that Harry was there when Snape died, otherwise he would never have been told about the last horncrux and how to destroy it at all. I really wish you would read before you answered.
