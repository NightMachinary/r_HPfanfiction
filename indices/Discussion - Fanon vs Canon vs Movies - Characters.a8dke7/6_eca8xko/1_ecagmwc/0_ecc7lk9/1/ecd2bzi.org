  So, nothing you said proves that Dumbledore is less than a very strong, intelligent, and most of all, decent person. But it must be fun to bash a person without whom everything since the beginnings of Grindelwald almost 100 years ago would have gone to shit, who worked tirelessly against evil and for the preserving of life and peace, giving his own life in its course, because you would have done it much better.

More like you didn't bother trying to understand a single thing in my comment, and proceeded to launch into a tirade against an evil internet user who dared criticise your hero. Your tirade wanders off on tangents several times, and you take a couple of shots at me along the way. When you do remember to make arguments in favour of Albus, they're paper thin. I have not said that Albus is evil, or whatever else it is that bashes his character. I said that he's neither a decent person, nor one who makes difficult choices and I have given out instances to back my statement.

I'd suggest that you take a step back, and try and understand the matter that you read, although I believe it will be wasted effort on my part to do do so. Oh well. At the very least, don't bother replying unless you have something concrete to say.
