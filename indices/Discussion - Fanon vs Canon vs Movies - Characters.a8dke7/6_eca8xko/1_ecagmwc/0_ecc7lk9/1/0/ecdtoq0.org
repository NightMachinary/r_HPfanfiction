What you did was exactly to bash his character. But arguments against your way of thinking might always be paper thin in your eyes, I wouldn't know. I would like to suggest you do what you adviced me, namely read the books, and read what I have written, if you should want to answer, because otherwise it just wouldn't make sense.

And surprise! Just like you don't get to decide what other people should do or think, you don't get to decide whether I reply or not.
