I'll just list a few of the radical changes some characters underwent. All in all, I prefer canon interpretations.

--------------

Canon Dumbledore: a hyper-intelligent, decent person, who, when confronted with an impossible situation made an extremely difficult choice to save as many lives as possible.

Movie Dumbledore: Same, but with less nuance as to his motives. Decent acting all around.

Fanon Dumbledore: Depends on the fic, but he's either a Dark Lord, incompetent, or both. I absolutely detest most fanon Dumbledores.

--------------

Canon Draco: a straight up jerk with basically zero redeeming qualities.

Movie Draco: omg Tom Felton is hot. I don't prefer this version because it makes him seem more likeable than he really is.

Fanon Draco: Draco is either a saint or truly worse person in fanon. I do like giving him some iota of redemption, so that he's not just a big butt monkey.

--------------

Canon Ron: a funny, smart, loyal friend.

Movie Ron: a dumb boy who says dumb boy things and has had his lines stolen by Hermione.

Fanon Ron: actually worse than Hitler. Also a huge jerk - huger than Canon Draco. Might also be a rapist. Yeah, this version is the worst.

--------------

Canon Hermione: a smart, hardworking witch with, shall we say, some issues. My preferred version.

Movie Hermione: a funny, smart, loyal friend. She's basically Canon Ron with the natural smarts of Hermione.

Fanon Hermione: or, as called by everyone, Mione, even though Ron only did it once in canon, when his mouth was filled with food. She's the smartest, most perfect person ever. She's a natural leader. She can duel Voldemort no problem. If she has any flaws, it's that she always, always, follows the rules (canon Hermione literally committed a serious crime every single year, sometimes several). Yeah, not a fan of most versions.

--------------

Canon Snape: a disgusting, cruel man who, while redeemed by love, was still a piece of dog poop his entire life.

Movie Snape: Alan Rickman. This is one of the few movie depictions I prefer. Because Alan Rickman.

Fanon Snape: depends. He's either Alan Rickman or Alan Rickman But Hotter.
