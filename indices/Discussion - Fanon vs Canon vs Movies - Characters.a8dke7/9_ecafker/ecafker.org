Unpopular opinion, but I actually prefer fanon Harry more than canon Harry. I am not talking just about Gary Stu fics, even fics that try to stay true to Harry's canon character, usually portray him as more interesting than in canon.

I don't dislike canon Harry, but I always felt like he was a bit bland and passive as a character. This is especially true in the movies, but even in the books it sometimes felt this way.
