I wish the movies had kept the same Actors and Actresses for named characters. Susan Bones, Hannah Abbot, LAVENDER BROWN.../cough/ but generally I think casting was on point. If Gambon would have softened his voice a bit to mimick Richard Harris, at least until Dumbledore needed to sack up and be impressive again, I think I would even have liked him... but he DID make it super easy to see manipulative or evil Dumbledore.

My biggest casting WTF is Slughorn... I always pictured him as a nicer version of Vernon. Like the Walrus from Alice in Wonderland that was trying to eat the clams.

Also... Poor Bonnie Wright... She was cute as a kid, but she did not grow up to be the Ginny I picture in my head. Made it super easy for me to fall for Hermione or Luna or any other girl. I'm not sure I'd have continued being a Ginny Fanboy even if she'd been given more time and character development in the movies.
