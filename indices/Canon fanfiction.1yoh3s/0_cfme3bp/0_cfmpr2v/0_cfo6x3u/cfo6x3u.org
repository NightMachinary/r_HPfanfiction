I should probably note that each fic run on a separate timeline (posting wise), not as sequels to each other. Her earlier side-fics and oneshots aren't 100% canon in character names, but for the main ones they're fairly updated canon wise(Aside from Draco marrying Daphne instead of Astoria, and George Katie instead of Angelina off the top of my head). Out of the main series fics, only The First Day is finished. The rest are still WIP, although she updates fairly frequently.
