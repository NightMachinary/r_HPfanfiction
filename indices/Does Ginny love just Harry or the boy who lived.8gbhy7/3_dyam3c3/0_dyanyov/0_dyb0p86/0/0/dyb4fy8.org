  you have to say the same for Neville
#+end_quote

Um, sure, I guess? I meam, Neville probably had more dialogue since he was around more, but otherwise I don't think this comparison does much for Ginny. Neville wasn't anything until OoTP, and really wasn't relevant until the end of DH.

  I never said the possession made her deep
#+end_quote

Well my mistake. You mentioned it immediately after saying she was complex. And the only role that played afterward was a brief line to get Harry to stop acting like an idiot. And even then, unless I'm misremembering the sequence of events, it required Hermione to get to that point. Also, I don't recall the Dementors affecting Ginny in any particularly special way (maybe I've forgotten).

  Regarding not wanting to be caged, Rowling put plenty of subtext in the book to show Ginny wanting to be seen as an independent capable witch who didn't need to be sheltered
#+end_quote

Ok, this seems to be a shift. Not wanting to be coddled, wanting to be part of the action, and going for joy rides without parental permission has nothing to do with not wanting to be "caged". It's literally the /most/ teenager-y behavior. Hell, even in HP basically all those things you listed happened for other characters (with the exception of the Dean thing). PS mentions several examples of students at the very least boasting about solo escapades on brooms. Every teen at the Grimmauld Place in OoTP argued about being in the Order and wanted to fight in the last battle.

That list you made makes my points for me, just look how trivial many of these are (especially in fantasy, even more so in HP):

#+begin_quote
  she can be jealous

  she can be a bit childish but

  desperately wants to be treated as an adult

  she is fiercely independent she is very loyal, particularly to Harry (I don't think this is even true, or if it is literally every actual friend Harry has would be equally so, some more than her)

  she knows how to attack someone at their most vulnerable point
#+end_quote

These apply to nearly every named character or friend of Harry's, and those that don't are traits everyone exhibits at times. My point is pretty simple I think: Ginny just had hardly any characterization and so she just couldn't be made a complex character. And really, there was no way to do it given when she entered the series, her family situation (same happened to Ron, completely irrelevant after Book 2), and the friendship H/Hr/Ron formed in book 1.

I don't hate her, but in my view, that's only because there's not enough to her to hate (although I suppose one can target their dislike at that lack of characterization).
