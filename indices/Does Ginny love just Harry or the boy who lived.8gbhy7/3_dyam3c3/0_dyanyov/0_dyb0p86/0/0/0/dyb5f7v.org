You are saying she lacks characterization. Whether some of her characteristics are shared with other characters doesn't negate the fact that she does have characterization. You literally said she is just a sporty girl who had a crush and can be tough, which clearly is not all there is to her.

You did forget about the Dementors.

My list of her traits is meant to show she isn't just a blank slate, that there is actual characterization and yes, some of those traits are flaws. It's what makes her an interesting character, in that she isn't just this perfect embodiment of a partner for Harry. She has flaws, desires, personality. The traits I listed could apply to other characters, but they are very important to her character. Her desire to rebel against the constraints placed on her is far more pronounced than any other character. Hermione never displays some great desire to be seen as an adult and let loose, nor Ron, nor Harry.

Regarding the caged point, I would just disagree with your interpretation of what it means to be caged and whether Ginny was fighting against that. I think the text is clear she is in a constant fight against others trying to keep her safe or protected. Sure, it's a teenagery thing, but in the books, Rowling specifically highlights this trait in Ginny. I think only Harry ever truly has equal moments of despair over the adults not including him in things.

Where you are correct is that the way Ginny is brought into the story makes it difficult for her character to be fully fleshed out and expanded upon. Being from Harry's POV, where he doesn't really notice Ginny as a big part in his life until book 6, it is tough to see Ginny as more than just some random character. But the same is mostly true of the vast majority of characters in the series, save Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, and a few others. Rowling does give Ginny characterization, just like she does the rest of the Weasleys and most of Harry's housemates. Occasionally she becomes more important to the story and we learn more about her, just like other characters. It ebbs and flows. I am simply arguing that she is a strong character who Rowling doesn't allow to reach her full potential. There is complexity there but Rowling never pauses long enough to allow us to explore that.
