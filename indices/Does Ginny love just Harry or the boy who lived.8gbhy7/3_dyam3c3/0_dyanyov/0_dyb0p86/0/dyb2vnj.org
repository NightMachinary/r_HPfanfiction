Wow, clearly we weren't reading the same book. She was a side character on par with Neville up until the 6th book, I agree. They each had their moments but this was primarily a story revolving around the trio, no disagreement there. If you are going to argue Ginny as a irrelevant side character, you have to say the same for Neville. I wish she played a greater role in the series overall, but it is what it is.

I never said the possession made her deep, but it did allow her to have a specific tie to Harry that no other person could relate to. I agree the development was off screen and we don't really see much of its affect on Ginny. But there are snippets. The effect Dementors have on her, for one. And of course when she calls Harry out on forgetting she was possessed, it demonstrates that it still to that day had an affect on her. I wish we saw more of that, but it's ultimately not Ginny's story.

Regarding not wanting to be caged, Rowling put plenty of subtext in the book to show Ginny wanting to be seen as an independent capable witch who didn't need to be sheltered. Examples include:

- fighting her mother to be allowed to hear what's going on with the Order in OOTP
- stealing her brothers brooms to go flying
- arguing with her mother to be able to fight in the last battle
- her patronus being a wild mare
- she broke up with Dean because he tried to coddle her

Ginny's character certainly wasn't in your face. But it's there. She us far from a Daphne Greengrass, who literally has one reference. Here are some things we know about Ginny:

- she has a dry cutting sense of humor, and does some good impressions, and Harry and her share their sense of humor
- she can be jealous
- she can be a bit childish but desperately wants to be treated as an adult
- she is fiercely independent (in the battle of the Department of Mysteries, she refuses help after hurting her ankle; also her relationship with Dean)
- she is very loyal, particularly to Harry
- she knows how to attack someone at their most vulnerable point
- she has a hot temper when challenged
- she has a good understanding of what Harry needs in a given moment (library scene in OOTP, Christmas confrontation at Grimmauld Place in OOTP, defending Harry after the Sectumsempra incident in HBP, accepting the break up in HBP)
- confident in herself

Despite not having a huge role in the series, we do know a lot about Ginny, and these are not irrelevant traits because a lot of them relate to her relationship with Harry.

I would totally agree with you that we didn't get enough of her in the series, and the actual relationship with Harry could've been done a lot better, but it's simply incorrect to sa she had virtually no characterization.
