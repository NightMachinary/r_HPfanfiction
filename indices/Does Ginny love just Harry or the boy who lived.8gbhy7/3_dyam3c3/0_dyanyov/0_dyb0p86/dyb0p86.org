For the entire series she was a side character. Her most prominent role came in the 6th book... as haphazard romance material. Short of having no lines, it's harder to get more side character-y.

Being possessed doesn't make your character deep. Nothing about that incident was shown to have changed her and it had zero ramifications for her down the road. I've no idea what you're talking about with her not wanting to be caged. I don't really care to hate on people for their ships (unless it's just some bizarre shit like Harry/Riddle or Hermione/Any Death Eater), but Ginny's character was basically: she's the sporty one like Harry, she had a childhood crush on Harry because reasons and she can be tough (because of some unexplored hex she's good at). I mean, take away those extremely minor character traits and she's as undefined as, I dunno, Daphne Greengrass.
