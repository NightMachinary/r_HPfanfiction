I think this comment is half right. For too much of the series she was treated as a side character. I was bitterly disappointed with how she was used in Deathly Hallows and felt that we didn't get nearly enough of her in HBP

But we do know a lot about her and her character is quite complex. She has a compelling backstory (the possession), character growth (shy girl around Harry who was "weak" by being taken in by the diary to strong woman leading the resistance while winning Harry's affection) and strong motivation for her actions (fear of being caged), yet sometimes her actions betray her desires, furthering her depth. The problem is we just don't see enough of it. The characterization doesn't smack you in the face.
