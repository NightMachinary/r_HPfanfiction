Actually Ginny of anyone does understand the complexity of his emotions towards Voldemort since she is the only one touched in the same way as him. Honestly, I don't see what point you're trying to make here. Nothing in their interaction suggests a lack of understanding of who Harry is. Quite the opposite, Ginny has the read on Harry exactly. She does understand the depth of why he feels the need to go after him. She is his friend and is familiar with his history. She knows that Harry would not rest until he took down Voldemort, could not be happy living a life knowing he was still out there. Think about why she was so accepting of the break up, /because/ she fully understands his desire to protect those he loves because of those he lost.
