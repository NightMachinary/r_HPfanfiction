  Colin follows Harry around, he takes pictures, he's always trying to get Harry to talk to him, and Harry is constantly annoyed with him. Ginny is quite the opposite: she is quiet, shy, and gives Harry his space, and he holds nothing against her.

Not everyone acts the same way. When it comes to fangirls/fanbois, those who obsessively follow their idols around are probably even in the minority. Most of them just admire/adore them from afar and idolize everything about them.

  However, Ginny did not mean that Harry was all smiling to go to war with Voldemort. She meant that she knew that his personality and morality could not deter him from his mission, because he could not let Voldemort continue rampaging, and she knew that he was going to do the right thing no matter what. Ginny knows that Harry wouldn't be able to bear leaving her, but she also knows that he wouldn't be able to bear not confronting the Voldemort threat, which was alluded to in Harry's conversation with Dumbledore earlier on

Which is still an extremely one-dimensional approach to Harry's character that casts him in the role of the hero in his very own movie. She clearly sees him as the guy who charges to the rescue of the damsel in the Chamber of Secrets and she doesn't appear to have any understanding of or appreciation for the complexity in Harry's motivations and emotions about Voldemort, the death of his parents, protection of his friends and a prophecy over his head.

  And Harry knows exactly what Ginny means, because he isn't taking an issue with it like he did with all the swarms of fans during the earlier books.

Harry doesn't take issue with lots of things that he should take issue with. Harry not taking issue with something as evidence that it is not something to take issue with is one of the worst arguments you could come up with.
