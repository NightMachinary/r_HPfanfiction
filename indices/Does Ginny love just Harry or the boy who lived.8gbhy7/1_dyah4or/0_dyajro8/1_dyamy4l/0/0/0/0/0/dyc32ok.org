  but the housewife comment was out of proportion, because that is a misunderstanding of both Ginny's character and that moment

Again, the misunderstanding is not on my part, but on Rowling's. Ginny - as she has been previously characterized - wouldn't demurely respect her husband-to-be's wishes. She would flip the fuck out over Harry's "I'm going to protect you by breaking up with you" and not just stand there, smile at him and tell him that she totally understands and expected this.

This is the girl that broke up with a boyfriend because he was trying to help her too much. It's as if Rowling replaced her with some kind of pure-blood princess who's waiting for her arranged marriage, knitting tiny little sweaters for their future kids.

That scene is a complete joke.
