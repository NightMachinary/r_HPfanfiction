The point is that even in this "out of character" moment, Ginny never said or implied that she would stick around and do nothing. Nowhere in that scene was it ever indicated or implied that she would do that. So we can talk about if and how that moment was out of character for her, but the housewife comment was out of proportion, because that is a misunderstanding of both Ginny's character and that moment.
