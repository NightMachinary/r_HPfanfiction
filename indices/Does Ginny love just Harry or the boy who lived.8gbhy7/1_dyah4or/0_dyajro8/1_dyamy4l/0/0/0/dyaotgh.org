  The fact that you can say something like this demonstrates how little you know of Ginny's character.

This is silly! I literally wrote that this is stupid, because this characterization is incredible out of character for her. Why quote me out of context?

#+begin_quote
  Ginny on the other hand *is explaining* to her romantic interest why she *is acting completely out of character* and staying behind like a demure little house-wife.

Ginny would never just sit back and let Harry do his thing, just because he is worried about her safety or something like that. So JKR had to come up with this stupid line for her, because she missed the train on including Ginny in the trio. Would have been awkward storytelling-wise to suddenly bring her along.
