  Something obviously changed between Ginny's reactions in the first two books. If she was indeed a shallow fangirl why didn't she just keep her reaction from the first book?

But, she wasn't at all like Colin. She didn't follow him around obsessively did she? She was too shy to approach him.

This is what you wrote:

  Ginny is just excited to see him

It's not like she changed from a Colin-like personality to something else.

  Also, it's written that at that moment "they understood each other perfectly"

Oh yeah and Harry is totally good at understanding others emotions and motivations: *cough* Snape *cough* Dumbledore

  "He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat. "I'd want him finished," said Harry quietly. "And I'd want to do it.""

It's a narrative device. This is closing a part of Harry's arc in the heroes jorney: He is accepting his mission and does what needs to be done. Ginny on the other hand is explaining to her romantic interest why she is acting completely out of character and staying behind like a demure little house-wife. I'd certainly want to express myself clearly and not make such ambiguous statements if I truly had this great connection to my partner. I'd want to make it clear that I truly understood them, by not saying something that could have been said *exactly the same way* by someone who has no understanding of Harry at all and only knew him from the Daily Prophet.

She is lucky that Harry is such a gentle soul and always wants to think the best of people no matter what (unless he's throwing a tantrum). He's probably going through the same mental gymnastics you just did so that he can understand her perfectly.
