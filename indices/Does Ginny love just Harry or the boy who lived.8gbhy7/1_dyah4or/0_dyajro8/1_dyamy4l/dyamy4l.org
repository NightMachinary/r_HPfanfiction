  Not everyone acts the same way.

Sure, that may be the case. But you saying this to defend your stance that "Ginny-is-a-fangirl" shows that you are simply working backwards from your conclusion. Something obviously changed between Ginny's reactions in the first two books. If she was indeed a shallow fangirl why didn't she just keep her reaction from the first book? Again, why was she shown to understand Harry's struggles with fame even in /CoS/?

Hint: it's because she isn't one.

  Which is still an extremely one-dimensional approach to Harry's character that casts him in the role of the hero in his very own movie.

"He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat. "I'd want him finished," said Harry quietly. "And I'd want to do it.""

He is saying that he wants to be the one to hunt Voldemort down. Ginny is literally saying the same thing. Also, it's written that at that moment "they understood each other perfectly". Sure sounds like Ginny doesn't understand anything of what Harry is going through, or that she's having a "one dimensional approach".

  Harry doesn't take issue with lots of things that he should take issue with.

Maybe, but when it comes to this issue, Harry not reacting the way he does to shallow hero worshippers does prove my point. The issue is what Harry thinks about fangirls/fanboys, which is clearly negatively. Externalizing it to the other things that he ignores doesn't help your argument.
