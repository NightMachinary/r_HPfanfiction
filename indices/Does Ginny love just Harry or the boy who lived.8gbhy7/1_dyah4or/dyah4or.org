At the beginning, all Harry is, from Ginny's point of view, is just a figure of wizarding stories and history. Ginny is just excited to see him. However, even Ron and Hermione do the same. Hermione, for instance, instead of squealing, she was busy talking about him in all the books she had read. Fred and George exhibit similar reactions. They are all excited to see the BWL, and who wouldn't be? Why should Ginny be singled out?

Also, it is confirmed in Goblet of Fire that Ginny's crush on Harry began only in /Chamber of Secrets/, not in /PS/, when her reaction changes to having actual, genuine feelings for him, even if immature, since she knows about him a lot more. Why would this be the case? We get the answer from Arthur Weasley: “Good Lord, is it Harry Potter? Very pleased to meet you, Ron's told us so much about --”. Being his best friend, what Ron said made a very nice picture indeed, and Ginny starts to understand him a little better, and therefore has a crush on him. In fact, she even knows that Harry doesn't like the fame, and defends him on that basis from Draco Malfoy at the Flourish and Blotts bookshop. Therefore, even in /CoS/, she does indeed see him as a real and genuine person, compared to characters like Romilda Vane. And in /OotP/, again, when Harry is complaining about the Daily Prophet, Ginny understands that he doesn't want his fame.

However, not only is there is an explicit difference between the way Ginny acts in /PS/ and the way she acts in /CoS/, Ginny's character is portrayed fundamentally different to Colin's, who is someone who is definitely a fanboy. Ginny acts around Harry, and the way Colin reacts, which is how you'd expect a hero-worshipper to react - as well as a clear difference between her reaction in /PS/ and in /CoS/. Colin follows Harry around, he takes pictures, he's always trying to get Harry to talk to him, and Harry is constantly annoyed with him. Ginny is quite the opposite: she is quiet, shy, and gives Harry his space, and he holds nothing against her.

One other key moment that is used to tar Ginny with the “fangirl” label is when she says in /Half Blood Prince/ “I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldn't be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort. Maybe that's why I like you so much.” However, Ginny did not mean that Harry was all smiling to go to war with Voldemort. She meant that she knew that his personality and morality could not deter him from his mission, because he could not let Voldemort continue rampaging, and she knew that he was going to do the right thing no matter what. Ginny knows that Harry wouldn't be able to bear leaving her, but she also knows that he wouldn't be able to bear not confronting the Voldemort threat, which was alluded to in Harry's conversation with Dumbledore earlier on. And Harry knows exactly what Ginny means, because he isn't taking an issue with it like he did with all the swarms of fans during the earlier books.

I'm just putting this out there for anyone who is genuinely wondering (and this is a genuine question to be asked), because this is yet another troll topic, by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8esbrp/why_is_ronhermione_hated_so_much/dxxt288/?context=3&st=jgfsg1zr&sh=68961d7e][someone behind all of these accounts]].
