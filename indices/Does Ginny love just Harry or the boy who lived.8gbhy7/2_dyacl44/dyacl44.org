Not sure if this is going to be a very productive topic. People are just going to believe what they want to believe: H/G fans are going to cite their fight in Grimauld Place as a sign that she doesn't put Harry on a pedastal and people like me are going to point out that she probably knows Harry just as little as we get to know Ginny and that she seems to have a fundamental misunderstanding about who Harry is ("I can't say I'm surprised. I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldn't be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort").

At the very least - if you want to claim that she fell in love with Harry - you'll have to imagine some very deep heart to heart conversations between the two in HBP. This requires a huge leap of faith, because for some reason they weren't important enough to be in the book.

Edit: Oh and I forgot to say that the problem is exacerbated by the fact that Harry's side of the romance is terrible too. The "chest monster" has been mocked more than enough already, so I'm not going to go into it, but it may have helped if Harry's attraction hadn't felt so artificial (it was in fact so badly written that it inspired tons of PotionQueen!Ginny fanfics)
