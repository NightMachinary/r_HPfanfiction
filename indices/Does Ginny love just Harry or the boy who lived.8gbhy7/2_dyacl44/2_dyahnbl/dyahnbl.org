On topic: I actually never heard of that rationale in which Ginny has a /fundamental misunderstanding/ about who Harry is. Of course, thinking about it makes a lot of sense even if I do like Harry and Ginny together. I think what bothers me the most about their romance is that they "fell in love" when they were teenagers on the eve of a civil war. Molly said it best that desperate times make desperate people in Half-Blood Prince (when she was referencing Bill and Fleur's upcoming wedding). Harry doesn't seem to change all that much from before the Horcrux hunt to after it (which is surprising given all that he'd witnessed and been through). Things of that nature don't casually wear away but stick with you for a good remainder of your life. And while Ginny may/could have helped him with memories (or nightmares) from the war, she couldn't have done the same with the Horcrux hunt. This could've lead down the road where she doesn't understand what he /went through/ paired together with a misunderstanding of who he is as well. Interesting, Deathcrow, very interesting.
