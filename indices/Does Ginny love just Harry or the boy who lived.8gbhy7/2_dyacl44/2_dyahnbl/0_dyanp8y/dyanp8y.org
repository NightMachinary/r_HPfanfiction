I respectfully disagree with the premise. Part of what supporters of the pairing like myself constantly point to is the fact that Ginny works well for Harry in part because she /does/ fully understand who he is. Ginny is actually completely right; Harry won't be happy unless he is the one who hunts him down and finishes him off. But Ginny also understands what Harry wants in life, which is just a normal life. That's what she provides him those few weeks they are together. And Ginny knows when he is about to break it off that it's coming and why it's happening. /Because/ she fundamentally understands who he is and what he needs. Think about all the major moments between the two from OOTP on. There is a pattern of Ginny knowing just what to say to Harry, or just what he needs.
