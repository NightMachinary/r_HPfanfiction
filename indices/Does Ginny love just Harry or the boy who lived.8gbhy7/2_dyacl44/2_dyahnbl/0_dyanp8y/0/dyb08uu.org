Um, was that a mystery to anyone? Who thought Harry wanted to leave Voldemort to anyone else? Many people (namely adults like Molly) /wanted/ Harry to leave it to the adults, but next to no one ever voiced the belief that Harry wanted to leave Voldemort to others; literally all of OoTP is replete with examples of Harry wanting to be brought in to help fight Voldemort, the entire book. It would be impossible to believe that given his heroics at Hogwarts involving Voldemort were known to all the students.

I don't understand where this belief comes from.
