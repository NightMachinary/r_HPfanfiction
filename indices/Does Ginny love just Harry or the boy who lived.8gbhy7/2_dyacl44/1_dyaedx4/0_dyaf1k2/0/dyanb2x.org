I always point to the scene in HBP in the common room where Harry and Ginny are casually chilling and cracking jokes. She's reading while leaning on his leg. I think this points to the fundamental difference between Ginny and Cho. With Cho it was awkward, but with Ginny it's entirely comfortable and normal. It's not much but it does show a realistic, intimate relationship. Anyone who has been in a LTR, truly loving relationship can point to similar moments like the one they shared.

I agree there was far too little of these intimate moments, but there were enough to show that Harry and Ginny's relationship was deeper than typical high school romance.
