  Off topic, but did any characters have heart to heart conversations in the HP books?

Depends on what you mean. For me "heart to heart" conversations doesn't mean just "lovey dovey" stuff and I think the trio had plenty of 'intimate' (for lack of a better word) moments. Also we already know that they spend a lot of time with each other and actually have substantial conversations (that aren't just about the weather or elbows in a butter dish) so I don't have any difficulty imagining plenty of those "off screen".

IMHO Harry had more intimate moments with Luna than with Ginny, but I'm probably just trying to get him away from the Weasleys.
