Because people were downvoting your comments? If so, just ignore it. Cultivating an active and productive HP Fanfiction community can only be achieved when members themselves are active in it. In retrospect, people don't like when others have differing opinions and if that's so, that's there problem, not yours. And for some reason or another, those with contrasting thoughts tend to downvote users that don't share in their sentiments. However, from my point of view, your comments tend to make me smile.
