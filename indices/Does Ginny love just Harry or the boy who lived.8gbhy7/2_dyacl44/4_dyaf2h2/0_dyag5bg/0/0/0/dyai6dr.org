No, it wasn't just the mass downvoting 24/7 (which I don't care about anymore, as votes have no affect on anything on the site or the user; they are literally pointless). It was also all the rape apologists, child abuse apologists "it wasn't that bad, etc", and misogyny issues. A lot of posters here are severely disturbed, and it's horrible to watch.
