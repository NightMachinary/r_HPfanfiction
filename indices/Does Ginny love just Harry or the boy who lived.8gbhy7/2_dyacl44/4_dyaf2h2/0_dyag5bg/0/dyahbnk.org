I WAS gone. I'd decided that how it is here and how people are here was having a negative effect on my mental health, it was making me upset and frustrated all the time, so I left it and only did PM's with my friends and got my happiness back. And now i am thinking about coming back to the forum fully to participate again, but I'm not sure still. It will probably just ruin my mental health again.
