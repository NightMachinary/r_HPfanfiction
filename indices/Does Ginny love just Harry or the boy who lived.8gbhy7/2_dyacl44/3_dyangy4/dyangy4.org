I mentioned below the scene in the common room. Also in OOTP, the scene in the library is actually quite telling of what their future might hold. But it's a fair point we didn't see enough of it for a romance.

Honestly, I don't think Rowling necessarily intended for them to be totally in love during school. I think she really was just planting the seeds for them to wind up together. Clearly, Rowling portrayed them as quite compatible. If you do want to argue she wanted us to see them as in love with each other during the events of the book, then I'd chalk that up to the fact this is a fictional story and in most fantasy stories, the romantic aspect isn't fully fleshed out.
