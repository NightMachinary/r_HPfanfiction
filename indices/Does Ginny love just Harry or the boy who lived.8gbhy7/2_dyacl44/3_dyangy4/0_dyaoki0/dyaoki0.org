  Honestly, I don't think Rowling necessarily intended for them to be totally in love during school. I think she really was just planting the seeds for them to wind up together. Clearly, Rowling portrayed them as quite compatible. If you do want to argue she wanted us to see them as in love with each other during the events of the book, then I'd chalk that up to the fact this is a fictional story and in most fantasy stories, the romantic aspect isn't fully fleshed out.

That's okay. It's completely fair for them to have a normal high school relationship, which would be one among many in their young lives. What's just bad is to then turn around and go "Oh, btw Harry and Ginny are total soul mates and live happily ever after with their amazing family and everything is amazingly perfect" in the epilogue. That's what you have to show if you want to make definitive statements like this... or leave it open and everyone can imagine whatever they want. Imagine for a minute if it had been "Millicent Bullstrode" instead of Ginny... that's a little bit how people feel who don't get the Harry/Ginny thing: "Huh? Millicent? ... but... why? Okay I guess"

Fantasy stories, which are escapism, usually also have fantastical relationships. Fantasy readers will very easily accept (or even expect) that two people might be destined for each other. It absolutely boggles my mind that JKR knew beforehand who she wanted to end up together and still gave Ginny such a minor role. There would have been so many great opportunities to show how an amazing couple might complement each other, but I have the sneaking suspicion that JKR really doesn't see this in the same light as I do, considering how she wrote Ron/Hermione. It probably would have been even worse if Ginny had a bigger role.
