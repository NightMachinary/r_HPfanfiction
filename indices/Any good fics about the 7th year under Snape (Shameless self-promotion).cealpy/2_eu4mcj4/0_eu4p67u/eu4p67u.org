I'm sorry if this sounds like I'm milking you for compliments (because I am), but by "freaking fantastic" are you referring to my fic or to the one you link to (which I will definitely read ASAP)?\\
If you're referring to mine - thanks, all of it is intentional :D Because I know the nature of trauma is such that someone time is warped and everything seems either disconnected or to be repeating itself, I wanted the story to feel this way to. Aaand I enjoy thinking of everybody's motivations and how everyone is the hero of their own story.\\
I'm really enjoying writing it :)
