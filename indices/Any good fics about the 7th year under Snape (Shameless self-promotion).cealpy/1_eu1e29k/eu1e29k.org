I tried to think very carefully about how Snape wpuld have balanced his role as Headmaster. With requests like this I also usually also link Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince, which is an excellent fic but I don't agree with the authors interpretation of Snape there - he's too soft.

I do not recommend Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness.
