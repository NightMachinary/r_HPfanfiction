Hi, dug up this thread to let you know I read your story and it was great. The scene with Ginny and George especially.... The first time George said something wasn't funny was at Fred's death, it was so perfect! Was that intentional?

Also you really made me feel Tonks's love and courage and loss. Thank you.

May I ask you to reas mine? I don't think I am going to use your ideas for inspiration but I think I have pretty good ones cooking :)
