I searched for the author and found its Twitter account, but there has been no update to that account either since 2015. I am worried about something bad happening to the author, but I have no idea how to confirm its safety. At this point, I just wish it gave a signal of being active, so that our hope of reading the complete series someday can remain alive. :'(

It's so sad...I became quite invested in Harveste and his story. U_U
