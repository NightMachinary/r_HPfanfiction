I actually see the opposite more than the dumb boyfriend trope. I read Harry/Ginny post war and my biggest pet peeve is when they make the couple so over-the-top in love as to be ridiculous. Harry gets the perfect gifts and acts ideally towards Ginny. If anything, they have Ginny act a bit poorly as a girlfriend (not bad or anything, just little things). I wonder if the dumb boyfriend trope is more common in fics that take place during Harry's 6th year.

The biggest issue writers seem to have is to portray the couple as a typical teenage couple that have normal fights and act like their age or something around their age.
