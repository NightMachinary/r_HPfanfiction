I'd like to note that that was a transitory belief, as I stated in the OP, that I moved past that theory mainly because I was wrong about it being a feminist concept. I don't know much about feminism because it's a philosophy that has no relevance to me, and was not supposed to be the main or even secondary point of the post. However my, perhaps flawed,understanding was that feminism was the concept of achieving equality through empowerment. And a form of negative empowerment is to advance the stereotype of one gender being superior. Which the idea of "Women are smart, men are dumb" falls into quite adeptly. However. As I said, I moved away from that theory because negative empowerment isn't about creating strong people. It's about weak people cutting others down so they look strong. Which as has been concluded in this thread is just lazy writing.
