As a Feministâ„¢ I can tell you that putting women on a pedestal (treating them as delicate flowers, etc) is an idea that was, for example, used to deny US white women the vote (because women were Too Pure to get involved in the muck of politics) and a large number of feminists today cheer portrayals of women that are complicated, flawed, and far from perfect.

'Feminism is the radical idea that women are people.'
