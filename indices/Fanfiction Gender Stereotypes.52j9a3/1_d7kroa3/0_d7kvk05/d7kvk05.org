  Also, it apparently being ok for women to physically hurt their partners. This is a societal problem obviously, but it does rear it's ugly head in fanfic often.

This is almost certainly flowover from people who have both read HP and watch anime, because the trope of female-on-male violence is often played for laughs in anime romcoms, to the point where the hotheaded female love interest who resorts to physical violence whenever the protagonist annoys her, is a named trope (Tsundere). Lots of people who write relationships where the woman gets a free pass to hit their partners, are most likely teenagers who watch those kinds of animes and don't yet know enough about relationships to realise they're not how actual real-life ones work.
