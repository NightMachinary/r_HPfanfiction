In the case of Everybody Loves Raymond, I don't think the viewer was supposed to like Deb all that much. Ray is very much the "dumb dad" trope we saw gaining traction in the 90s, but Deb is hardly the the long-suffering, saintly wife we see in those commercials and shows: she's an unlikable hypocrite in denial, and the creators are in on the joke, because the way she gets away with the same behaviour that she lambastes Ray and the rest of the family for is almost blatant parody. People who think she's a strong, empowered woman are missing the point entirely.

I've seen the social experiments, and I'm not saying that Western society doesn't have problems that disenfranchise men, but the fics in question read like anime romcoms, down to the "it's not like I like you or anything" meme, and less like the dumb dad trope we see in Western media.
