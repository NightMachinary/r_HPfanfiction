I think you would be surprised. Half of the sitcoms out there play on this trope and they are written by and for grown adults. A prime example is Everybody Love Raymond. Raymond is always being slapped or punched by his wife when she is mad at him.

I've also seen plenty of adults and young adults that will slap or punch their partner because they said or did the wrong thing. There are those social experiment videos all over youtube that have a man being physically abused by a woman in public and in almost all of them, the people around either ignore the situation, laugh at it, or throw in their support for the woman. The common theme always seems to be that the the people who see it will only question "What did he do to get that?". When the videos show depict a male even raising his voice at woman, there are often many people stepping in to defend the woman.
