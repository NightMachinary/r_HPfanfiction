I've noticed a really irritating emphasis on purity combined with the eternally over-protective brothers and father trope... I get that is reality for some people but jesus christ it's everywhere, mostly as a way of causing conflict between Harry and the Weasleys. Similarly, the pearl clutching over revealing clothes pops up in otherwise good fics - even Northumbrian has used it to manufacture drama between Harry and Ginny.

Also, it apparently being ok for women to physically hurt their partners. This is a societal problem obviously, but it does rear it's ugly head in fanfic often.

Rape victims falling in love with their rapists - one of the reasons I just don't read anything with rape in.
