I agree that I'm tired of seeing this trope where everyone is obsessed with Ginny's virginity. I wonder if I didn't read so many fics about the couple, if such a plotline would rub be the wrong way as much.

Having said that, I can't lie and say I wouldn't mind if a story had Ginny having already lost her virginity when her and Harry get back together. Same with Harry. Obviously there would be nothing wrong with either Harry or Ginny not being each other's first, but they are certainly young enough where realistically they probably were each other's first. I don't like the idea of Ginny losing her virginity at 15 because most people who think it happened feel its because she wanted to show that she is an adult. I like to have a little more faith in Ginny.
