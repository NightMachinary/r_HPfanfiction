And this goes for both ways. You have fics where she's portrayed as a Mary-like figure with her overprotective brothers, and then there are lots of fics as well that specifically mention in what way Ginny has already had sex (and with who). There is very little middle ground.

There are even fics where she talks to Harry about her sex life, and this just goes to show that a lot of fanfiction is written by people who don't really know how relationships work. I'd rather not listen to my girlfriend's past lovers, thank you very much. (Granted, no one's the same, and in some relationships this isn't an issue at all.)
