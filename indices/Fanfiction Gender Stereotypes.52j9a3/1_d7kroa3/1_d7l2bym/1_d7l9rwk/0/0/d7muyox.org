True that, alas. Though honestly, personally I blame it at least to some degree on the whole separation of men and women and the stupid notion that a man and a woman cannot be involved without it being romance; because seriously, as bad as I am with emotional stuff I don't have any issues spending time with men as a friend (a woman speaking here, just to make that clear), but I see people treat each other as if they belonged to a different society altogether just because their sex differs, and then I see them try their hands at romance and end up with ... shallow ridiculousness.

Though, of course, many a romance fic are still written by people you could throw under a label of social rejects (regardless of whether it's their fault or the fault of their environment), just like many a smut fic are written by woefully-undereducated virgins, so that's that as far as stories go.
