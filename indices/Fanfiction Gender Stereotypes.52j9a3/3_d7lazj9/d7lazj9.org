I see a ton of fics with female characters who are useless as anything but a love interest, must always be worse than their male counterparts in every way besides the power of heart, and are pretty much interchangeable. -- Actually, they can usually manage makeup and dresses, and occasionally if Daphne Greengrass is the love interest she'll have competence in politics. It's as if femininity were almost entirely a replacement for a personality or skills. As if major characters normally can get four adjectives (following Milo Amastacia-Liadon's rule), five if they're special, and being a woman accounts for four of them.

There's also a huge tendency for female love interests to subsume their goals for male partners, which is infuriating. I read a fic where Hermione heard of a legendary artefact that essentially spells victory in everything you do. Her immediate thought was: I could give this to Harry! ...except she could use it for herself, with a goal of helping Harry to defeat Voldemort, and then continue to use it for her own goals. She's got ambitions, unlike Harry.

Another fic had Hermione thinking: "I love Harry, but it's nice to get recognition for my own accomplishments on occasion." Which is straight from bizarro world for me. Why would you /not/ get recognition for your own accomplishments? Why would a dude in your life be reason to eschew praise? Do you suddenly not deserve to be acknowledged because you have the hots for someone?

One of the saddest cases I've encountered was about Ginny Weasley. She had a rather awesome life, and a lot of the story was kind of slice of life. But there was a lot of low-level background misogyny, not as a problem to be addressed, just woven into the world. And at the end, it was revealed that all her choices were motivated by running away from Harry because he was dating someone else, instead of her own ambitions.
