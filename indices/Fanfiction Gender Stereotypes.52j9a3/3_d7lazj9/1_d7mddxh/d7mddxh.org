I do often get the sense that many fanfic writers --- male^{1} and female^{2} alike --- wish that Hermione Granger were less like Hermione Granger and more like Bella Swan.^{3}

--------------

^{1} --- usually Harmony 'shippers

^{2} --- usually Dramione or (young)Tomione 'shippers

^{3} --- For the record, I am not saying that there is anything inherently wrong with identifying with, liking the character of, and/or wanting to see more characters like Bella Swan; different strokes for different folks, and all that.
