Yeah, that stuck out to me at the time as well. I suppose it's not impossible, though very unhealthy, to have your actions dictated by an unrequited crush years later. The reason I stopped reading though was rather Ginny's complete shift in personality halfway through. I mean, she makes friends with a couple of OCs, who she's supposed to have been close to for years, then suddenly makes an abrupt U-turn and starts having massive, pointless arguments with them regardless of any previous character development. Sigh.

Anyway I agree with most of what you said, but re Hermione's "I love Harry, but it's nice to get recognition for my own accomplishments on occasion" - it could have been not because being in a relationship means she shouldn't get acknowledged, but because it's /Harry Potter/ she's in a relationship with. Next to him, anyone's achievements would get overshadowed. Without reading the fic though I can only speculate.
