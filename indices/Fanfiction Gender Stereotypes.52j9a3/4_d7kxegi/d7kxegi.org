  I've found in a good 80%(Not a hard statistic) of the Harry centric romances I've read Harry and the other fellas are portrayed as complete idiots in the field of women in general be it in the romantic department, the feelings department, sexually, even something as petty as gift giving. As a guy I find it vaguely insulting but thats not the point. Granted I know some guys who are just utterly clueless about all that crap, but its not like people are hugely complicated.

Harry would be one of those guys. Even JK writes him as being clueless and semi-socially retarded around girls who aren't Hermione or Ginny. While most fanfiction writers flanderize the ever-loving shit out of it and turn Harry into a pants-on-head spastic around girls, him being dumb about romance and sex is canon.

Side-note: Dope flair. Not every day you see an Irvine Welsh fan in the HP fandom.
