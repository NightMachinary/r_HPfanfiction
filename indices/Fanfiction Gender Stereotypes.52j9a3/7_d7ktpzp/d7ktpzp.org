With certain characters, I don't really consider it a stereotype or any form of discrimination against men. Specifically Harry and Ron, although more Ron. I really wouldn't put it past Ron to give Hermione a Quaffle for her birthday present. Harry is better, but it's clear from the disaster with Cho that he can be an idiot when it comes to girls in canon, so I usually take it as the author attempting to keep true to the characters. Harry's idiocy is often exaggerated, though, but I've always assumed the author just wasn't that good at characterisation or something.

Otherwise, I agree with Taure that it's lazy writing. With Harry!centric fics, you get very little male characters of the same age that are fleshed out in canon that aren't stupid (the only really fleshed out characters are Ron, Harry, maybe Neville and Draco towards the end?). So it usually falls on the author to flesh out and create well-rounded characters, which precious few are willing or able to do.

Although, I think perhaps, the lack of awareness when it comes to discriminating against men contributes. So many people think of how to empower women, they end up discriminating against men in an effort to do so, as well. I'll admit to falling into the trap of this type of thinking myself, though I think (and hope) I've been getting better recently.

Your theory on romcom influence is probably true, too. Popular culture often celebrates certain stereotypes of both men and women, and the more impressionable generation forms their ideals of what life is like through that.
