I can't see Ron giving Hermione a quaffle... He bought her perfume in canon... Which smelled awful. But is sort of the "boy likes girl" gift. Along with jewelry. So I can see him buying something like a bracelet... Only to find out that she doesn't wear bracelets. Or that turns her wrist green. Something with thought, but just not quite right.
