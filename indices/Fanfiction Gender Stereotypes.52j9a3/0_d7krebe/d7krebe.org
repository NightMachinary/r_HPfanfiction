As with all common tropes, it's just lazy writing. And since fanfiction writers tend to be even lazier than professional writers, you get a corresponding increase in reliance on clich√©s.

If you ditched the trope you might have to write characters as individuals with motivations and differing attitudes and knowledge. That sounds like a real chore. Far better to just use pre-made lowest common denominator archetypes.
