It'd be nice if the author put in enough effort to make the female character just as clueless though. Its that it's specifically the male love interest is always clueless.

Any thirteen year old romance is annoying, because thirteen year olds are annoying.

Never saw that one, heard it's one of the few non-terrible romcoms though.

Minor pedantic note: Its not secretly if hes sitting there listening to it.
