The stories are predominantly about teenagers and their first loves. Of course they're fucking clueless about females. Thirteen year old Don Juan!Harry is annoying af.

Secretly? Every woman i've ever met has complained at least thrice about how stupid their SO is, often when he's there to hear it.

Tvtropes, while a MILDLY useful tool, is written by people. People are fallible.

Romcom has DESTROYED romance. Though, admittedly, the scene in Love Actually where the best man tells Keira Knightley she's the most beautiful woman in the world I thought was actually a pretty good scene.
