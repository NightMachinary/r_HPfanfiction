Good explanation, but it does not explain why something like that isn't fixed/fought against (all that magic could for example be funneled into the wards or a trick stair could be disenchanted!) as it's still dangerous to the students (might not be convenient to have to rebuild your school every so hundred years, if you can't fight or prevent the accumulation of magic, but the safety of the students should be more important than that...-.-)
