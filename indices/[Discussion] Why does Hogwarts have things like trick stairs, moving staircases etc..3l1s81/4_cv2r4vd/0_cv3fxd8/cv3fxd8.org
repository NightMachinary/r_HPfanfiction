They would have the "grounding for NEWT-Potions" if Snape was teaching them - magicking a recipe on the blackboard and floating around the classroom like a big bat (and taking off points for "breating too loudly" and incorrect preparation of ingredients etc. (despite never having been shown how!)) is not teaching -.-

I mean I get that the guy is passionate about his subject, but how can incite other people's passion if you never explain a single thing? - IMHO you can't!

I agree that NEWT-Potions (and the NEWT itself) is probably important for a large number of career choices (from the Aurors to Healers and probably several others...I think magical paint requires knowledge of ingredients etc., too!), which makes it even worse if the teacher destroys the chances of a lot of students of ever working in those fields (unless they get a tutor and re-take the NEWT or something!)
