I agree (on the college readiness of students...don't know if that applicable here though) but Slughorn (who is a better potions professor (maybe not a better potioneer/brewer, but surely he's the better educator!)) didn't agree and his students didn't blow them selves up by the dozens (and it's not like he had to constantly correct mistakes etc.)
