You are completely missing the point I made with regards to OWLs. Like I said, "It might have been that the EE students weren't actually prepared for NEWTs and beyond, it's not exactly uncommon for standardized tests to incorrectly gauge the level of knowledge a student has." Think of it this way - any standardized test results in grades that represent the level of knowledge for the student. So let's say that an EE on your Potions OWL represents knowledge level A. Now, to do, "ok" in NEWT Potions, you might need knowledge level B - and when I say "ok," I mean average with a little bit of effort. For those of you familiar with the American grading system, think "C average." It is entirely possible that knowledge level A is below knowledge level B. Hell, an O on the Potions OWL may translate to knowledge level C which is still below knowledge level B but closer. That is what I mean when I say that the reasoning behind his standards probably isn't as black and white as it would seem. It's not uncommon for students that are stamped as "college-ready" to be anything but. I don't see that changing just because we've started including wands in the classes.
