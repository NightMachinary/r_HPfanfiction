I would assume that the castle having trick stairs, moving staircases, etc. would help engender the sense of magic and wonder, like others have said above. Not to mention that it doesn't seem out of place given the wizarding world. I mean, one of the entrances to the Ministry of Magic is through a toilet. I'm ok with moving staircases as the alternative.

I always have mixed feelings about Snape's class. Obviously the man can't teach, but in terms of his standards, I don't think it's as black and white as it would seem. The aurors had to take and pass NEWT potions - I'm guessing so would healers. There might be other careers that rely on potions knowledge, but well, thanks to Harry, we don't really know. So, these are high level careers that depend in part on sufficient knowledge. Slughorn may have taken more students into NEWTS, but how many of them really knew as much as they needed to to have a good grounding for NEWT classes? To succeed in their chosen career? It might have been that the EE students weren't actually prepared for NEWTs and beyond, it's not exactly uncommon for standardized tests to incorrectly gauge the level of knowledge a student has. As far as him being unhelpful in class, it really is difficult to gauge since Potions is for the most part fictional. Like I said, the man obviously can't teach. But I can't help but wonder if some of the stuff he expected students to know would be obvious and basic if students put in time outside of class. There is something to be said for expecting students to show some initiative rather than holding their hands throughout their education.
