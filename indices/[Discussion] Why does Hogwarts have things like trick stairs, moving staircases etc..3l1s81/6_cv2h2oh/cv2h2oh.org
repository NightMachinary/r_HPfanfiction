I think the danger of physical harm is taken much more lightly in the wizarding world because so many serious injuries can be easily healed by magic. I mean, there's a potion for growing new bones overnight! And the magic students haven't learned how to control yet seems a lot more dangerous to me than getting banged up physically (even after a NASTY fall down the stairs at Hogwarts, you can expect to be fine the next day). The castle is a possibly a bit sentient, oozing with magic, and has its own personality.

The blood purity stuff in the books offers a new perspective on things like sexism and racism and the way they work in society. People get treated like they're worth less over irrelevant things they were born with all the time, and maybe we should be thinking about it more.

Hogwarts has no tuition. [[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/622118373061709824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]] Education is paid for by the Ministry of Magic. The Weasleys are broke because there are a ton of them living on a single income, and I don't get the impression the Ministry pays Arthur very well (his office is pretty much a closet he shares with another guy and he doesn't have enough status to get a window in there).

I think part of what makes the books so great is that magic doesn't just make everything perfect- people are flawed, and society is complicated.
