Ok, I know wizards can fix some injuries pretty quickly - but you aren't spared the initial pain (broken bones hurt like hell...broke my right arm as a child (which no one noticed...hell, I could still use the arm, though it did hurt a little and then got worse) and couldn't sleep that night because of the pain -.-)) which is bad enough and should (and can be!) prevented (not doing so is neglect at best - abuse and child endangerment at worst!)
