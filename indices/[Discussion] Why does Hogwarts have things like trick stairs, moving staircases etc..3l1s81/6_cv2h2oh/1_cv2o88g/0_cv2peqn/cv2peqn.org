Maybe the Wizarding community feels that pain builds character... plenty of muggle doctors agree from what I've heard and sometimes felt!

Learning magic is dangerous. Gruesome mishaps are the norm, why worry about a broken arm here or there?

Edit: I broke my arm as a child too, so badly I almost needed surgery. I don't feel like that physical pain did any lasting psychological damage.
