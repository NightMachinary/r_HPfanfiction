Those doctors are assholes (not going to sugar coat it as IMHO any doctor who says that should look for another job -.-) as are all other people suggesting that :(

Mishaps, yes - but those aren't on purpose. Leaving a trap for anybody to step into (if you know exactly where it is) is like harming them yourself IMHO and should not be encouraged!

Well, it's going to cause lasting damage - if it happens constantly (makes you feel afraid!)! (it's like child abuse IMHO (must not be sexual, though that works like that as well, I was thinking about starvation and beatings!))
