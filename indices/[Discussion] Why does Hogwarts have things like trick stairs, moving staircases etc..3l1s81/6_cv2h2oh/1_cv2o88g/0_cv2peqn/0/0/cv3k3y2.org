Yeah, those doctors are. But it does seem like some people think of pain as no big deal.

I was imagining the trick staircases as not deliberately designed that way, but maybe an attribute the castle developed by accident (was hogwarts built when the school was founded, or was an already existing castle turned into a school?). I could imagine stuff happening as a result of the energy students unintentionally give off. Maybe the funny stairs are just one of those things the school means to fix but never gets around to?
