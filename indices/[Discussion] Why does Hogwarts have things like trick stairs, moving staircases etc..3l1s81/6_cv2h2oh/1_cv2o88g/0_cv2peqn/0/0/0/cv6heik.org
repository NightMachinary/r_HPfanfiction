Maybe - there's a lot of those things (maybe Dumbles is really overtaxed/overburdened/stretched to thin with the many positions he holds and with keeping an eye on Harry (could call it: Spying on Harry or: Keeping Harry down) and arranging for - stupid tests for him and for his neglect/abuse (we don't know if he was beaten etc.) by the Dursleys!)...same for the teachers (who IMHO have too many classes (if you teach from morning to late afternoon you don't get a lot done otherwise...especially if you are a head of house in addition to teaching and maybe are the Deputy Head as well -.-)

That's why I think Hogwarts needs to be "fixed" (not only the stairs, staircases etc. but classes, equipment (the outdated brooms for flying lessons come to mind!), teachers etc. as well!)
