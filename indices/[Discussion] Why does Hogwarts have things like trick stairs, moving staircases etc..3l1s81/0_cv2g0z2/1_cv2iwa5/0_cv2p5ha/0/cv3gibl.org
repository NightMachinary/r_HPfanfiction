Yeah, it is. Makes me kind of sad that JK didn't really do something about that, so that you couldn't come to such a conclusion...I mean come on, by fifth year Harry could have started being his own man instead of Dumbledore's sacrifice (I mean I myself would have stopped believing any word that old geezer said after learning he placed me with the Dursleys!)...and he isn't the only one, Hermione should have learned to accept being criticized (more so if she does something or talk about something if she doesn't have all the facts!) and Ronald is the worst...he should have grown up way earlier (his jealousy is off putting (particularly because Harry would trade EVERYTHING to switch places with him, which he knows!) - I'd have stopped being friends with that prat if I were in Harry's shoes!)
