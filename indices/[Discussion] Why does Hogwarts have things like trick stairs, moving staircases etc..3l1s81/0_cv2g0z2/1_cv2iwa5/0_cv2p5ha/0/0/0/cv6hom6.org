Why is it "reaching", if I say that believing in your abuser (which is exactly what Dumbles was, if indirectly: He sent Harry there after all!)

Same for Harry's friends...He has enough reasons to tell Ron where to stick it (same for Hermione with her - useless - crusades, which help no one, snobbery (she's a bad as Malfoy, he is a pureblood and thinks Muggles and Muggleborns are vermin, while she thinks wizards are stuck in the dark ages (sure: on some level I agree, but some things are a certain way for good reason, which she doesn't give a shit about if it offends her sensibilities and muggle upbringing (houselfs!)) and bossyness (she's not Harry's and Ron's mother, so when (or whether!) they do their homework is non of her business!)...I seem to remember that she didn't believe him at first in GoF as well, though at least she didn't abandon him - like a certain redhead!)

ps: Call me cold, but I can understand Ron on some level as I grew up with rich friends (had two kids of millionaires in my classes and I've been shopping with one and I've been at his house!) and sometimes I would have loved to trade my loving parents (dad and stepmother...wouldn't miss my biological mother and I admit that I'd exchange her for a lot of cash in a heartbeat (particularly because she stole a not too small sum of money from me!)) for his cold and absent ones (sure, they were alive but IMHO it's almost as bad as wishing you were loaded - even if it came at the cost of your parent's lives!)
