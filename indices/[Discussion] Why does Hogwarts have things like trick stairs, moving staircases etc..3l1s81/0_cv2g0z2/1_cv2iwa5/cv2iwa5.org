Well, law (within reason) is taught at certain schools in Germany (no, not universities, schools!)...basic things like contracts (and the terminology to go with it) and such (no criminal law and no really complicated cases either)

ps: Don't get me started on the heroes...I stick around in the HP-Fandom because of the universe itself, most of the people there disgust me (including Ron (useless slacker!), Hermione (bookish know it all who can't accept being wrong, even if it only happens once in a while -.- and thinks she's better than anybody else) and Harry (the clueless/brainless boy stuff just happens to and who gets by on luck, chance and the sacrifice (sometimes literally) of others -.-) who's unable to make use of everything given to him (hell, his patronus shows he's got some power, but he never uses it...same for the DA, he's got leadership ability but does not do anything with it -.-))

Note: I'll do a full commentary on your posting later, I am in a hurry ATM -.-

ps: Nice downvoting - just because I state an opinion you guys probably don't agree with -.-
