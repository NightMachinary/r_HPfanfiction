I imagine the original idea for the trick steps, etc. was partly to give Hogwarts a sense of strangeness and to showcase it as a place of magic and wonder. It was also (I think) to provide a sort of commentary on British boarding schools having obscure traditions that make no sense to outsiders.

I always assumed the moving staircases were a way of getting from one side of the castle to the other without having to walk the entire way, with some kind of spell to prevent people or belongings falling off. I assume the doors that lead to different places at different times serve a similar purpose. These two also provide examples of things you "just have to know", such as which door leads where at what time, and which staircase moves from which area of the castle to which area of the castle. The idea of the trick steps is a prime example of the theory that these things represent obscure traditions, being something that serves no purpose, is something you "just have to know about" and inconveniences you if you're not careful.

I'm not really addressing your main point with these, but a few things:

#+begin_quote
  no football/soccer?
#+end_quote

It would extremely difficult to introduce non-traditional sports into real life schools with the kind of history Hogwarts has, let alone introducing a sport that is completely alien to the magical culture.

#+begin_quote
  private boarding school that costs a pretty penny
#+end_quote

Hogwarts is a state school; there are no fees. Incidentally, this is also why the Ministry was able to influence such control over it in /Order of the Phoenix/.

#+begin_quote
  Why didn't they ... leave[?]
#+end_quote

Because organising the mass exodus of every single muggleborn in the UK and Ireland would be completely impossible.

#+begin_quote
  they are harming the next generation, too if they don't demand more/equal rights
#+end_quote

When was it ever shown, or even implied that muggleborns have less civil rights than other witches or wizards? There's prejudice, sure, but that's shown to be in the minority, and, in any case, it is a social issue.

#+begin_quote
  living in the past ... without being able to adapt
#+end_quote

The reason quills and parchment are used as opposed to pens and paper is that Rowling wanted her magical world to resemble the stereotypical, faux Middle Ages, storybook idea of what witches and wizards are, hence the robes, cloaks, pointed hats, broomsticks, etc. The actual in-universe reason, however, is simple. The existence of magic. One can make a compelling argument for why almost anything could be true given the existence of magic, especially the loose, intention based magic of Harry Potter. You say that the magical world is "unable to adapt", but we really get no indication of:

a) How long the wizarding world has had this technology for

b) How effective it is compared to its contemporary muggle counterparts, or

c) How much magic has advanced compared to how much muggle technology has advanced over a comparable period of time.

Without having this information, we can't really say that the magical world is any less adaptable than the muggle world. After all, a major part of the series is that it draws parallels between the two worlds, and shows that they're not that different at the core.

#+begin_quote
  they never get taught the customs of their new world
#+end_quote

Are there really any customs that muggleborn students would need to know about? From what we see at Hogwarts, the magical world celebrates Christian holidays. Outside of Hogwarts, a lot of culture seems to be shared with muggle culture. The issue of law and history would probably be the main areas of difference, but there is a history class (however incompetently taught), and law isn't taught in muggle schools at that age either.

#+begin_quote
  Snape should have been out of a job
#+end_quote

This is absolutely true. Snape, as well as Binns, should have been out their ears long before the books take place. However, due to Harry Potter originally having been written as a children's book, not an enormous amount of thought was spent on verisimilitude. Hence, the stereotype of the boring history teacher overblown to enormous proportions. Snape was there to provide a red herring in Philosopher's Stone, and to play the role of someone who was on the same side as the heroes, but personally disliked them. Of course, we don't know how long Binns had been teaching for, so it's possible that there's nobody else qualified to teach history, as the previous few generations have had him as a teacher. Regarding Snape, we know that Dumbledore kept him on staff due to personal reasons.
