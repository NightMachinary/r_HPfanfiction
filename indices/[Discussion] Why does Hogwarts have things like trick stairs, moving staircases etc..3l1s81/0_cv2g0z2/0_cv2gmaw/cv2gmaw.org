Wow, I never thought out it this way. It's still nice to see other theories that make sense. Thanks for the post!

The way I've always thought - since that Statue of Secrecy in 1692, the magical world has sort of forgotten to keep up with the Muggle world. Firstly, they don't need new inventions for convenience since everything is already convenient, secondly, they might not realize new inventions exist. They like radios, but tvs never caught on, they use cars occassionally, but they are still considered a "muggle thing", computers and internet don't seem as important when you can instantly appear anywhere in the world you want to talk to someone or go to a library. Not to say these things couldn't be /useful/ to wizards, but they probably live in ignorance of the convenience because they don't /really/ need to innovate because they already have so many conveniences due to magic.
