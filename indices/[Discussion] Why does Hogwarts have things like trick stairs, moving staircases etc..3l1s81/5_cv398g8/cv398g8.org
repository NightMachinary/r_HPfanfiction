The stairs provide atmosphere. My (very fancy) high school had marble staircases. They are beautiful. They are also completely and utterly treacherous when wet, like after a fire drill. The wizarding world seems much less concerned with safety than schools in real life, so the school's quirks seem completely reasonable to me.

Also, no muggleborn is going to complain too much about learning how to use /magic/ at first. They're not going to take it for granted that way. They might object more later, but probably only if employment prospects are bleak. Otherwise, people tend to prefer to keep their heads down.
