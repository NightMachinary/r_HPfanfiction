What the fuck? - Why would anything be wet after a DRILL (as in: a simulated fire...well, simulated fire escape (I've never seen a drill were real water is used...))?

Sure, my catholic school had marble staircases (in the old monastery building where certain classes where being held), too but they were only wet (because of being cleaned) after the final bell for the day (when the students weren't there anymore)

Yeah, sadly enough you are right: People keep their heads down most of the time sadly - until whatever they are complaining about becomes truly unbearable (like ATM with the surveillance...it's getting worse every day but nobody is taking action sadly enough) and violence seems to be the only answer :(
