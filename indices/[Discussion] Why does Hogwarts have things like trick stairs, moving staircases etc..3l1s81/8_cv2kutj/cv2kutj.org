Because that's the entire premise of the series. Magic is wacky and chaotic and illogical. This is not the muggle world where everything is cardboard-cut and committee-approved and designed for maximal practicality and equality and straight angles and BOREDOM. If the muggleborns don't like it, they can go back to their perfectly normal muggle world and have tea with Petunia Dursley. Also, Hogwarts is hardly the only school that has terrible, bullying teachers. Mine certainly had despite being considered high quality.
