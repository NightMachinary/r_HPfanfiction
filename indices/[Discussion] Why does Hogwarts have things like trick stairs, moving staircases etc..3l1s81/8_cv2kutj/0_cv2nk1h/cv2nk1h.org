It's not totally chaotic - sure it's a little wild at times, but a scientific mindset/scientific method does help when it comes to magic, sure it can not fully explain everything, but it's not totally wasted either (hell, they have a class - though it's an elective - for that: Arithmancy (in addition to runes, which are also kind of logical and straight forward!))

Mine did, too and it was considered (still is, sadly enough...I thought opinions would change, as the school wasn't well liked by most of the students after all) pretty high quality, too (private catholic school run by a monastery (the only monk was the headmaster though (who taught Latin and Religious-Studies) - was, as he's dead now and now no teacher there is a monk))...still, I think bullying is not acceptable at all and bullies should be punished as harshly as possible (and people enabling them - like say Snape, Dumbledore (and all the other teachers...I mean calling somebody a "mudblood" or even a "mudblood whore" isn't ok, but no one did something about it!) - should be punished even more harshly (probation, losing their job etc.))

ps: What you are saying sounds like something Draco Malfoy (or Lucius) or even Voldy would say -.- (have you been taking "How to be the perfect pureblood?" lessons? :D)
