Part 2: Biases and options

Muggleborns have nothing to compare Hogwarts to; if there are smaller schools, they won't have as large of a staff and can't therefore offer as wide a selection of courses.

Complaints by parents to the school administrators would be answered as politely as you can imagine, but the end result is still 'where else are you going to go?' What's more, there seems to be no tuition for Hogwarts as it's supported by the Ministry (almost like a safety measure if you accept the idea I mentioned in my first post), so a muggleborn having to take their child out, find a smaller school or a Master willing to take an apprentice and then buy enough gold to trade for Galleons to pay them might seem prohibitively expensive. The Finch-Fletchlys might be able to afford it but they already were pointing Justin at Eton.
