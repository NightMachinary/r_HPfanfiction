Another key thing to remember is that Hogwarts was around far before the Ministry of Magic. So while it may be supported financially by the Ministry, by the time they came around the school's structure was already in place.

In terms of governance, we see in OOtP that the Ministry does have the power to make orders concerning the school, with the so-called Educational Decrees, but that that is unusual. In that regard, it is more like a private school.
