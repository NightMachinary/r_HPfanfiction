Tuition for Hogwarts is a topic of fanon or apocrypha- either you believe there is tuition and the Weasleys are getting a group rate or you accept JKR's out-of-editorial-control assertion that there isn't, and the only reason the Weasleys are poor is from cost of food and supplies.

Whether the Ministry subsidizes the school on the basis of it being a safety measure (isolating accidental magic to save lives and to protect Secrecy) doesn't mean the Ministry has direct control over it- that's why there's a Board of Governors- an organization that is canon, as Lucius was on it, had bullied the other board members to oust Dumbledore in Harry's second year and afterwards lost his position on it when Albus was proven correct that none of the students would be killed.
