A. Because it's funny

B. An in-universe explanation might follow this reasoning: Hogwarts as a school was set up to train young magicians in controlling their access to magic. During these formative years, accidental magic becomes more likely and more dangerous, so moving them out to an isolated location was key. The castle is meant to absorb the excess impulse-based magic, leading to all sorts of unintended side-effects, like moving staircases, benign intelligent Giant squids and a personification of pre-adolescent chaos know as 'Peeves'. The castle is still considered a 'safe' proving ground because the challenges presented by the castle give young wizards and witches reasons to use and leverage their magic.

I have a secondary theory that the Founders arranged for a particular protection: anyone coming to the school as a student cannot die within its walls. The exceptions to this Great charm are from equally Great magic: ancient creatures or other powers that pre-date the Founders.

Just thinking about it, I could see the Sorting Hat as being the avenue of delivery for the protection- once a student is Sorted, they come under the protection of a Founder.
