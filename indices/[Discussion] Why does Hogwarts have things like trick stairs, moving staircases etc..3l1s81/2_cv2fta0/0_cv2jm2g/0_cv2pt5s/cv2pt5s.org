The Battle of Hogwarts started with Voldemort breaking the protections on the castle in order for his forces to assault it. He came to do murder and used his considerable power to supersede that protection.

Myrtle was killed by the Basilisk, one of those Great magics that could overcome the protection. In fact, as my theory is only that, I'd have to say that Dumbledore believes that the castle offers this protection, but he hasn't told anyone else about it or can't prove it for certain. Perhaps it's one of those special situations where the magic only works if it's kept a secret- told to the Headmasters as part of their induction but not made clear how it functions or what the limits may be.

Albus and Barty Crouch Sr. were not students when they died, though, so that part of the theory still works.

I have a variant theory that Dumbledore himself created a protective charm to ensure the survival of all students after seeing Myrtle's unfortunate end when he was only Professor of Transfiguration, and that this protection disappeared after he died. That's not quite as cool to me, though.
