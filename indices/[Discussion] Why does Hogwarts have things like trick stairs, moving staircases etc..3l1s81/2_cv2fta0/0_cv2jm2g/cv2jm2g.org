Well, didn't the battle of Hogwarts disproof that (some people died right there and not all of them were ex-students, were they?...I admit, I've never read it, as I just couldn't stomach it, Rowling takes her "hero" apart too much for my liking, while presenting Hermione as omniscient -.-)? Or the assisted suicide of Dumbledore? Or the basilisk killing Myrtle?

The theory of Peeves being the personification of the minds of teens is great though :)
