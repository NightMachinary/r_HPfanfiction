The problem with saying 'it wouldn't work' is that it doesn't make a very long fic. Professor blows up the mysterious monster centaur with a blasting curse, the end.

Also, the man-eating spiders keep to themselves, magic resistance is a thing in the Harry Potter verse (see trolls, giants, and dragons), and hitting the lynel with an arrow/spell/sword would require not getting toasted by a fireball or magic arrow first, and getting it through the lynel's shield (assuming it has one) and their hide. Which in turn raises the question of 'in a crossover, should Zelda monsters be stronger than Harry Potter creatures/magic?'

Actually, now I wonder. Given that house-elves can pop around Hogwarts even without Apparation being possible there, could a Lynel use their teleportation around Hogwarts as well?

Also, question for you; would you prefer to talk about a story with X Harry Potter Character being in the Zelda: Breath of the Wild world?
