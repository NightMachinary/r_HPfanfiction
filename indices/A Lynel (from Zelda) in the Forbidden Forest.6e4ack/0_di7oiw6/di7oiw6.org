There are giant, man-eating spiders in the forbidden forest and everyone is fine with those things.

I think you're drastically overestimating the actual effect this would have. For one thing, the centaurs know the Forbidden Forest. They've lived there for as long as anyone knows, so they have the home turf advantage. Lynels are fast, sure, but having cover alone makes them magnitudes less dangerous.

So, your final questions in order: No. There are man-eating spiders in the forbidden forest and no one gives a damn.

Maybe? But the centaurs could probably deal with it easily.

No. That's not his style. He only uses things he can control or negotiate with, like the Dementors and Giants and Werewolves, not wild beasts.

Possibly not, but there are a number of other methods that would work just fine. The Sword of Gryffindor definitely, an arrow dipped in basilisk venom, or possibly one of a number of poisons.

But really? A wizard could deal with it easily. Conjunctivitis curse, transfiguration, the blasting curse, Sectumsempra. McGonagall could animate the Hogwarts statues against it. So no. A lynel isn't a threat to Hogwarts.
