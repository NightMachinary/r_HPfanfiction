I really enjoy both, Drarry being the first fanfiction I accidentally stumbled upon back in the day. But now if I had to choose I would pick Dramione, because I really do feel it wasn't outside the realm of possibility if Draco had been given a redemption arc like many feel he deserved. He also seemed like someone that would value Hermione's intelligence and quirks rather than be annoyed by them since he was also quite intelligent. It would be the ultimate proof of his being redeemed as well both in his beliefs and making right the bullying he did in the past by altering the status quo. I have a lot of feelings on this topic, clearly. XD
