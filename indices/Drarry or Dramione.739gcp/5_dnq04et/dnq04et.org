From a plausibility standpoint, Dramione.

Ignoring the canon sexual orientations of the characters concerned, Draco and Harry are enemies because Draco reminds Harry of Dudley, a spoiled bully. That's not a basis for sexual chemistry.

It's not like there's a lot to attract Hermione to Draco, either, but she has been shown to be more open than Harry to going out with someone she dislikes (McLaggen), and at the beginning of Book Two when we overhear Draco's conversation with his father, it sounds as if Draco has been bringing up Hermione all summer.
