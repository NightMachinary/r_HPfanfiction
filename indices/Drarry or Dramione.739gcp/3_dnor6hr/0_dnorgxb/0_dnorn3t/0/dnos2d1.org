I'll agree to that to a degree its true that he picked on Harry too but it was more out of jealousy and pettyness which doesn't make it better but there is less uncomfortableness to get past since he at least still saw Harry as a equal a rival. While he saw Hermione is as something beneath him because of what she was. I am all about kids who grew up with bigoted parents learning that those bigoted views are wrong and getting past them but it seems uncomfortable when the victim of their bigotry has to get them past it before starting a relationship. Dramione i prefer in AUs where Draco was never a bigot or one of those years after the war ones where hes gotten past alot of his issues.
