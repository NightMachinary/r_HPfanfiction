Drarry. Draco is so racist that I can't see Hermione being with him unless he's totally different or if she has no self respect. Harry, however, wasn't really on the receiving end of his racism. I've seen it happen in real life, where someone is fine dating someone else who was racist to one of their friends because witnessing racism isn't the same as experiencing it. On the other hand, unless the person who is a minority has terrible self esteem and some major self loathing going on, they're not likely to date someone so blatantly racist to them.
