Linkffn(Fantastic Elves and where to find them)

Harry/Draco friendship, although very frustrating for Draco since Harry lives in the forest instead of the Slytherin dorms. Hermione gets mad at him for freeing the elves and making all her work unnecessary. You-Know-Who confusion.

Linkffn(When in doubt, Obliviate)

Featuring a Lockhart who is slightly more competent than canon, but still not exactly the hero type.

Linkffn(The many Deaths of Harry Potter)

Pragmatic survivalist Harry.

"Harry, why are you practicing cutting curses?"

"Maybe If I get good at it I could use it to cut someone's arm off."

Linkffn(3 Slytherin Marauders)

Riding dragons and befriending Malfoy and Dudley. And Tonks gets a shock when her date turns out to be Voldemort.
