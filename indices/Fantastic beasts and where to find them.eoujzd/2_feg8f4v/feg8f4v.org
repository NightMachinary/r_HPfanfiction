It's complicated. They are certainly part of HP fandom, but a way interesting question is whether the films are considered canonical. And that's very complicated.

The whole premise that Grindelwald existed and probably the main story points are canonical (especially, when they are confirmed from other canonical sources).

There are many things which are discovery in the films (especially the first one), which explain things unknown previously. For example, with discussion about Obscurials, we most likely finally learned what had actually happened to Ariana Dumbledore. There are many magozoological details we have never learned before, which we know now.

On the other hand, the carelessness with which JKR approached many details of magic (I guess, mostly for cinematographic reasons, there is suddenly much more wandless magic, for example) and the way with which she contradicted her own books (e.g., curious case of ageing of Minerva McGonagall is just the most famous one), makes the films very unreliable source of the canonical information.
