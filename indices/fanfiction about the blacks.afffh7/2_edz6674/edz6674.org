I can offer you a fic about the Tonks family (and an adopted Harry) from 1994 onwards. Mostly the Tonks family, with frequent mentions of Bellatrix and Narcissa. There are mentions of house politics, but nowhere near the average "political" fic and the amount of power the Blacks wield is significantly lower as well. Lots of family fluff.
