So I decided to read this book even though it's not my typical go-to genre of fics.

I agree with most of what others have written about the pacing being off at times and some other issues but overall felt the story was good and kept me engaged.

My biggest gripe, and probably why I won't read the sequels, is that the story just seemed to take us from one action sequence to the next without establishing a clear story. I didn't ever really understand why each sequence was necessary. Harry takes the other three to all these dangerous locations and it is never clear why.

In most action movies, there is a romantic b-plot to the main story. There is a reason they do this, so that the audience can catch it's breath and also see the characters as more human. This story never seemed to want to catch its breath. I'm not saying it needed to have a Harry/Ginny romance subplot (though it seemed to be there for the taking and would have definitely improved the pacing) but the story needed something instead of 100 action scenes.

If someone could let me know if the sequels decide to take that advice, let me know and I'd be happy to read further.
