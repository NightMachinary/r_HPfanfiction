There's no Romance, so while the pairing would be Harry/Ginny, that's not the focus of the story at all (the story starts off with Harry having disappeared, and Ginny is trying to find clues to his whereabouts, clues that no one wants her to find). Very little slice of life, and most of the story takes place in various locations around the world, trying to unravel the spiderweb of mysteries that are present and to figure out who the enemy actually is.
