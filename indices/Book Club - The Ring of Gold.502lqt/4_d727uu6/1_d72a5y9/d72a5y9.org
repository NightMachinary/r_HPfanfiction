I think it was started before DH, so the twins survive intact, but otherwise there is little impact as a result. Mainly an action/suspense epic with a well-developed world which overlaps with the canon localities a little. It's well written, maybe go for the first 5 chapters to see if you get hooked, I think that should be far enough to introduce most of the major players and the plot-line.

It's not predominantly a romance.
