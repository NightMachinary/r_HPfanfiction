I finished reading the whole thing. My previous comments still apply. The actions scenes are confusing and waaaaaaaay too long. The ending is a good setup for the sequel, but that's one of the few redeeming qualities of this fic. The two chapters that took place in the Department of Mysteries were possibly the most boring part of the story. Each was incredibly long and in each there was one interesting thing that happened. All of this could have been handled much better. I think the overblown wordcount is the fic's greatest flaw. If it were 60k words shorter, it would be a much better paced story and there is more than enough unnecessary stuff to cut away. It's not the worst fanfic I've ever read, not the best, but the last few chapters dragged the climax out too much and I found myself skimming a lot. It's not a bad fanfic, but it stands no higher than average.

There clearly was a plan for this, but just the existance of a plan doesn't mean everything was automatically well done. The author had some points they wanted to reach, but between those points there was a lot of flailing and too many words. I'm not feeling at all inclined to read the sequel.
