After voraciously reading through the entire trilogy over the last week, I'm left with some pretty big questions. There are some large plot holes once you reach the end, which I'd hoped the author would have made a blog or something to answer questions, but honestly I haven't tried that hard to find it. I think overall I'd rate it a 4/5. The point coming from the plot holes.

Edit: also Bungle in the Jungle is probably my favorite fanfic, only slightly edging out Ginny's Gift and The Long Road Home from the pre-OoTP days.
