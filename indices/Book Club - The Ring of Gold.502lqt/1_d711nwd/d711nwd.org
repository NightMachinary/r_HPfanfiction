I first read this story (and the trilogy as a whole) about 7-8 years ago, and have reread it twice since (most recent being earlier this year). I have yet to encounter any other stories that are built in the same way this one is. There's a lot of nice world building, and a lot of mystery which actually builds a lot of suspense, since the answers are not as obvious as they appear, even at the conclusion of the first story.

The story is not without flaws. I wouldn't rate it as an A+, but it is very good, and I personally feel like it is one of very few stories from 10+ years ago that has actually held up well. Sure, the pacing is all over the place at times, and the first chunk of the story is written from Ginny's PoV, but the story gets truly epic in scale, with enough twists to keep you on your toes.

It's a shame that stories like Wastelands of Time and Bungle in the Jungle tend to overshadow this story, but I feel like this story is very underrated, and I have gone out of my way to sing its praises and bring attention to it. I can't recommend it enough.
