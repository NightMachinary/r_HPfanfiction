I'm halfway through, thought I'd share my impressions so far.

Firstly, I must say that for such an old fanfic, it's aged phenomenally. If it was 2005 me reading it, it'd be an instant masterpiece. Even compared to a lot of recent fanfics, it comes out the victor, that's more of a statement on the fandom than this particular fic.

I was drawn in by Anarchy's recommendation and the mysteries have kept me reading. It becomes obvious fairly quickly that this has been pretty meticulously plotted and it lends the fic a sense of cohesiveness. Characters aren't half bad either. Ginny is pretty well done, though nothing about her screams to me "what a great character!". She works and I suppose that's fine. I was pleasantly surprised by some of the OCs, like Ginny's boss and Grigore Tarus. With a little work in some scenes, the author advanced them into characters with depth.

However, Ring of Gold isn't without problems. The prose, while I thought there were some pretty good moments, is generally average. Not bad as much as very utilitarian - it gets me from scene to scene, but I'm not wowed and I find it kind challenging to read at times. Some scenes I just wanted to get through.

The pacing drags sometimes. There are bits that are glossed over to quickly and some where the pace was bogged down in unnecessary detail, like the very first chapter.

For all the places Ginny visits, I feel like they're wasted opportunities. The chapter that takes place in Egypt could've been set in any urban area. I was told it was Egypt, but I wasn't shown anything interesting. Same goes for the castle in Germany. The town in Romania was much better handled in that regard.

Lastly, I must say the author doesn't write action well. In many action scenes I felt lost because the in-scene geography (or lack of it) made it difficult to imagine it and as such difficult for me to enjoy. They drag on too long and Ginny is a boring character to follow through an action scene. There's plenty of running, but running does not an action scene make. Well, it can, but there's enough of it here that it drags everything else down. The battle in the Ministry in the first chapter suffered from too much description and I can't recall a single thing that Ginny has done in a fight that really grabbed my attention.

I'll post again in a few days, after I finish reading.
