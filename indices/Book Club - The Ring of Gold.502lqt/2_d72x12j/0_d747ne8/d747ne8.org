I have finished the whole trilogy.

Jesus goddamn Christ on a Bike. All of you, go read this. GO READ IT NOW.

While some of the pacing is off, that is probably what I would call the most major flaw. Another would probably be every character's (except for Ron's) incredible hard-on for keeping secret things that honestly don't need to, but it is in line with how Ring of Gold starts. But really, go read this.

I will give two hints as to why certain things in Ring of Gold are important even though it is never answered in Ring of Gold. The first:

#+begin_quote
  "Which came first, the phoenix, or the flame?"

  "A circle has no beginning."
