  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner.

  Time turners are dangerous devices, and awful things happen to wizards and witches who meddle with time.Or do they?For Hermione Granger, an accident that leads her back in time changes the course of nearly a dozen lives, her own included. Love where there was none before, hope where it was lost, trust where it had always been suspect.A young Gryffindor girl that wouldn't have existed before.For Aurora Snape, starting school when the threat against Muggleborns and the chamber of secrets makes it more difficult to be the Potion's Master daughter. Or making Draco see that perhaps his perception of Muggleborns was wrong. And it certainly doesn't help when one of the few Gryffindors who are nice to her is the one person who really shouldn't know her too well: her mother.

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...
