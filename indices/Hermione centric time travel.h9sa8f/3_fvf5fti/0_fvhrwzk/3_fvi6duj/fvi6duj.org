Over It Over Again: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2484095]]\\
This is kind of time travel, kind of not. The author has some great Hermione-centric crossovers.

Consequence of the Past is a favourite: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1122594]]\\
A time turner with a sad ending for *JPHG*.

Another favourite, Things That Were, Things That Are: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/500891]]\\
It's a time travel where Hermione takes Lily's place
