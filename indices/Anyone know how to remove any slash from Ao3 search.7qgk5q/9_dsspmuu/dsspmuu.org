The longer you stay on AO3 the more you'll be desensitized to it. Soon a year will have passed and all you're reading is m/m or f/f and it won't even phase you, because it's normal on that site. Tbh, if you call m/m pairings slash, it's probably best to stay on ff.net.

edit: oh and any fic with rape will have a bolded warning on the top of the tags, so it's easy to scroll past if that's not what you want to read
