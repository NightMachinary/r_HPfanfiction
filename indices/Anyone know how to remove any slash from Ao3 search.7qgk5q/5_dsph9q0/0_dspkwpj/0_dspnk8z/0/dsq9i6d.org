Yeah some pairings are just weird or even disgusting to think about. Sirius/Hermione might work when she's 20 something not when she's 14 and fucking him in a broom closet. Even then the age gap just seems to big for me to understand how it would work. Slash I just can't handle, I don't know if it makes me homophobic or not but I simply can't enjoy a fic if it has slash no matter how amazing the plot may be. I'm sure I'm Snapephobic since I literally can't force myself to read a fic where Snape is paired with anyone.
