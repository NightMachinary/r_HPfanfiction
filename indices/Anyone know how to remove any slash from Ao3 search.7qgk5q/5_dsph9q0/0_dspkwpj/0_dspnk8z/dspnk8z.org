Yeah, but those are a lot rarer. Most involve time travel, i.e one of the girls travels back in time to when James/Sirius/Remus were in Hogwarts. There are some straight pedo pairings like Hermione Sirius or Hermione Remus, and those are similarly fucked up. Of course, all of this is not counting other fandoms crossing over.
