Bites the Dust is a creature that hides in someone. It has a trigger word, like a secret. If the host reveals the secret, BTD attacks and explodes everyone who heard it, then rewinds time for 1 hour. Everyone killed in a previous rewind by BTD will die in all others. BTD also protects its host against harm. The only way to defeat BTD is to defeat the one who released it. BTD may only have one host at a time.
