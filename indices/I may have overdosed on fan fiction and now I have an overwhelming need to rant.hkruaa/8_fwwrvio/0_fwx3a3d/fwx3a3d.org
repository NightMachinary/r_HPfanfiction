The Changeling was definitely the final nail in the coffin for me in not feeling like canon was morally complex enough. That ending of the four houses coming together, valuing each others skills, depending on each other - gives me chills just thinking about it! This was the founders dream which they had not managed to fulfil, and at last the students outgrew their teachers. THAT's what I want from canon, not just discarding the Slytherins as the bad house. Like, okay, cool, if you really want to have such a simple world view where all the good people and bad people can be known from their name and their school house, then sure.... but so many fanfics show how you can do so much more in showing that people are not predestined to be horrible, that they can make different choices especially if people believe in them enough to give them that opportunity.

I'm not out to defend all the comically evil characters jkr stuffed in Slytherin, I'm here to congratulate all the fanfics that dare to go beyond the assumptions of canon and provide "the bad house" with a humanity it was never granted. When people do that the original story becomes richer, more human, wiser. The heroes actually have to grow, their world view actually has to expand. Instead... Harry and all his good guy Gryffindor friends (and acceptable company) were just always right all along about absolutely everything, and the baddies were just that - baddies with no personality beyond being bad.

This is of course not to crap on JKR amazing villains, nor to suggest all those villains deserved/needed a redemption ark. Not at all! But Changeling is such a fantastic example of how much canon could have gained from daring to give Slytherin a chance.
