Omg this this this!!! I read the Changeling and it like completely changed my view, like it completed the hp series better than what jkr did. And I feel like you hit the nail on the head when you said that the main characters are not forced to confront their own views. Like it's generally accepted that they are right. And that's why having Ginny in slytherin felt so right when I was reading the fic because it brought a heavy counterpoint to the gryffindor goodness.

And also I feel you on the issue where there's no attempt made to combat the prejudices and mindsets that was so detrimental to the wizarding world. The only attempt was just Harry naming his son after Snape and that's it... yeah Harry defeated Voldemort but was there any action taken to make sure no new Voldemorts are created? To make sure no student gets bullied or made fun of no matter what the reason? The really stupid gryffindor vs slytherin rivalry? I really wanted to see that change in the wizarding world honestly but I guess jkr got tired of writing I guess lmaoo it's understandable
