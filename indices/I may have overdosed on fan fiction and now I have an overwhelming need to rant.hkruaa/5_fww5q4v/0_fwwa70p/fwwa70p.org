And THIS is why I love fanfiction. Haphne is a fandom I've never got into (but maybe I should!) but I love how fanfiction is able to open a world of possibilities that just aren't available in canon. I treasure reading about the goodness and redemption possible outside the mainstream route to the point I've found certain fanfics more relatable than canon. I'll definitely be checking that sub out! :)
