How can genocide and war crimes be considered anything else?

  Similarly, the good Slytherin

The only good Slytherin was Andromeda, and she was the odd misfit. She is the only Slytherin who voluntarily was on the good side. You can make a case for Slughorn, but he did not mention the Horcruxes, and thereby directly helped Voldemort.

Snape voluntarily joined the magical Nazis and happily sold a family out for murder before becoming a thoroughly abusive teacher. And no, it was in no way necessary as a ruse or whatever else his apologists may claim, if anything, not acting all "good" is an insult to Dumbledore's intelligence or Voldemort's, depending on who is buying it.

Regulus had no issues with the genocide either, he only minded the treatment of his elf (who, by modern standards, was a slave).

And while you can't pin more than housing Voldemort on Narcissa (she could have sold him out after getting her family out), she isn't good either, her one good moment is out of interest for her son, not because opposing Voldemort is the right thing.

  They're children! Was there really nooooo way to contrive of a character Harry could have even a small connection to in Slytherin?

Considering that Malfoy called for racial purges at age 12 and no one as much as blinked, I think that expecting true goodness is too much.

  Chuck Hermione with the snakes and she gets an opportunity to really push herself outside of the safety of being Harry and Ron's minders

Throw Hermione in there and she will likely end up dead before her time at Hogwarts is over. See the general support for purging all Muggleborn above.

  did Harry really learn to love his enemy

You don't love a genocidal movement, you purge it with extreme violence until it is in ruins. The reason Naziism died out in Germany were three years of constant bombardment and some 10 million Russians steamrolling Eastern Europe in 44/45. If you don't finish it decisively, you are setting yourself up for a repeat two decades down the road.

And HP canon was completely unsatisfactory in that regard. Malfoy not in prison for life, Snape considered a hero, no reckoning for Umbridge or the like... Sure, all was well...

I would love a good Slytherin fic, one which depicts it as the racist cesspool it is, the breeding ground for Voldemort and his movement (the only confirmed non-Slytherin Death Eater joined because he was a coward, not out of conviction).
