If it were that easy, it'd happen a bit more often. In the 1970s, there was a literal civil war going on outside Hogwarts; yet inside Hogwarts, schoolyard rivalries stayed schoolyard rivalries rather than escalate into lethal gang warfare.

Magic provides more ways to commit and conceal a crime, but it also provides more ways to investigate one, and in the end, it's a wash: the difficulty of getting away with a murder in Hogwarts is comparable to getting away with it in a Muggle boarding school.

Riddle was a genius who had tools at his disposal that nobody could even imagine at the time, a well as a convenient patsy. He had also been able to charm Dippett, but there is a good chance that Headmaster Dumbledore would have dug deeper and caught him anyway. Ultimately, anyone smart enough to have a good chance of getting away with it would also be smart enough to understand the risks and not bother, unless they expected something huge, like personal kudos from Voldemort---but by the time that's a factor, Hermione might be able to defend herself or have contingencies in place.

I mean, she will have spent enough time in misery and paranoia that her mind would instinctively reject any feeling of contentment, rendering her immune to the Imperius. (I am only half joking.)
