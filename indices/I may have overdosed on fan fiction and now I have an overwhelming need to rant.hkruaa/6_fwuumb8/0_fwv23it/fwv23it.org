  Throw Hermione in there and she will likely end up dead before her time at Hogwarts is over. See the general support for purging all Muggleborn above.

Maybe.

I don't think there would be an actual murder attempt until Voldemort's return (or maybe not even until his public return), for the simple reason that an actual dead student could not be swept under the rug, and Slytherin culture doesn't engender that much trust among the Slytherins themselves, making it too risky. (Once Voldemort returns, Dumbledore no longer has the monopoly on uberwizard violence, and so a student may choose to do the deed and flee Hogwarts to join Voldemort.)

What is more likely is a concerted bullying campaign aimed at making Hermione drop out, involving students of all years. This is something that didn't happen in /Applied Cultural Anthropology/, where Hermione's troubles stemmed entirely form her own year, but I can see it happening. This will test Hermione's dedication to her "killed---or, worse, expelled" mindset. Snape might intervene to some extent, but he can't really stop the verbal abuse and the ostracism; and he probably can't stop all physical attacks, either.

Now, if Hermione manages to hang on and not have her studies too impeded by the bullying, it's not implausible that by the time Voldemort returns, if he returns on canon schedule, she might in fact be able to defend herself from feasible assassination attempts. Heuristically, if she can progress in magic twice as rapidly as the Hogwarts curriculum, then she could be skilled enough to earn Os on the (hypothetical) OWLs in 3 years and NEWTs in 4, and if she can find some way to practice magical combat, she may well be too dangerous a target by the time Voldemort returns.

I think that she has enough talent and discipline to do that, given her canon track record of learning magic quickly and just from books [1], especially if she can get the subject matter teachers to lend her a few minutes once in a while when she is stuck. Actually translating that to fighting skills would probably be more challenging, depending on how often she has to physically defend herself. (Dating Viktor Krum, if that happens, may well help there.)

--------------

[1] People who say that Hermione isn't that talented but just reads a lot refute themselves. There is a reason schools don't just give each student a stack of books at the start of the term and tell them to come back at the end of the term to sit the exam. For most complex subjects, picking one up just from reading about it indicates a rare talent.
