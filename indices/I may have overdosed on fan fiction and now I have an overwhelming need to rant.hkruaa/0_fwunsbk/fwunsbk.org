I mean, they kind of do. The central conflict is the systemic oppression of muggleborns enforced by the pureblood establishment. The reason there's a culture of hatred is because the last Dark Lord explicitly declared war on non-magical blood, that generation of Slytherin went along with it, and then when their kids came up to age they gladly went along for the ride. How are you supposed to negotiate with an ideology that doesn't even believe you deserve to exist?

Also, there is an example of a "good" Slytherin in the books, Slughorn. And I think Rowling was very careful in crafting his character as a "positive" interpretation of Slytherin values. If your values are cunning and ambition, and you intend to succeed, at some point you'll encounter the "old boy's club," so to speak, or elite social networks you're just not a part of. When you read canon as being written by a struggling single mother, the harsh portrayals of the "house of cunning and ambition" make a lot of sense.
