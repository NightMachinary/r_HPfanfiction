If you would like to read a fic that showcases the rot in Slytherin, but affirms that Slytherin does not have to mean evil; that works within the politics of the House while also gradually reforming its more toxic habits; that demands bravery from its heroes, but ultimately requires them to win through the power of information and careful planning; that acknowledges and embraces coexistence and even collaboration without conforming to the same values - I quite like linkffn(The Peace Not Promised). Severus Snape, after his canon death, is offered a chance to return to the term after his breakup with Lily and do things differently. He accepts in hopes that he can keep her alive this time; to him, that would make anything else worthwhile.

The part that might particularly interest you is that, in addition to his devotion to Lily, he still feels a duty to the students, having been a teacher and Headmaster. So he sets out, starting as a student, to gain influence and respect so he can make Slytherin House safer for the loners and outcasts and those too young to protect themselves.

  He turned slowly to the silent Slytherins, their eyes boring into him in an almost tangible way. "I lay the decree tonight. None should harm another of their House. None ignores another's cries for help." He turned, directing his last to the suddenly silent crowd. The fearful Hufflepuffs and the confused Ravenclaws, the proud and arrogant Gryffindors.

  "Slytherin stands together despite you all!" He roared, and as his deep echoing voice faded, silence greeted him back.
