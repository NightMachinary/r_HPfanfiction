I think that we need to unpack this complaint a little. There are actually two claims here (embodying two common complaints in the treatment of Slytherin):

1. Slytherins are mistreated (ostracised, bullied, vilified) by other characters (including Harry) in canon, and those characters should have treated the Slytherins better.

2. Slytherins are portrayed as nearly universally evil (or at least not-very-good) by JKR, and she should have been more nuanced in her portrayal.

On Item 1, the worst treatment Slytherins get in canon as Slytherins is losing the House Cup twice---after winning it 7 years in a row due to Snape's cheating. Also, the Weasley Twins might have booed someone during the sorting that one time. Other than that, they don't get ostracised or bullied that we observe, and they are pretty much judged by the content of their individual character and expressed values.

On Item 2, to summarise my top-level post, when you take children who think that being selfish and deceitful are not bad things, put them together with others who had thought the same things, and have them stew for seven years under a mentor who also went through that system, what else would you expect? The number of decent people to emerge from that kind of system would, in fact, be negligible. And, maybe a particularly powerful and charismatic leader (whether as a student, as head of house, or as the headmaster) might be able to reform the culture a bit, would the reforms survive past the reformer's tenure?

In the end, linkffn(Anything but Slytherin by IP82) may have been a bit extreme, but the Slytherin house was a bad idea to create in the first place: it is a badly designed institution that produces bad outcomes. And yet, it's not an unrealistic mistake to make for some wizards living in XI Century: we, as a society, enjoy stories about tricksters, con artists, and ambitious people, and always have. It is easy to forget that traits that make for an interesting fictional character can make for a terrible human being (e.g., Umbridge) and that while one trickster can be fun to read about, a functioning society requires a great deal of trust.
