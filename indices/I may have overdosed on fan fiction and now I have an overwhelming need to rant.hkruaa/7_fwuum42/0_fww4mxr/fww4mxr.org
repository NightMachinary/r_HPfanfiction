I would love that very much, thank you. I'm not trying to whitewash Slytherin and defend a metaphorical Nazi ideology. I just find it disappointing that from the get go a bunch of 11 year olds are branded as unredeemable. If you ostracise and bully a bunch of children telling them they're evil of course it's no surprise that they do end up evil. My problem with canon is that it never tries to tackle that cycle of inherited mutual prejudice. So yeah, I would love a fic that shows how you can combat toxic habits.
