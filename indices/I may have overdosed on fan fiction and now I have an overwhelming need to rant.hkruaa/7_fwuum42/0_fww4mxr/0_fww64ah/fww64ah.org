I really like how Severus approaches the political situation in this fic.

He starts by refusing to submit to bullying from someone currently at the top of the pecking order, then using his superior duelling skills (after all, he has a lifetime of memories) to very quickly and easily trounce him in front of witnesses - but then allows his foe to retain some status as his subordinate. When others are uncomfortable with the upset and challenge him, he similarly shows them up.

Then, having established himself, he pivots that influence and demands House unity and mutual protection - thus winning the hearts of most of the younger years, who would otherwise fear for their own safety.

Once that begins to succeed, with several students finding themselves rescued from sticky situations where they would previously have been on their own, he further leverages the goodwill he's gained and publicly declares his intention not to be a Death Eater. He doesn't declare war on them; he merely splits from them. The result is to break up the near-monopoly of influence that the prospective Death Eaters enjoyed; some students stand with Severus, some oppose him, but many remain neutral /and can get away with it/. His close associates include both muggle-borns and blood purists, and he allows them to be; he only insists that while they are at school, everyone is safe and is allowed to focus on being a student.

It's simple, yet so very effective. And when he disavows the Death Eaters, Lily welcomes her friend back with open arms.
