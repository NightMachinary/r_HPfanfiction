  They're children! Was there really nooooo way to contrive of a character Harry could have even a small connection to in Slytherin?

The answer to that would've been Mafalda Prewett. But JK Rowling cut her due to the fact that there wasn't much that a first-year could do for the plot that Rita Skeeter couldn't.

Basically, Mafalda was supposed to be a distant maternal-cousin of Ron's. Her father was the Squib-accountant Ron mentioned in book one, and Mafalda would've started school and joined Slytherin in Harry's fourth year.

She was described as being an almost insufferable brat who was a match for Hermione in some things. And the fact that this little troublemaker knew all the rules, etc. tended to unsettle Hermione a bit.

Mafalda's purpose would've been to spy on her fellow Slytherins, especially the ones connected to the Dark families, and pass on information to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Mafalda was set to be like that little brat who, despite being arrogant and rude, you can't really hate --- because she's on your side.

But in the end, Rowling opted to make Rita Skeeter the designated source of snooping.
