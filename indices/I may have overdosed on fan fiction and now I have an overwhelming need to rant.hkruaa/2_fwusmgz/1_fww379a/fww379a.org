Thank you so much for explaining where it's from! I'm definitely filing that info away. Someone else on the thread said that Sirius is the one who used it in canon (which makes sense especially considering Grimmauld Place, etc etc). Would you find it odd for the Weasley kids/Hermione/Harry to be using it all the way from first year? They're canonically a tad older than me but it seems(?) quite regional.
