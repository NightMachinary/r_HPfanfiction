Regarding your last point - my dad uses the word berk all the time. It's very common in old east london and essex way, and comes from the cockney rhyming slang (and mispronounciation) of Berkshire Hunt, as far as I'm aware. Quite old fashioned and dated now, but definitely of Rowling's generation and I'm pretty sure it was used in canon at least once.
