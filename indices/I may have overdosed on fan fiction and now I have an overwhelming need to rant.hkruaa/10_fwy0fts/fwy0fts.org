There's only so much "moral dilemmas" you can toss into a book and still make it a focused narrative. Slytherins are what they are because slytherins for the most part are stereotypical antagonists. JK could dilute this, but that would have likely detracted from the story by unnecessary convolution of relationships.

If you are looking for "complex and ambiguous" - see house elves, treatment of muggleborns, child neglect etc... HP has all of that. there's no need to toss every moral dilemma out there into narrative. slytherin is what it is and I think it servers the narrator's purpose well.

Just as well as slytherin fics serve to tell a different story, but then again, their /purpose/ is explicitly to tell a Slytherin story. HP canon is not that
