Yeah, I definitely agree with you to a great extent. I know that ultimately a lot of my complaints about canon can't be remedied at all if that's the story you want to tell. Which is why I love FanFiction so much, I love it because you're able to tell stories from perspectives and variables you just can't in canon and that can make for richer stories. Similarly FanFiction can't exist without the background of canon and playing on the foundations it sets. It's very interesting from an aesthetics perspective... but that aside, the ultimate conclusion of my original post which I totally accept got lost in my rant, was that I love FanFiction because it can explore avenues that weren't and/or couldn't be explored in canon.
