I have a soft spot for Slytherin!Resorting fics, particularly if it's Hermione or Ron, but I think that the canon portrayal of Slytherin is completely justified. In fact, the single biggest factor in runing otherwise decent Slytherin!Protagonist fics is Bizzaro-world-level whitewashing of Slytherin.

TL;DR: Creating a House around Salazar Slytherin's values was a mistake, and the Slytherin that we see in canon is a natural consequence of building a culture around these values. On the other hand, that makes for a more interesting story when someone who doesn't naturally fit in is Sorted there.

--------------

Fundamentally, being /cunning/ is about practising manipulation and deceit to achieve one's aims. Personally /ambitious/ people similarly embrace egoism and placing themselves above others as a goal. Nice, helpful children don't get sorted into Slytherin in the first place, and then the House amplifies their worst traits. (Children who are helpful but not nice---who want to fix the world whether the world wants it or not---go to Gryffindor, as Dumbledore and Hermione did.)

A particularly amoral individual (i.e., Salazar Slytherin) might value cunning and ambition in themselves, and they may value these things in their children or successors, but try to build a culture around these traits---such as by putting all people who embrace them in the same dormitory---and you end up with a culture of brutes, toadies, plutocrats, and con artists. And, even without Salazar's original disdain for the Muggleborn, a blood purity culture would probably emerge on its own: to take a line from President Lyndon B. Johnson, "If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket." The plutocrats and the con artists wouldn't be able to resist using blood prejudice to keep the brutes and the toadies in line.

It's not clear why Harry is obligated to love people like that, or to trust them with his and his friends' lives and freedom by letting them join the DA. There were plenty of situations in his life that were not black-and-white. This isn't one of them.

All the "good" Slytherins you list aren't very good:

- Regulus was a trusted Death Eater---and one doesn't get there without committing his fair share of torture and murder. He was OK with all that, and it's only with what is considered the Darkest of Dark Arts did Voldemort cross the line.
- Narcissa was a high-level collaborator who used what influence she had to further Voldemort's cause---such as getting Snape to make that Unbreakable Vow in HBP---and who only changed her mind to save her own son. Other people's sons and daughters could go pound sand. (All things considered, the Order could have gotten her cooperation far sooner by taking Draco hostage.)
- Snape's fall to darkness is largely thanks to this Slytherin culture: a penniless half-Muggle sorted there during Voldemort's first rise, he had little choice but to practice Dark Arts and be friendly with unsavoury individuals. He switched sides for revenge first and foremost.

We do see Slytherins who are not too bad:

- Andromeda is probably the only Slytherin we see who actually threw off the blood prejudice that was prevalent in the House.
- Slughorn is a coward and a wheeler-and-dealer who uses his position as a Professor for personal gain, but he does fight Voldemort at the end.

Now, being sorted into a House like that for someone who isn't a natural fit---a Weasley, or a Muggleborn---that makes for an interesting story.
