No, if you are a pureblood supremacist/have taken that belief from your parents, you end up in Slytherin since he was the only one pursuing that agenda while the other founders stood against it. It might be different if you radicalise later in life, but there is no canonical evidence of anyone actually doing that. Although maybe some of the werewolves would fit this, but there is no evidence.

You can still be a dick in other houses, the Smith in Hufflepuff is a good example for this, but not "purge the muggleborn".
