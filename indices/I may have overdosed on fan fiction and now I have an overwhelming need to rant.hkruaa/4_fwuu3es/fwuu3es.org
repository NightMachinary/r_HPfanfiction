Well, it's a matter of statistics, if 99% of the Slytherins are bad, there is no point in trying for the sake of the one misguided guy that no one knows how he ended there. It's like going to a neonazi club to give them a chance because someone there may have been brainwashed by his parents. It's a children's book, it's really is black and white. Either you're in Griffindor and are one of the good guys, or are in Slytherin and one of the bad guys. The other houses might as well not even exist lol.
