I disagree. There are some, but I honestly cant remember them off the top of my head. Would have to spend some time wracking my brain or doing research to remember the ones I have read/seen.

Also for the OP: Emperor is a VERY good fic, but be warned, its so AU that it almost doesn't count as HPFF in my view. And as Inquisitor said, it does not really fit the "dark lord" aspect.
