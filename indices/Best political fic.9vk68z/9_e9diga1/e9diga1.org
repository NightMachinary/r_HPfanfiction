I really enjoy the politics in linkffn(Again and Again by Athey), though HP/LV is not everyone's cup of tea (this is probably the fic where that pairing is most believable tho, since Harry is basically immortal and keeps getting reborn in his infant body when he dies, with all the memories and magic of his previous lives).
