I'm surprised that no one mentioned Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man. It's got really complex world building and very enjoyable politics as well as subversion of the WBWL trope. Flye Autumne's Chessmaster series is also pretty good. It follows a Slytherin!Trio (Harry, Hermione, and Ron). The first in the series is The Chessmaster: Black Pawn.
