Okay so, my favourite political fic is a Tom/Hermione time travel fic. It's a two part fic and the first doesn't really deal with politics, however it's essential for foundation.

The second is not linear - it could be described as a series of one shots set in the same universe that are insights into Tom's political career. It's one of the most in depth and fascinating reads about Wizarding politics I've ever read, and includes interludes into international waters, their family life, and the forging of an entirely separate political party from the existing Light and Dark sides.

Also good to note, the author has it marked as â€˜complete' but occasionally comes back and adds one-shots to A Marked Deck.
