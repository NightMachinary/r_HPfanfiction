My only issue with Emperor (which I loved for the better part of like 40 frickin chapters) is that it gets so drawn out with the battles. I got so bored by the time the north and south were at war. I stopped reading it because I just felt it was never going anywhere and I read some reviews which talked about how they abandoned it because some of the plot points don't make sense.
