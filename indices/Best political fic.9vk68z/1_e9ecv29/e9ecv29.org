It's a short story about Neville and Hermione becoming political rivals during the post-war period. Hermione wants to abolish the wizarding aristocracy (which she blames for the War) and make magical Britain a Republic. Neville is a conservative who is skeptical of democracy and radical change; he's no blood-purist, but he prefers to preserve traditions and thinks it's better for the aristocracy to carefully implement reforms instead of the government bow to the whims of the masses. It's told from Neville's perspective and does a good job of showing his anti-democractic stance in a sympathetic light while still making it clear that he's on the wrong side of history.

(Yes, the CGI title card is really ugly. Ignore it, the story is far better I promise.)
