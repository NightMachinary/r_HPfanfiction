The Ghost of Privet Drive by AndrewWolfe fits your "OC dies and gets transported to HP world". Significant departure from canon, and also lots of "this is different from the books I read back in the real world" moments. linkao3(21500365)

This is extremely well-written with tons of cultural references from the "real" time period of Harry's childhod. Not being a Brit, I spent a fair amount of time on Google after some of the chapters. It also has extensive author's notes about these details---but people who hate excessive author's notes can skip them without affecting the story at all.

Over the course of the story, it veered quite a bit from interactions with Harry. Author was posting as he was writing, and said if he'd planned it out ahead of time that would have been a side story. (Harry hasn't even got his Hogwarts letter yet.) This story is marked complete with a sequel promised, hopefully getting back on track with a Harry-centric plot line.
