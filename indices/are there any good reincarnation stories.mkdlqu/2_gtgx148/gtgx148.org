There are a bunch! Few completed though (and thus there are many which I've subscribed to but haven't written down the title of). If you haven't already I recommend looking for collections with SI/OC stories of AO3. Like this one [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/SIOC_Insert_Collection][A Collection of Beloved Inserts]]

A few random recommendations:

this one is gold though it's a oneshot linkao3(8906032)

The first of a series but I think it works as a standalone linkao3(Accio Butterflies by tearlessNevermore)

Ongoing and really good linkao3(Fractured Fairytale by Tsume_Yuki)

This one hasn't updated since 2018, but so still worth a read as it's very well written linkffn(Ottery St Catchpole by Erisah Mae)

And here are some that are like... Adjacent to what you're asking for

Brilliant linkao3(The Potter's Seer by Spellmugwump)

A bit weird very fun linkffn(Tom and Evie by MerhppDerhpp)
