I love OC/reincarnated fanfics from HP world too! Maybe I have read too much fanfic with the usual HP main characters and got sick of it (the rinse and repeat of same plot). However I still love the HP world setting. Be glad if you have any suggestions as well.

Currently following one that is updated everyday. The MC is an OC that is studying in Hogwarts in the same year as Harry Potter and is good friends with Hermione (but not with HP and Ron). The link is here: [[https://www.webnovel.com/book/harry-potter-new-world_19337489706185205]]
