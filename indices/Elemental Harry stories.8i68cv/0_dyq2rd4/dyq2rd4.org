A question about Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power, does it get better? The dialogue is just bad and in no way how any 11 year old would ever talk, "Well goodbye bitches, see you next year" for example. It just is so ooc for any Harry to talk like that, or, even worse, the line after the first portkey ( ch 4). All super not in line with any children.

Coupled with Harry just getting the elderwand by buying it from Ollivanders and his general "opness" just makes the fic feel bad.

But i have seen it recommended to often for it to be completly garbage and id hate to miss out on it, is it like prince of slytherin where you just have to fight through a horrible opening to get to the good parts?
