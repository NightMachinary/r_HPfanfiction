The dialogue and grammar get a little better, and there's a few spelling mistakes and things to slog through, but even with all that it's a really entertaining story and is still one of my favorites, just due to a lot of interesting takes on things and how fun the fight scenes are. It's like an action flick you can just put on and not pay attention to, but still follow along with half an ear. some weird shit, but still definitely a fun story
