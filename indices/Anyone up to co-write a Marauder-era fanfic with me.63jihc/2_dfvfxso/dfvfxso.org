Sure thing. Give me a premise and I'll write an episode up for you.

Best to make it a bit of a round robin though. Get as many ff writers interested as you can, assign them prompts/timelines (like 'Hogwarts, 4th year, November') and get them to write it out.

Give me a prompt or an idea and I'll run with it. If you want me to just come up with something myself, okay but it'll take a little longer. PM me with a response either way.
