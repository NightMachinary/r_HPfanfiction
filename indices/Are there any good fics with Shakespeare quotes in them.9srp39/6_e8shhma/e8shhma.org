[[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1318815/The-Carnivorous-Muffin][The Carnivorous Muffin]] tends to write fics that quote/reference scifi and classic literature. In particular, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] has some Shakespeare quotes from Hamlet, As You Like It, etc. at important moments. It's a delightfully surreal AU fic which I highly recomend.
