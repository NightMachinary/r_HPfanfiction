The series by swissdog "Harry's Future", "Professor Potter", "Harry Potter and the Children of the Clan" and "Harry Potter and the Magic War" (ongoing if slowly updated) linkffn(4335716; 5454173; 8512776; 11328983) which maybe isn't the best you can find but I like it still.

If I remember well it followed mostly cannon for known information (but not all) but it added quite a few things (OC and all). Maybe a bit of an OP Harry but facing also high level threats. This fic being amongst the first I read I won't be objective on it though X).

And btw the correct flair would have been "Request" (Recommendation being if you recommend something to read).
