Strongly recommend this fic. Probably Taure's best written work yet-- Victoria is quite distinct from Harry, kids are kids but still interesting, the bits of magic explored are done extremely well (as usual for a Taure fic) and make you want more worldbuilding not less, and the plot has diverged quite nicely from canon.
