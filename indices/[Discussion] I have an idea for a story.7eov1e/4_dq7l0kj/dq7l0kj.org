Magical society being a different society is already a Thing in fanfic. Bearing in mind that the books are set in the years 1991 to 1998, the fairly common tropes of homosexuality being completely accepted/completely abhorrent (take your pick, they're both out there) are obviously from a different society from real contemporaneous non-magical society. And anything involving polygamy, arranged marriages, or acknowledged and sanctioned under-age relationships is too. Male pregnancy plays with gender roles.

The currency is of course different in canon.

In an awful lot of fanfic the political system appears to be modeled (usually without the authors' knowledge I'm sure) on something from around about the 1200s mixed in with the 1700s and 1800s - a powerful House of Lords (the Wizengamot) that enacts and enforces legislation and whose members have special rights, with no effective check on their power, and with open bribery and legal Jesuitism - and the politics is mostly presented in fanfic as being solely along an Isolationist vs Integrationist axis instead of the two economically liberal/authoritarian and socially liberal/authoritarian axes that real-world politics is often simplistically portrayed as.

Manners are often presented in fanfic as being a weird combination of styles from various places in the real world and times in history that are clearly different from the non-magical world.

As for language, given that the statute of secrecy dates from 1689, there have been almost exactly 300 years for language to diverge. Assuming that magicals and non-magicals have diverged in different directions (a reasonable assumption given your predicate of isolation) we could expect the difference to be about the same as between modern English and that of around the year 1400. And that's not that different. Chaucer is readable today with only minimal support from Ye Olde Dictionarie. However, you also say that you want to keep the influx of Muggleborns, so they would have at least /some/ influence on the language. Therefore the difference would be less than between Chaucer and modern English.
