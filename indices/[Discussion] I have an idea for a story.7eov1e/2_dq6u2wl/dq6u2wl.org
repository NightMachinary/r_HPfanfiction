Oh there was one like that. I remember that McGonagall had a meeting with muggle-born children and their parents to explain history and traditions. There was something terribly weird with all the female children being drawn to Harry or something, or the other way around, which understandably creeped the parents out. Can't remember much else, but somehow I am sure that it fits your request. Hope anyone knows the name of it though:(
