I'm a Dramione fan also and recommend linkffn(Rebuilding by Colubrina) and linkffn(And We All Fall Down by Rumaan)

There's a popular non-Dramione Draco-centric fic that I haven't read yet that I know a lot of people tend to like but for the life of me I can't remember the name, I think it's Draco/MuggleOC

Edit: Found it! linkffn(Exile by bennybear)
