linkffn(The Malfoy Case) This is a Malfoy/Astoria fic that focuses on his his trial after the war. Romance is not the focus although Astoria does play his lawyer so she has major part in this story. The author seems to have a lot of knowledge of the judicial system and court cases. I can't say for sure since I know nothing about the courts or trials, but it read like a real trial which I found quite interesting.
