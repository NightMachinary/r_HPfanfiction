I don't think she is lawyer in canon, it's never stated what she does or how she met Draco. One of the theories is that it may have been an arranged marriage by their parents, but it's not clear. Her actual backstory from what I know is that she marries Draco, has a child with him (Scorpios), then tragically dies sometime later so Draco has to raise his son alone.
