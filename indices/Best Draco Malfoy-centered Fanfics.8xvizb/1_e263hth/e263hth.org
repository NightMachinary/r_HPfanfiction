The only Malfoy fanfics I know are Draco/Hermione because I'm a big fan of that pairing. A great one is The Fallout (not sure how to link fan fictions, sorry) but it should be easy to find - it's usually in Dramione fans' top 10 list! It's novel length and a dark war fic so you're in for a commitment, but I find the characters are excellent and believable.
