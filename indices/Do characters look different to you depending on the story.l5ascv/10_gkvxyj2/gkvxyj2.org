Harry and Ginny are the main ones that vary for me.

By default I imagine a runty abused Harry who looks much like I did when I was underweight in my late teens, but with shorter darker hair, a little more muscle from Quidditch training, green eyes rather than hazel, and just, y'know, generally more attractive in terms of facial features and stuff. Being compared to Harry from the book covers is why I grew my hair out and switched from round to rectangular lenses.

When Harry's described as being all tall and broad shouldered and shit, I imagine something like a cross between Daniel Radcliffe and Handsome Squidward.

Similar issues with Ginny - in my mind I have potions-creep!Ginny who looks like movie Ginny, and then I have hot!Ginny who has a totally different face, slightly curly hair that's more flaming red, and a constant mischievous smirk like a third Weasley twin. Different body shape as well. Basically a completely different character depending on whether I like how she's portrayed.
