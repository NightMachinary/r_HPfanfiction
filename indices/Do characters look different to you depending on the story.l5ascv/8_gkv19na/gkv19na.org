Well, I can't actually "see" any characters when I read (or just think), but I do see them differently depending on what I read. Harry usually defaults as short and skinny but what he looks like changes as I read the fic.

It's the same when I read Supernatural fics. I don't read about Dean and see Jensen Ackles.
