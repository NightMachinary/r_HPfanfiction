Daniel Radcliffe is great at Harry but he doesn't exactly match the book description. I picture him differently anyway. I don't really deviate from the idea of canon book Harry but that's how I picture him.

Harry is supposed to be tall, messy haired, green eyed. Daniel just doesn't match. His hair is closest it gets and even then it's just the style.
