This is basically how it is for me. Most stories make a note of his physical characteristics (like whether he is small for his age and/or suffers/ed from extended malnutrition or what not). If they don't mention it at all I guess I see him as my initial interpretation of him from his physical characteristics in the books. Basically like a less good looking Daniel Radcliffe.
