It depends on the character. Some characters have fixed visual appearances in my mind, and even if a fic decides to contradict it, it doesn't really influence my longterm visual impression of them for the fic (like, I can imagine makeovers and such, but they don't really last as I continue to read). These cases are mostly movie characters, and some major characters that feature in a lot of fics I read (for instance, teenage Severus or Lily in Marauder-era fics or adult Hermione in postwar). Some have a "default" appearance but isn't fixed enough, so fics contradicting it can change it. An example of this is Daphne Greengrass. Then, there are characters that don't have a visual representation in my mind at all, because they have appeared infrequently enough to not make a solid impression on me. This obviously includes all OCs, but also people like Theodore Nott or Marlene McKinnon.
