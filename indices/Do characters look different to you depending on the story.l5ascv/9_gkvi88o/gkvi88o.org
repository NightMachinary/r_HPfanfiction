Yes, for me this really makes an influence. When I read about a martial arts Harry, I have some real trouble connecting him to my baseline Daniel Radcliffe Harry who is a bid pudgy in those last movies. That said, if anyone writes a blue eyes Harry without any explanation I drop the story.

However, the way I imagined Lupin never could unite with the movies porn moustache and the manner in which his clothing and looks are described made a huge difference for me as well. What really ticks me off is when people disregard Rowling's source material about the amber/yellow werewolf eyes, and they start waxing poetic about his baby blues.

When people write book 3 Sirius as an unkempt tramp I really can't reunite him with the always smooth looking Gary Oldman.

Snape is even worse. 99% of the people actually describe Alan Rickman in stead of Rowling's Severus Snape, so I see Alan Rickman (but that voice will stay always with me regardless).

But especially with the actors with less screen time I will really see in my mind's eye what the author describes. But that might have something to do with the fact that if I was even marginally worse at faces than I already am, I couldn't even pick my husbands face out of a line up.
