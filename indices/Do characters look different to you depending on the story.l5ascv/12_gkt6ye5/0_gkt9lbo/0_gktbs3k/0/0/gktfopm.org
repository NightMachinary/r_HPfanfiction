Well, I am not much into heavy-abuse Dursleys, but I can accept that years over underfeeding can limit child's growth. And the boy's height at 11 is quite unreliable predictor of his height as an adult.

And concerning the Mirror of Erised, the only description of his parents I can find is this:

#+begin_quote
  She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes --- her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green --- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did.

It doesn't say that Harry was as tall as James. Almost just contrary, it emphasises how James was tall (as if Harry was not), but that's a speculation. Or did I miss it somewhere else?
