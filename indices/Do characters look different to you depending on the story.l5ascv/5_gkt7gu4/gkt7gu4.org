Hermione is one who varies a bit to me. I think if she's dating Harry she generally puts a bit more effort into her appearance and her hair doesn't appear as bushy but more soft waves. I know in Harry Crow she is very atheletic so I always think of her as rather flat-chested there with a runner's body.

Harry varies a lot. Sometimes he's really malnourished, he takes potions and vitamins to get back to his recommended weight/height for his age. I usually see him about 5"7' - 5"10', slim atheletic build. Even in the AUs when he's treated well he's not considered that big. I think Harry is one of the youngest of his year which definitely makes him seem smaller than the rest.

Ron is always the tall, lanky one. I'm not nsure how tall he will end up (he does have a healthy appetite) but he will always be tall compared to Hermione and Harry.

Ginny is described as quite pretty but I never see her that way. I always see her as very freckly with skin that would burn in the sun. Kinda like a female Seamus.

Hufflepuffs always seem the same. Slightly chubby (with a little baby fat). Ravenclaws seem a bit thin on the side (maybe they forget to eat or something).
