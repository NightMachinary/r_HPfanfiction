Ginny's interesting because there actually is a lot of characterization there, yet she was used so sparsely that it feels like she is a poorly developed character, likely because none of that development happens on the pages or is woven into an actual story. But we do not a lot about Ginny. Off the top of my head:

- stubborn
- fiercely independent (a common scene throughout the books is Ginny fighting to be included in dangerous things/discussions but is told she is too young
- dry, biting sense of humor
- jealous
- often mean to those she disagrees with and Ron (while a lot of Ginny's mean behavior can be justified, in HBP she can be downright vicious to Ron for absolutely no reason, not including the snogging scene)
- very loyal towards Harry (defending him after the sectumsempra incident, presumably staying faithful to him while he's on the Horcrux hunt)
- kind to those others put down (Luna and Neville)
- very pretty
- great at quidditch
- popular
- devious and ambitious (sneaking into the broom shed to nick her brothers brooms; essentially using other boys to put herself in better standing with Harry)
- comforting (seems to know what to say to Harry at any given moment, also when she is comforting the injured girl during the final battle
- incredibly brave (leading the DA, sneaking her way into the final battle, as well as participating in the DoM and Astronomy tower battles

So we actually know a lot about Ginny. Yet very few of the points I mentioned directly relate to the plot. Thus, she doesn't seem that present in the books.

Also, her overcoming Voldemort's possession her first year would have been incredibly interesting to see and develop her character significantly, yet we don't see it. Ditto her struggles to get over Harry. She tells him at the end she never gave up on him, yet she did seriously date two other boys. It would've been great to go into her mind about those relationships, but we don't see it.

The biggest problem, ultimately, is that we are supposed to believe her and Harry are incredibly important to each other, yet they only date for a few weeks (compared to a combined two years with Michael and Dean). Ginny should have been developed specifically in the confines of a developing romantic relationship with Harry, which should've began with them becoming legitimate friends way sooner in the series, and culminating with a longer actual relationship. There was no reason why Rowling couldn't have had a big scene after the Chamber (perhaps in OOTP) where Ginny lays it all out to Harry about what she experienced that year and beyond. And there should've been a scene where Ginny calls Harry out for trying to protect her before and during the battle when she can fight for herself, as she's been doing the past year. We needed bigger scenes with the two.

So....

Having said all that, the fact that we do know a lot about who Ginny is means that fanfiction is perfect for her character development. I'd argue that she is one of, if not the best character for fanfiction. There are so many ways to take Ginny that keep her true to canon, and some authors do a great job of capturing her essence, typically in post-battle stories. Little0bird is one of the best at taking traits of Ginny's (in one case, her quest for independence) and realistically inserting that into stories of her life after the battle and her relationship with Harry.

But what is most frustrating is that so many fanfics that focus on Harry and Ginny completely change who Ginny is. They make her a weepy mess of insecurities that can't believe Harry loves her, or they make her the damsel in distress despite it explicitly being someone she would never be after the Chamber.

There are too many fics that exaggerate her temper and just make her a shrill version of her mother (seriously, would Ginny ever yell "HARRY JAMES POTTER) as the only characterization of Ginny. Conversely there are too few fics that capture her wit and biting sense of humor.

The best characterizations of Ginny are those that capture her sense of humor, her independent nature and the fact that she is a fighter. While I enjoy fics where Harry and Ginny break up and then get back together, it isn't really reflective of Ginny's character. Ginny would not be a doormat, but she would fight like hell for Harry. Canon is pretty clear about that, which would explain why they got back together after the battle even though Harry trying to keep her out of the battle probably pissed her off.

TL;DR: there is actually a lot of characterization of Ginny in the books, but the lack of screen time and connection to the overall plot made her seem thin. Rowling needed a few more scenes of her dealing with her two major storylines (dealing with the Chamber incident; her developing relationship with Harry). Fanfiction is a great resource for expounding on her character, and she is perhaps the perfect character for fanfiction; however too many authors abandon the canonical traits Ginny possesses, even though she is ripe for further development that stays within canon.
