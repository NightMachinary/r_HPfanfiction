I only have one word, overused.

I have nothing against her as a character because there is nothing about her in cannon other than being a fangirl early and she's a Weasley. I hate her in fanfiction because I'm tired of seeing her all the time in fanfics and I honestly hate the idea of one big happy Weasley family. I hate Hermione with a passion so I don't care where she ends up but I can't stand that Harry never branches out to other houses, I hate the Bill/Fleur pairing and at this point I just avoid fics where the Weasleys are relevant.
