The classic example is linkffn(Angry Harry and the Seven), it's even in the name. It's also awful, but that kind of comes with the territory; extremely angry Harrys generally make for poor writing. The angriest Harry I can think of off the top of my head that still has a decent story is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia).
