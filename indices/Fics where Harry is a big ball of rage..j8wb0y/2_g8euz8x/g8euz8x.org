The best ones I can think of are [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12110685/chapters/27461091][All Impulse and No Control]], where Harry loses his filter and becomes a ranting, angry, nuisance. It is HPDM, but nothing happens till like the end and it's easily ignored. The other is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11588556/1/Ignition][Ignition]], where Harry has fire powers and a temper. Sadly it was abandoned before it could go anywhere, but what's there is pretty good I think.
