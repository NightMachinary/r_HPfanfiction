  At the height of his power, Lord Voldemort employed another failsafe next to the horcruxes: his most loyal followers would be able to retrieve them and resurrect him with their help. As a result, Barty Crouch Jr. breaks his father's mind control early and goes off to seek his master.While he is unsuccessful in locating him, he manages to find surprising but welcome allies in the Boy-Who-Lived and his godfather. With the support of the Ancient and Noble House of Black on his side, Barty needs to use all his cunning and guile to navigate the world of politics and Dark Arts. And so, four years after their first meeting, a different Harry Potter will arrive at Hogwarts: one who wants nothing more than to bring Lord Voldemort back and who will stop at nothing to achieve his goal.
