The Well Groomed Mind linkao3(427653) has Barty as a central character. Harry takes private lessons from "Moody", and he figures out that "Moody" is a Death Eater rather earthly, but continues on to build a strong mentor/apprentice relationship.

I also recommend mad_fairy's series, both Ninja Wizard linkao3(10824855) and Mischief's Heir linkao3(4629198). Two different series but they have the same backstory for Barty: the Lestranges convince him they're Harry's legal guardians and he helps them find Harry with the best of intentions. The wards on Privet Drive summon the Aurors who assume Barty was their accomplice and a secret Death Eater. Both stories have him bonding with Sirius over being innocent in Azkaban.
