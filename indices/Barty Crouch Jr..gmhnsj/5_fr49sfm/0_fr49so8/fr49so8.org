#+begin_quote
  A reflection on the relationship between four-year-old Harry and his doting guardian/minion, Barty Crouch Jr. We see a glimpse into the lives of the Petunia and Dudley without Harry around to abuse. Both Petunia and Barty Jr vociferously deny that their respective charges are the least bit spoiled. Part 7 of my Arrested Development series, in which young Harry, abused by the Dursleys, is magically transported to Azkaban. He winds up in Barty Jr's cell. Barty is convinced that the Dark Lord gifted him with Harry to raise as his Prince. Sirius just wants to raise his godson. An unlikely friendship, and an even more unlikely family, forms!
