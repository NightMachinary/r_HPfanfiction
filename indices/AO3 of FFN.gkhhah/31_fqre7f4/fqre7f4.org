I used both, but I find myself more comfortable using [[https://FFN.net][FFN.net]]. AO3 is good if you want to read smut, I feel like, but I much rather read proper stories, you know, long ones that go 300-400k, on FFN. Much more comfortable and it has Dark Mode... so that's a plus.

Never used Quotev and I find myself avoiding Wattpad, as it usually houses the worst stories. (Need to mention here that not all stories on Wattpad are bad, not all stories on FFN or AO3 are good or even bearable, I just made the worst experiences with Wattpad ones.)
