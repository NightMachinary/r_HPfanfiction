FFN is my go-to, but they all have strengths and weaknesses.

I prefer FFN's profile, favorites and downloads system, but it's often times oddly conservative and I honest to God do not get the way your supposed to be able to post things.

Wattpad has what seems to be the most engaging community within comments and such, but has recently taken a turn for the worse-what with the limiting of the number of stories you can have offline/downloaded and really pushing the commercial aspect.

And AO3's tag system, while a bit over the top at times, makes it far easier to find things when you want to read something specific and is more lax with censorship, but keeping track of story updates and the lack of a easily manageable library system is beyond frustrating.

(Oh and I had never heard of Quotev before this, so no opinion on it)
