I read on both Ao3 and FFN but I honestly think that the set-up of Ao3 is superior. The filtration system is better (filtering OUT is WAY better). FFN has a very low max limit on characters in the summary which can make the 'summarizing' task unnecessarily difficult for authors who want to do the opposite of what the Netflix summarizers do, which would be to actually make their work sound like something not inherently boring. The tags system grants extra context to every work without taking up space in the summary.

One of the best parts of Ao3, imo, is that Tag/keyword searches can be filtered by relevent preferences AND ALSO (unlike FFN) sorted according to most words, most kudos, etc.. Every time I search for keywords on FFN, I have to manually mentally compare each title's stats in the results if I want to read an as-yet unread-by-me fic with an established pro-this audience. It is very tedious. The only thing I don't like is that I can't search tags or keywords across multiple individual fandoms without the engine thinking that I want a crossover fic with all those specific fandoms (or those plus whatever else, as is often the case when the engine presents me with Tumblr Drabbles collections), even if I mark the search with 'exclude crossovers'. But another point for the tags is that they can include -cough-unofficial-cough-'genres' (fan tropes or fandom-specific plots) which are not - and never will be - listed on FFN.

Another best part is that authors can link specific works of theirs into a titled series. This series can be easily searched and accessed, and when a reader is finished with one 'book', they can click 'Next Part of the series' and smoothly transition into immersing themselves into another piece. FFN does not have this linking function, so readers have to skim the summaries on an author's page for "Part 1" and "Part 2" (etc.), unable to filter out all the unconnected works of that specific series.

There is also more media and inclusion in general that can be submitted to Ao3. Want an illustrated fanfic? It's not impossible! Dramatic audio reading of a fanfic? They have those too. Want to properly credit another author for a collab fic? Boom. Linked and underlined at the top.

Oh yeah: and I don't normally have to worry on Ao3 about stumbling across a Rated:M which should definitely be rated an E-for-Explicit but cannot be marked as such because the web designers seem to think that 'MATURE should cover just about everything, right? Warfare, gore, creepypasta, and sex'. Well guess what: Some people do not want to be stuck reading tween-appropriate warfare and politics and horror and might like to graduate to more thought-provoking Mature fics without stumbling across literature porn. Ao3 understands this concept.

I have never read on Quotev or Wattpad, mostly because the navigation is unfamiliar to me - I do not understand how to find anything I might actually want, and I certainly like what I already use. (This thing called 'change'? I hate it.)
