FFN is far worse as a writer, because they'll censor you and toss your work at the drop of a hat. To name just one example, Viridian's extremely well known "Nightmares of Futures Past" was deleted without any warning because someone claimed it violated a song's copyright --- no song lyrics existed anywhere in the work. FFN is horrible and deserves no support.
