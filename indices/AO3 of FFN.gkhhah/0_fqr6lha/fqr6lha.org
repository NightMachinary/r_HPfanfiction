I prefer the tag system in AO3 and the ways you can sort it. If you search key words in FFN you cant filter by words, favourites, follows or anything else and that's always bugged me.

That being said I prefer the number of fics on FFN and the profile section, as well as the layout of favourite stories and follows; I think it works better than kudos and bookmarks.

AO3 is better formatted by FFN has a better range of fics.

I've never used Quotev and for some reason any fics I find on Wattpad are the cringey ones with bad grammar you imagine a 13 y/o wrote. Not that there's anything wrong with that, I loved them when I was 13, but it's not what I want now.
