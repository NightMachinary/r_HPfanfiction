Not sure if you already do this, but you can change the skins on AO3 if you're logged in, and one particular skin is exactly the same as the default, but it also sorts the tags into sections so you can easily see pairings, characters, and then everything else as separate rows. Maybe this could improve your experience with tags?

Though I personally love those comments, haha, it gives me a better sense of the writer before I even read the fic, so I know vaguely what to expect of their storytelling style.
