The thing I like about AO3 and the thing I hate about AO3 is the tags. If they were used sensibly and systematically it'd be an amazing system. The way a lot of authors use them completely defeats the purpose behind them. Use them to denote pairings, themes, important things that might identify the story! Don't use for "Draco is such a hottie" or "CuteButNotReallyHotButKindOfABit!Hermione".

And don't use the tags as a second summary. Use the summary for a summary!
