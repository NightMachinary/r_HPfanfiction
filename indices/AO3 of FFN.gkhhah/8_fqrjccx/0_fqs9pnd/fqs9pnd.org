100% this. I only recently started using AO3 after years of fanfiction reading, because I exclusively read on my phone and the simple fact that ffn even /has/ an app is monumental. Add in the text to speech integration which means that I can keep ‘reading' my stories regardless of what I'm doing, and it's really no contest most of the time.

Also tags are great, but being able to filter out romance on ffn is so fucking nice. I don't give a shit about pairings, as long as there's no harem or rape fantasies or anything like that, and ao3 makes pairings one of the fundamental parts of their search features which really steered me away for a long time, as I couldn't figure out how to filter stuff properly.

I just recently discovered the ‘gen' filter on ao3 though so I've started using it more, and I've been pleased so far. It doesn't completely solve the issue, but neither does filtering out romance on ffn, so it's a moot point.
