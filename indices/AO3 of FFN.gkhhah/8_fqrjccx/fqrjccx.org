I've used FFN more than I've used AO3, but I do prefer AO3 in terms of quality and sorting. FFN has more options, though. I think the biggest thing that FFN has over AO3, other than quantity of fanfics, is the app interface. It's much easier to read fanfics on the AP than AO3 due to the simpler system.

As to Wattpad, I wouldn't really recommend it. Searching through is horrible, it has a much younger demographic and most of the fanfics are for One Direction or other real life boy bands that were made by middle schoolers. There's that 1 in a million chance you can find something you like, but it still isn't something I'd really recommend. Plus, users like to steal other's work.
