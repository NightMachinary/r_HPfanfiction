In general I like both, I usually find better written stories on AO3 or FFN than wattpad ( never used Quotev).

While I starting reading fanfictions on AO3, I noticed there were more stories available on FFN, so nowadays I am using more FFN than AO3.

I don't know if this is just me, but often on FFN I have ads in between paragraphs and I find it quite annoying ( whereas AO3 is totaly ad free).
