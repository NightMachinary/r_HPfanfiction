Comments/reviews are also a point of difference.

On FFN, I like to use my reviews as a place to search for a fic I can't remember the title of, but I do recall my reaction to it. So that's great. On the minus side, it only shows your last 300 reviews. And I really dislike that you can't edit or delete reviews that you've made.

On AO3, commenters can actually get into a conversation; it's not limited to yourself and the author. Comments can be edited and deleted, if you made a mistake or want to add to what you said.

To answer your second question, I've never read from either of those. I've never even heard of Quotev before.
