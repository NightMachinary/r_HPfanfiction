I'm a user of FFN and as an author post there. The Fav/Follow system works way better for me than Kudos and Bookmarks, and the fact that when I search for a character I'm basically guaranteed that they'll hold an important position in any story that comes up.

I also view tagging as unnecessary in most cases, since ffs just use a summary, and the editor that Ao3 has just messed with my copy-pasted text documents, making it even harder to cross post.
