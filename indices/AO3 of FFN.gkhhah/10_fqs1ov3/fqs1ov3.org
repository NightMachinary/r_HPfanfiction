/Answered this a few weeks ago, so I'm just copying my response./

There are three things about AO3 that makes it my preferred site:

1. The option to show the entire work on one page. This is great for times when I'm going to be away from a network connection.
2. The ability to select a specific fandom when looking at an author's works. For the more prolific authors this is a must. I despise having to search through dozens of works from fandoms I don't care about for the Harry Potter stories.
3. Series. On ffn, you have to go looking for stories in a series, and read the descriptions to figure out which one comes first. On AO3, not only can you get them listed on a single page, but you can go directly from one story to the next.

For balance, the thing I like most about FFN is the ability to quickly find the "Complete" tag so I can filter out unfinished works. I don't always remember to look for it, but that's on me.
