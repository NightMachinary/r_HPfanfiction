As a phone app I prefer ffn. It has a feature that reads to you so I can tuck the phone in my pocket and still have my eyes/hands free to feed the animals or whatever. Also, if I have to minimize the app for whatever reason, when I reopen the story ffn generally opens the chapter about where I left off. Ao3 starts at the top of the page. I think there's a 3rd reason but it's not coming to mind atm.

I downloaded the Wattpad app, but I've yet to read anything on it. I relate the most to Snape, I'm enamored with his spying proficiency. He's my favorite character and I frequently find myself getting bored with a story if he's not in it. I did a few searches for him on Wattpad and found nothing but smut. Now, I don't care if a story includes smut/slash/het/whatever, but if the romance is the ONLY plot then I'm not interested. Perhaps I just didn't word my search properly, I didn't see a search filter, but if I ever post one of my stories I plan to cross post and looking through search results I felt I'd be the first to post a story not sex oriented.

I've not heard of Quotev, I'll look into it. Thanks for mentioning it.
