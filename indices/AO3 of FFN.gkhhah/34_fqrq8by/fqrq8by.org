I definitely prefer FFN. I've just never really been into AO3. But I like FFN's simplicity and it's what I've gotten used to over the years.

When I was much younger, I started off reading 1D fanfiction on Wattpad and then on Quotev. I can't say I've really use them much in the last 5 years though. Especially since I stopped reading 1D stuff a long time ago. Their stories are usually childish and basic in my opinion. I really stick with FFN and can most of the time find a fanfiction with exactly what I'm looking for.
