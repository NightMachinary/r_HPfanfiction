I will always support AO3 with every fiber of my being, as a fandom content creator. They stand for the rights of fans to make transformative works and post them on the internet. Disney has been recently started handing out DMCAs to fan artists and creators and the legal team at AO3 is ready to defend the right to fan works in a physical court. Plus, if you've posted work on AO3, you are an equal recipient of a [[https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/11/18300639/ao3-fanfiction-hugo-awards-2019][Hugo Award]]. (Though no one individual writer is technically a winner of said Hugo Award so, unfortunately, you can't claim it on a resume.)
