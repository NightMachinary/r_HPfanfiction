Ao3 is great for specific searches but whay the fuck there is so much wacky porn on there for everything that you end up having to filter it all out or you have to bleach your eyes out. Sometimes weird shit gets through the cracks. You generally don't have to worry about that as much on ffn if you leave M off. Ffn can have more fics sometimes, ao3 probably has the better interface tho. Also ffn is good for just basic searches and browsing for stuff, I think it's quicker. Wattpad is where all the poorly written stuff by 12 year olds go lol. Legit nothing is spellchecker or grammatically correct there it's unreal
