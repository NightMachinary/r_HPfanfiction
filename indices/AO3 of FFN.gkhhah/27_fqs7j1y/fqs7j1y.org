Ffn has a /really/ great app. I keeps track of what I've read, and what I've downloaded to read in the future, easily organized into folders when I download it. It's the only reason I use it over ao3, which does indeed have a much better tag system for better searches. But I almost never use the search function on ffn because of the ability to easily browse other stories favorited by the author when I finish one. I never have to use the search function, I just scroll through the author's favorites and add 5 more stories to my list, and then more from those. Plus, after I finish one, the app itself will recommend a list of about 20, but their algorithm still needs little work ðŸ˜‚
