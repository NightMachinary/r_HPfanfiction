I prefer FFN for reading, because it's what I started on, I like the font and the category system. Not the biggest fan of the new mid-story ads though. Wattpad has the best users for posting - I have a WIP WBWL that's tropey and bad yet there are hundreds of comments complimenting the story and begging for updates.
