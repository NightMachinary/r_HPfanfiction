I read all the comments and no one mentioned my favorite features of AO3.... The bookmarkers notes and searching sections. I read on both AO3 & FFN. Started with FFN and read all i could in my favorite pairing then i found AO3 and read there. I have hundreds of stories saved on the 2 sites. I often find it hard to search for a particular story I want to read again if i can't remember the exact title. With AO3 when i bookmark a story i can add notes to remind me the details of a story and I can add my own tags so i can easily find bonding fics for example in case the author didn't actually tag it that way. FFN bookmarked stories has no filtering option. Overall i find AO3 more user friendly.
