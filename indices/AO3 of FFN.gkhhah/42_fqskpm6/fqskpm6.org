FFN is more intuitive and has a better sorting system. I like the asthetics of FFN better as well. Don't get me wrong, AO3 would far exceed FFN with sorting if authors were capable of using AO3's well developed system properly. I find that FFN has the higher quality stories as well. If I want a 400k poorly written slash fic with tags for everything ranging from Cute!Harry to Warning!Beastiality!, I'll go to AO3. If I'm on the hunt for the next gripping and original story, I'll head to FFN.
