Well, one problem I notice is that you've assumed the "&" symbol denotes a romantic relationship: it doesn't. When that symbol is used in tags it means a close platonic friendship.

As for filtering out slash pairings:

Unfortunately, just like on FFN, not all authors tag their fics correctly. Your best bet is to exclude M/M and then also exclude every specific pairing that you don't want. It may take a while to refine your filters, but afterwards you can save that results page as a browser bookmark in order to quickly reuse the same filters again in the future.
