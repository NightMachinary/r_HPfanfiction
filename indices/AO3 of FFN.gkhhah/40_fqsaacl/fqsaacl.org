I've used FFN for ages. The sheer quantity of posted stories means there's pretty much always something new that I'd give a try reading. The filtering means I can have a minimum amount of words, and can sort by favorites so there's somewhat of level of popularity/quality.

The numerous times I've tried Ao3, it seems like either I'm using it wrong, or the filtering just doesn't work. For example:

I exclude M/M => The first page is filled of Sirius Black/Remus Lupin, Harry Potter & Cedric Diggory, Harry Potter/Tom Riddle, Dudley Dursley & Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy & Harry Potter etc.

Am I expected to exclude every single specific pairing I'm not interested in?

+Also, how do I search for a specific crossover between 2 universes? I can drill into one. But I can't seem to find a way to add a 2nd one. I can choose "Show crossovers only", but that includes everything.+ Nevermind used the search instead of filter.

Pretty much at the end of every attempt I leave Ao3 frustrated and annoyed.
