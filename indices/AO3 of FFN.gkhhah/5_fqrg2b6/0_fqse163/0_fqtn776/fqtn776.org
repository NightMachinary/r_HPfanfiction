AO3 used to be invite-only -- iirc there was a waiting list for the public (I also have a vague recollection of a lottery), and members would get codes every now and again to distribute to their friends... or something along those lines. As these things tend to go with hobbies, good writers are usually friends with other good writers and so codes would spread rapidly within those social circles. I'm sure many BNFs were also given codes by virtue of their status -- somebody in the fandom would get them a code. Additionally, AO3 was started by some really good writers, so it got a bit of a jumpstart in that regard. But really, there isn't anything much at play aside from social dynamics and self-selection.
