I've noticed this as well, and I wonder why it is.

Fics on Ao3 and FFN are similar quality level at the top end of the spectrum, but the bottom end is much lower on FFN, with plenty of fics that are just wall-of-text or otherwise eye-meltingly bad grammar.

Is this because the userbase of Ao3 is older on average? Does Ao3 have a higher barrier-for-entry that keeps out the people who lack a certain baseline skill level?
