I don't have a strong preference for either. Whichever site has the stories, there I shall go. FF.net is older and has more of the classics linkffn(naked quidditch match). FF.net also has a better mobile app, arguably better UI, and feels better for looking through communities and recommendations. AO3, on the other hand, has a much better filtering system and actually links the sequels of multipart stories. Plus AO3 is a lot less squeamish about smut, which I can filter away anyway.

Right now, the features on AO3 are better, but I mostly get story recommendations for FFN, so I just go where the stories are. I'd prefer if authors published on both websites and readers linked to both websites, but I'll take what I can get.

On a philosophical note, I believe more strongly in AO3's core values (freedom of speech, openness, and tolerance) than FFN's (???, profit).

As for other sites, I go where recommendations point me. Nowadays other sites generally aren't popular enough to get linked a lot. Our resident link bot started off only linking from FFN before expanding to include AO3. I dunno if it includes other sites now.
