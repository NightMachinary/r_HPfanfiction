much prefer AO3 for its tag system, handy and easy-to-read layout and summary being on the chapters. can also read the entire work, create easier bookmarks and link to series'. FFN has some incredible 500k+ word plus stories though, which i will never tire of. some fics on FFN are unforgettable to me.
