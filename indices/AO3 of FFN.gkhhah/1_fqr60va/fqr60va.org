AO3 allows far better searches thanks to the tag system, it isn't censored by idiots (you can publish anything that's legal, not just anything prudes want to allow you to look at), it doesn't have ads, and it will never delete your story because some jerk reports it for something that isn't even there. It's got a much nicer UI in almost every respect, and is run by much better people. Indeed, the non-profit that runs it is committed to archiving and preserving fanworks and isn't going to suddenly delete anything ever. I would use it exclusively except that there are people who don't publish there, so I have to look at their stuff on FFN.
