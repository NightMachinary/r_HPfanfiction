Ao3 is the only one I can use anymore. Fanfiction net ,while I have fond memories of it, is sorely in need of an update to the design and the filter system. I have an account I made in 2011 but I never use it as theres so much bad fics to scroll through and the search filter isn't as good as Ao3's IMO.
