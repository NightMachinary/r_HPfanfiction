I 100% support this and the comments, but in this world I'm guessing that Hagrid is a bit smarter and not 110% Team Dumbledore. Because the only reason /Hagrid/ was sent, instead of, oh I don't know */McGonagall/* is because Dumbledore didn't WANT anyone noticing how neglected Harry is. And even if Hagrid /did/ notice, he 110% trusts Dumbledore and wouldn't /imagine/ him doing anything wrong.

Anyhoo, if anyone has written/found a fanfic for this, plz tell me! I'll definitely enjoy it =)

Edit: I honestly don't want to discuss this anymore but I was on tumblr and found the meta I was referencing and I decided to share it (and wait for the undoubted hate of many Potterheads who were/are very offended at my comment).
