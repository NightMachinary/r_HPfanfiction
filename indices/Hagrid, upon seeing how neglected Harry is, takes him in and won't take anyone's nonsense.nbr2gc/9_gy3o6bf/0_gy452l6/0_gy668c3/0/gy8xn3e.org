After a brief glance, Carnivorous Muffin sounds fucking insane. She claims the trio are all horrible people, that Dumbledore is a "raging misogynist" (???), and a whole load of other moronic things.

She's not "good" at explaining things. She sounds like an actual lunatic. Her reasoning for Dumbledore being a raging misogynist is that he viewed Lily's love as very powerful, and therefore he's horribly sexist against all women for praising a woman's femininity (love?).

Wtf?
