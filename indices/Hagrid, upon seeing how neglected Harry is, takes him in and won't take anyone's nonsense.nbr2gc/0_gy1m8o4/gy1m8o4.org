Perfect setup for a Beastmaster! Harry, where his affinity for dealing with creatures extends to basically everything. Baby dragon? I think you mean NEW BEST FRIEND! Basilisk? Dump down a heat lamp and wait for it to go to sleep under it. Acromantula? Bit too many of them here Hagrid, maybe move them to a heavily warded magical preserve and set up a silk business on the side. Another Dragon, but this one is nesting? Forfit the task, then go on a 3 hour rant to the organisers about how idiotic it is to put nesting dragons in and how this could have led to the deaths of several clutches of eggs. Have to be restrained from extreme violence once it's known that some of the eggs didn't make it.

Anyway, basically this.
