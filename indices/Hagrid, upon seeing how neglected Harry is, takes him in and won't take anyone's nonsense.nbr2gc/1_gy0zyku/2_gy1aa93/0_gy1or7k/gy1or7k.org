Whether Dumbledore used the Elder Wand to repair Hagrid's wand is debatable. It's strongly implied that he has them in pieces only. Olivander explicitly said "and you don't use the pieces, do you?" to Hagrid, implying you CAN work some kind of magic with them.

And even if I grant you that Hagrid has a working wand, human Transfiguration is NEWT/post-NEWT. It's the most advanced kind of Transfiguration that exists. Hagrid was expelled in his */third year/*. He only has three years of formal magical education. But he could put a pig tail on someone with Transfiguration. That's incredible. Either Hagrid has a great deal of magical talent, or he kept studying and practicing magic in secret. Possibly some combination of the two. He does, after all, have infinite access to the Hogwarts library. All year round.
