Dumbledore had a wand that fix broken wands and Hagrid that Dumbledore gave him permission to use magic while looking for Harry... that's not to say Hagrid is not skilled at magic considering he accomplishes all you said with not even three years of formal training and assuming he is not allowed to use magic, he'd normally be a little rusty.

As for the Legilimency part... for a real life explanation you might be right and it wasn't invented yet. However a simple in-universe explanation would be that it requires eye contact and Voldemort's face is covered by a turban (besides he says in GoF that in wraith form he only maintained the power of possession) and being that Hagrid is later proven to be pretty spell-resistant a failed Imperius or Confounding Charm could have exposed Quirrell.
