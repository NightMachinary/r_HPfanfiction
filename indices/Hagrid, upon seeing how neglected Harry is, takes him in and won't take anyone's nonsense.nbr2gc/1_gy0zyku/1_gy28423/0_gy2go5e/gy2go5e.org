Nah, he was great at taming creatures and bonding with them. But he was a shit teacher. The guy after the Buckbeak incident, wastes the entire year on Flobberworms. Starting that year with a hippogriff was also a mistake. It is a XXX creature that adults can handle; not 13 year olds. (Buckbeak attacking is Draco's fault)

Next year he takes two creatures and then crosses them, creating a new hybrid without the ministry's permission. He doesn't know anything about them, not their diets, behaviour etc. How did he think that teaching 14 year olds about them is a good idea? He wastes the entire year on them, except the nifflers and the unicorn foal class.

Grubbly-plank was a better teacher than Hagrid. Most students, except Harry's gang didn't like him as a teacher. Ravenclaws considered him a joke, including Luna. Even Harry knew that Grubbly-plank was a better teacher

IMO, Albus should have appointed Grubbly-plank, and if needed make Hagrid as a teaching assistant or something
