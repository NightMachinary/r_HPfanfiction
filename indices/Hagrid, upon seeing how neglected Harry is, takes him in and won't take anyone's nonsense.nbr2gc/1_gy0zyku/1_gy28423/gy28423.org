Please, if you decide to write this, tell us here. I'm pretty sure quite a few of us would absolutely love to read a story like that! Also I feel like people sometimes forget how good Hagrid is at training magical creatures despite that being one of his main jobs. It's stated in the books that he has the only tamed herd of thestrals in the entire UK, he managed to successfully tame a Cerberus, raised an acromantula while still a teenager, and got Grawp, a giant, a species typically known for fighting, violence, inter-species fighting, and brutality, to not only speak English, but also politely sit in a tuxedo at Dumbledore's funeral. I feel like that's the real reason Dumbledore always refused to fire Hagrid, the half-giant knew his job and did it better than anyone else ever could have.
