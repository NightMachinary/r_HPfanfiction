I've considered the idea before of having Harry be some sort of exotic dark creature, like something from the very worst sort of fanfiction, but instead of the story revolving around that, Hagrid immediately adopts him and won't let anyone interfere. So Harry just lives with Hagrid now, and that's the whole story. Harry living with Hagrid and Hagrid telling everybody else to bugger off. I intended it to be a deliberate subversion of the elder vampire quarter banshee nephilim incubus nonsense.

Still, there's merits to Hagrid just adopting Harry anyway without an excuse. I don't think I've ever seen it anywhere before. It might be an interesting excuse to go with some of the more unusual and underused ideas some people have thrown around, like the notion that Hagrid must actually be quite good at magic and quite good in a fight: he keeps the creatures in the forest at bay through fear of angering him, which means Hagrid is extremely dangerous when he wants to be. And he can manage partial human Transfigurations and mid-tier Charms with a */broken wand/*. We know good and well how hard having an unsuitable or broken wand can affect spellcasting; we have Neville for most of the books and Ron in second year as examples. Hagrid managed to put a pig tail on Dudley and regularly charms the pumpkin patches and Christmas trees with the snapped pieces of a wand encased inside an umbrella. That's actually kind of incredible. And others have also pointed out in various fics that Hagrid must be accomplished at Occlumency, because Dumbledore trusts him to keep secrets, and even Quirrelmort had to get him drunk and talking to learn what he wanted to know about Fluffy; they couldn't just pull it out of Hagrid's head.

Naturally, I think the real reason Legilimency wasn't used book 1 is because Rowling hadn't invented it yet, just like how Dumbledore flew to the Ministry on a broomstick because she hadn't invented apparation, the floo, or portkeys yet. But even so, canon must be retroactive for it to be valid, which means either Legilimency doesn't work on people with giant blood, or Hagrid actually knows Occlumency. For the purposes of a story, you could easily claim the latter over the former.

So there's potentially quite a bit of skills Harry could pick up from living with Hagrid. They actually compliment each other very well. Harry can actually cook, at least according to the fandom, while Hagrid is skilled at hunting and growing produce. The two of them working together would never want for good food. Hagrid could teach Harry how to fight, how to hunt, whatever tricks it is he's using to use advanced Transfigurations and Charms with a broken wand, and possibly Occlumency.

Harry could end up being quite the competent and dangerous teenager after a few years of Hagridization.

[EDIT]

The more I think about this, the more I want to write it. I've been trying to get back into writing by working on another project, but this really tickles my fancy. I might pick this up, if no one objects.
