I would 100% read this. Hagrid is underutilized in the Fandom. And it's clear he very much loves Harry. Also in addition to everything you said think about the Skewrts. Hagrid engineered an entirely new species of creature that is seemingly immune to magic can breathe fire and is extremely durable. Thats the sort of science that generally is done by someone with multiple P.H.Ds. it's not like it's a simple crossbreed. And he did this while doing his 2 jobs at hogwarts because he didn't stop being Groundskeeper when he became a teacher. So, kinda makes you wonder if Dumbledore sent Hagrid isn't because Dumbledore is incompetent like some fanfic suggest but because he literally can't think of anyone safer. Best of all, Hagrid being powerful is a secret between him and Dumbledore. A secret weapon so to speak for if Dumbledore falls.
