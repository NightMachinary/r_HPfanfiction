The setting is almost 100% Amestris. There's a few things different with how the nation was created (had to get the four founders in somewhere!), but all the locations-- Resembool, Central City, Eastern Command, Lior, Ishval, etc-- the gang's all here.

The characters are Harry Potter, mostly. Because of the different setting, characters have had different experiences and therefore slightly different character traits. There are also characters from HP that graph very well onto characters from FMA, which I take advantage of. Certain groups of characters-- the Ishvalans, the Homunculi, the Briggs soldiers-- still exist, but have the HP characters grafted onto them, sometimes in surprising ways. So no, none of the major FMA characters will be appearing.

And thus, the plot. Both FMA and HP have such tight storytelling and are built to work around the characters and world building that each created. To take one's setting and the other's characters means that to create a wholly new plot unrelated to the narratives of either would be very difficult. So, I'm taking elements of FMA, FMA 2003, and HP that I like, throwing them in a blender, and seeing what comes out. :)
