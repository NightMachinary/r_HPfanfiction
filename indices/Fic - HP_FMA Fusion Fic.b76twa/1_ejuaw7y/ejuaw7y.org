I tend to prefer crossovers where the two fandoms are separate(is there a singular word for this?) to fusion ones, but there's been a couple fusions I've liked so I'll give it a shot.

Out of curiosity is it mostly HP plot and characters with FMA setting/world? IE no FMA Homunculi, Van Hohenheim, Elric Brothers, etc, or are those also present?
