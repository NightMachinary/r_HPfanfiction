I'm gonna assume we're discussing the fictional band members here, Murdoc, 2D, Noodle, and Russel.

First off Murdoc. He's easily the loudest personality amongst the band mates, being brash and uncouth. However he'd also be rather terrifying to a young child, utterly lacking in personal hygiene and boundaries. At best, he'd be considered the crazy uncle. At worst, the violent cousin that likes to torture pets.

Second is 2D. He's shown to be rather timid with a dependency on Murdoc, that may or may not be Stockholm syndrome. He doesn't seem to have any agency over his own actions, relying almost entirely on Murdoc to tell him what to do. However, he is a very gentle soul, which leads me to believe that his interactions with a young Harry would primarily be positive, perhaps singing for to him when he's young and later introducing him to music once he's older.

Next is Russel. He's become somewhat vacant after being possess by his dead friends, despite being an incredible musician. I tend to see him as functioning somewhat in autopilot, typically being given a task and then focusing on that task to the exclusion of all else. Having a young child practically dropped into his lap, said child would most likely become his focus. I think he'd very much be a gentle giant caretaker for Harry, insuring Harry is fed, bathed, and being his staunchest protector.

Lastly we have Noodle. Personally I think she'd be Harry's biggest influence growing up with the band. She's loud, wild, determined, and energetic. I think young Harry would be drawn to her spirit and vitality, especially if he'd spent any time prior with the Dursleys. I think with Harry as her main example he'd learn to have fun and not let anyone push him or anyone else around(she is a super soldier). However, with how frequently she wanders off or gets separated from the group in general, indeed with how often the entire group is separated, the biggest concern is who Harry would end up with. Typically I think 2D has the most stable life after the band parts for however long, and Harry would end up with him.

So personally I think Harry would still be sorted into Gryffindor, based on Noodle's influence, however it would be tempered with 2D's gentleness. A fun loving, adventurous Harry with Hufflepuff loyalty, but also intelligent and not afraid to fight(again Noodle is a super soldier). Also he'd play at least four instruments.
