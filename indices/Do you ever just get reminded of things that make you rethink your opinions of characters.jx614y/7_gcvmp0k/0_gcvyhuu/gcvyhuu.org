I mean Voldemort also like split his soul a shit ton of times im not sure how well that mind works.

But more importantly you don't really see him getting outs .The way Snape you see Lilly giving him chances the benefit of the doubt a way out a different choice and he repeatedly doesn't take it. Maybe Voldemort had it too. But you don't see it Snape you do and then see him reject it.
