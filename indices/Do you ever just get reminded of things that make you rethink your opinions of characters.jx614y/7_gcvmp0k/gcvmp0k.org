i think this happens with for voldemort, like he's voldemort, evil bastard murderer master manipulator. but i think of the whole family situation and it's fucking sad and totally fucked up. so i got a bit of sympathy for the devil, but that's how it's meant to be.

interestingly i can't like snape in anyway despite his tragic back story aha, i just hate that man and how jkr used it as a poor plot twist. voldemort is just better written ig.
