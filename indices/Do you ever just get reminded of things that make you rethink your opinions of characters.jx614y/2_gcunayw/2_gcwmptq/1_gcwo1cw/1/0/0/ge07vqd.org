I really think it's a matter of opinion and perspective

I have also seen people lose family friends, spouses, etc. and the truth is that in the cases that I have seen many times, the situation has ended in depressions at extreme levels and with psychological and even physical emotional exhaustion (I have seriously seen people go through from being young brimming with life to aging 10 years or more in a few months and believe me I'm not exaggerating)

I have also of course seen people recover from these situations but a pattern that I have noticed in people who manage to overcome depression is that they had something to lean on, for example a person who had lost his spouse who had small children and although it was noticeable who had not gotten over his loss was recovered thanks to his sense of responsibility and love for his children and knowing what they needed from their father when they had already lost their mother or people who rely on their parents or their brothers and things like that

But in Lily's case I don't think she would have that motivational lever that would give her the strength to get out of depression (at least not a positive one) What we know about her is that her parents are dead before that night in which she and James They were attacked by Voldemort we also know that her sister hated her to the point of pretending she had no sister and from the letter she sent to Sirius and Alastor Moody's stories about the Order of the Phoenix we know that the Death Eaters were massacring the companions and / or friends of Lily not to mention that in this hypothetical scenario the war would continue as cruel as ever since Voldemort has not been defeated

So I think Lily's motivation to get ahead would probably become personal revenge against Voldemort and most likely against snape if she ever finds out about his involvement in all this

I also agree with you that snape's feelings for Lily were more than just an obsession for her and that since we have both agreed, his biggest problem was not understanding Lily's personality or emotions, but still again I think which is something of perspective because I do not think it is a bad thing to try to keep someone you love alive but as I have already told you before, I have met people in depressive situations due to having lost a loved one and it is really sad and exhausting to see them die slowly because that's what they're doing

I think that in the end, snape would regret his wish because I think that the course that Lily would take from this traumatic event would be something very sad and heartbreaking for all those who love her. whether she is filled with hatred or gradually wears out. (like winky and trelawney who got drunk)
