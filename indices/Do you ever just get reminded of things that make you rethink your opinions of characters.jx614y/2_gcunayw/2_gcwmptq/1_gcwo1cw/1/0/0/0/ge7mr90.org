It would be interesting to read a fic that deals with how Lily handles a situation like that. I could see her and Sirius finding solace/comfort in each other either as platonic friends or maybe it becoming something more. Sirius would feel terribly guilty for convincing James to use Peter as secret keeper, and he definitely wouldn't abandon Lily to wallow in loneliness and grief after the fact. At that point they'd actually have a lot in common, with both of their families either estranged or dead. Maybe they'd team up to kill Peter and try to take down Voldemort. Or maybe Lily would talk Sirius down from doing something rash.
