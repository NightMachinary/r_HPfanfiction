Oh I agree he was very emotionally disconnected. If he really understood what she valued, he would have never joined Voldemort or called her that nasty word. She was absolutely right to enforce her boundaries and cut ties with him when she did, because he was heading down a very bad path.

I just never read his pleas with Voldemort as wanting to save her as a trophy or anything. Just that he did still genuinely care for his childhood friend and didn't want her to die. He didn't care about the guy who bullied him, and either didn't care about Harry or didn't think he could convince Voldemort to not kill who Volds believed was the literal child of prophesy destined to kill him, so Snape tried to settle for convincing Voldemort to spare the mother who was just a bystander from Voldemort's point of view.

I also don't think someone whose feelings were simply possessive/obsessive would have experienced the change in patronus that Snape did. To me that's evidence that regardless of how well he understood her, he did care as much as he had capacity for at that point in his life.

Even if Lily had survived and stayed cut off from Snape/hated his guts forever/whatever I don't agree that keeping her alive would have no meaning for him. To him it would mean that she hadn't been murdered. I don't know if you have ever lost a friend to murder. It's the kind of awful I can't really articulate in words. And maybe having experienced that, allows me to sympathize with Snape just wanting her to not be dead.

And actually, that may have been what allowed Lily's ancient love protection stuff to save Harry. Voldemort did tell her to stand aside several times. Lily could have made the choice to live through the attack. She refused and /chose/ to die to protect Harry. If Voldemort had just come in with intent to kill all the Potters and took her out immediately, I don't think her death would have given Harry any magical protection.

Also, I find the idea that potential emotional pain makes someone's life not worth saving highly disturbing. I've lived through some pretty horrifying things. There have been moments I wish I hadn't, but most days I'm glad to be alive. I'm glad that someone intervened after a really traumatic assault and saved my life. They didn't look at my broken person and say, "welp, this one's too broken and is going to suffer too much after this. Might as well let her die." Lots of people in the world have lost children, spouses, other close family members, endured genocides, terrible abuse, and that doesn't make their lives worth less, or less worth living. Yes Lily would have certainly suffered, but she was written as a strong willed and resilient woman who would gone on to live her best life somehow. People who survive have the chance to heal from their trauma too.
