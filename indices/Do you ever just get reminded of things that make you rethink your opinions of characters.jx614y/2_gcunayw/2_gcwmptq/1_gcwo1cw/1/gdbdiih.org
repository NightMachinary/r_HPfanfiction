That still seems very disturbing to me even if his intention was not to monopolize her for himself because for me the simple fact of wanting to keep her alive without considering her personal wishes tells me that snape did not have the slightest understanding of Lily's personality.

Just think about it for a moment, what if Voldemort took his promise to Snape more seriously and the moment Lily decides not to pull away he faints or paralyzes her or something and proceeds to kill Harry? Can you imagine the massive emotional and mental damage that Lily would suffer? As readers, we can feel more or less pleased by James or Harry, but Lily's position was very clear about it, for her they were her husband and son for whom she had a great love and she demonstrated it effusively in several scenes , so there are two options

snape is aware of all this and still doesn't care and his greatest wish is to keep Lily alive as a trophy or snape is unaware of this which would show how emotionally disconnected they are from each other to the point where they are probably Lily already considered snape a stranger at this time so his desire to keep her alive would be devoid of any meaning since at this point their relationship would have become completely one-sided
