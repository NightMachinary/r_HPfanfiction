Harry naming his kid after Albus i can understand, even though he enabled thr abuse he suffered during his childhood. Snape however shouldnt be given the same consideration, he pointed the gun at his and his parents lives and only deflevted knowing Lily were targeted, not only thst but hr continues to verbally abuse the other orphan he's partislly responsible for in Neville.

Snapes redemption wad undeserved, Harry naming his kid after him spits on the graves of Lily and James.
