Wasn't Nevilles Boggart Snape tho?

Like, to have your literal WORST FEAR be your teacher goes beyond shaming or docking points, dude. He was flat out abusive and abused his power, too. Didn't he also threaten to feed a botched potion to Neville's road? Yeah, that's not shaming or docking points, it's well beyond that.
