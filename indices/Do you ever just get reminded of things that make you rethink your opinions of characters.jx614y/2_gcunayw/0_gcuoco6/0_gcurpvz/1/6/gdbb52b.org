Ok to start with, when people say that snape really protected Harry what exactly do they mean?

Unless I'm forgetting about something important I think the only thing sniape did that was worthy of Harry was protecting him during a Quidditch match where they wanted to kill him and give him the gryffindor sword in the seventh book

although it is true that both things are important some people act as if they had been decisive in the future of events I think that if Harry had been in danger and snape was not there dumbledore could still protect him and the gryffindor sword could have been given to Harry in other ways

Furthermore, people seem to be deliberately ignoring the fact that Harry nearly died many times throughout his entire school life and that most of those times he had to save himself or was saved by other people than snape so I think these people should receive the same recognition if not even more than snape for keeping Harry alive

And about bullying it is true that snape was abused by the marauders in his school years that I will not deny but honestly, I would not rush to call him a victim, why? because of this

Lily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently arguing. Harry hurried to catch up with them, to listen in. As he reached them, he realized how much taller they both were. A few years seemed to have passed since their Sorting.

"...thought we were supposed to be friends?" Snape was saying, "Best friends?"

*"We are, Sev, but I don't like some of the people you're hanging round with! I'm sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he's creepy! D'you know what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?"*

*Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face.*

*"That was nothing," said Snape. "It was a laugh, that's all--"*

*"It was Dark Magic, and if you think that's funny--"*

Apparently, even though Snape received harassment and intimidation from the marauders, he still had a good view of his friends abusing other students even using dark magic and he categorized those actions as "just a laugh", so I honestly don't think he was exactly what people would call "innocent" other than the fact that he called all Muggleborns besides Lily Mudblood.
