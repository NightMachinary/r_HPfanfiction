  The worse Snape did to Harry as Neville was get them targeted by Voldemort which got there parents killed and tortured then mock them for it in class you mean.\\
  He was a pathetic BULLY TORTURER AND MURDER along with his death eater friends. Snape is one of the main reasons Harry is an orphan and Neville s parents got tortured

The prophecy was relayed before Harry and Neville were born. Snape didn't know that it concerned Lily or the Longbottoms. That's why he went to Dumbledore to ask him to protect them.

And if you wanna talk about murder, don't forget that Sirius and James almost got him killed. James only prevented it to save his skin and safe Remus from being sent to Askaban.
