The fact that he didn't know which baby was going to be killed doesn't make it better in the slightest. The prophecy makes it pretty clear that a baby is the target, and he passed that information onto his genocidal boss. End of story. He found out the information that would get said genocidal boss killed, decided he didn't want his genocidal boss killed, and said instead that his boss should kill the baby. I never understand what the argument here is.
