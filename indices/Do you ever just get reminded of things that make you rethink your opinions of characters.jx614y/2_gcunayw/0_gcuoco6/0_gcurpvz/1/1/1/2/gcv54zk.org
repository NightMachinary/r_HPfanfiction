So?

He knew Voldemort. He knew Voldemort would want to kill that baby, whoever he was. He could have shut his mouth. No one knew that he had overheard the prophecy. He had no obligtion, not even coercion to share it with Voldemort.

He only changed his mind because Lily became a target. That's it. That why he went to Dumbledore. He asked for Lily to be protected. He didn't ask for Harry and James to be protected. They were afterthgouths, at best bones for Harry protection.

We can argue that Snape was only 19, and things weren't real for him. And it's when someone he knew was targeted that he realised how bad it actually was. Like a "oh fuck, that's not a video game" kind of thing.

This, I can happily debate, and consider, and discuss.
