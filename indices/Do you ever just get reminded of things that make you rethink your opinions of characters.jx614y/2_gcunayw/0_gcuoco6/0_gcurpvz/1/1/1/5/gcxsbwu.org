  Snape didn't know that it concerned Lily or the Longbottoms. That's why he went to Dumbledore to ask him to protect them.

What if it didn't? So you're telling that if Voldemort didn't target Lily, then Snape wouldn't have defected. He went to Dumbledore /only/ because Voldemort was going to kill the Potters. He probably wouldn't bat an eye if it was some other family. You are not really helping your case.
