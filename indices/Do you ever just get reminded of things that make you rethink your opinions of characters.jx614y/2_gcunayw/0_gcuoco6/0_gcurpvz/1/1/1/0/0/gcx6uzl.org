Ok, so, I agree with you for the most part- but the prophecy doesn't state how old the person its talking about is?\\
'Approaches' (Prophecy, first sentence)= Yeah, could be talking about birth, but could easily mean someone not nearby /approaching/ the area.\\
'Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies'= Everybody is born. Age isn't a factor here.\\
'Will be born' (Prophecy, last line)= Now, this is the point where I sat back and thought 'huh, /does/ it make it clear it's talking about someone not born yet?' But the answer is no! Looking at the context, /the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord/ is what precedes that. This means this line could be referring to someone who is already born, and even possibly old, but only develops the power to defeat Voldemort now. However, even with all that, Snape only heard and delivered the first half of the prophecy to Voldemort, so h wouldn't of even heard the 'will be born' line.
