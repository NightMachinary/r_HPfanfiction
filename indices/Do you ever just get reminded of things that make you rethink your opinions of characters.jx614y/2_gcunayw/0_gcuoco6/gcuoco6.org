Oh ya I agree. I just usually headcanoned that he changed to be maybe less stalkerish overtime. Like say during his death. But this is from memories he gave Harry to show what happened but also to show how he felt and feels for her. And knowing that he tore the picture and letter and is showing those memories as a expression of his feelings in his last moments makes me think he didn't change as much as I generally assume.

Like I know Snape is supposed to be ambiguous as a character. But alot of that ambiguity came from these memories he had. These are the memories that led to Harry naming a kid after him. But honestly these kinda make him look worse. Because it was a blur to me I just assumed these memories made him look good because of the epilogue. But the more I remember or get reminded the more I rethink that assumption.
