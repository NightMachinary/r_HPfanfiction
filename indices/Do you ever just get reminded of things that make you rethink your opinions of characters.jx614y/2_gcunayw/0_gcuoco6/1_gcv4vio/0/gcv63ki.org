/And next, Snape was kneeling in Sirius's old bedroom. Tears were dripping from the end of his hooked nose as he read the old letter from Lily. The second page carried only a few words: could ever have been friends with Gellert Grindelwald. I think her mind's going, personally!/

/Lots of love, Lily/

/Snape took the page bearing Lily's signature, and her love, and tucked it inside his robes. Then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding, so that he kept the part from which Lily laughed, throwing the portion showing James and Harry back onto the floor, under the chest of drawers/

Thats the passage he was for sure emotional and not sure if he had pictures of her definitely possible he didn't. But to me it reads as removing her and "her love" from the context she wanted it in. Which feels a bit wrong to me personally.

I guess it kinda comes down more to who you feel for here Snape or Lilly and I guess I just feel more for Lilly ðŸ˜…
