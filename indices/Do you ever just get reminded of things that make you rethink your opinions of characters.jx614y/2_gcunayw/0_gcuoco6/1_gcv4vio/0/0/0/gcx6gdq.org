It's one of those things where you've got to think like... what if someone had done that with someone I love that had died? What if some dude that bullied me all through my school life ripped a photo of my nan holding me when I was a baby to keep the part of her, and removed a closing portion to a letter sending her love to someone she cared about, PURELY because they were â€˜in love with her since they were young' but never actually dated her?

I don't know about you but I'd be pretty mad and creeped out tbh
