I never said that the Marauders were saints, also jealous teenagers won't think logically, also first impression gone haywire with them between James/Sirius/Snape so there it goes. But canonically it was never explored what went down with them, yes we know the Marauders bullied him but Snape wanted to get Lupin expelled for being a werewolf (which Dumbledore knew already tho). Yes Sirius almost murdered him or turned him into a werewolf but as I said, we never heard what Snape did and how he behaved, also it is possible that he would make friends with Slytherins I mean he was part of that house and spent majority of his time with them.
