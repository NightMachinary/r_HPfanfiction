  What if some dude that bullied me all through my school life
#+end_quote

Someone that /I/ bullied constantly, leading to him retaliating. Someone that my bullying eventually lead to him getting estranged from his only friend, the only think that brought some semblance of light into his childhood. Don't forget that James and the Marauders were grade A bullies as far as Snape is concerned. They basically ruined his school years which lead to enough trauma to last a lifetime.
