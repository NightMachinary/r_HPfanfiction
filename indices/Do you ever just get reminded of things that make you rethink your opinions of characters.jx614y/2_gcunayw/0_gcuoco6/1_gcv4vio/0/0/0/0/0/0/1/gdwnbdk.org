He is basically just as biased source on Snape as Snape is on Sirius and the other Marauders. I figure there's a exaggerated truth on both sides but we never get the context to know. So I'd say yes the Marauders did fuck with Snape and made his life miserable and take Snape at face value. But Snape and his friends ( which its confirmed he was friends with future Death Eaters at the time he was being harrased by the Marauders) did the same to the Marauders and others ( its confirmed the friend group harrased others and Snape was openly bigoted but not clear if he joined in the harassment). Unfair if I took Snape at face value and not Sirius so ill do both.
