I mean that's super stalkerish and creepy, even if you don't believe the "taking affection she didn't offer" argument above, he's literally cutting out all the parts that apply to other people and only keeping her....I mean I don't really care if he didn't have any pictures of her...that is obsessive stalkerish behavior there, it's also kinda delusional. I really can't feel sorry for him at all honestly. Creepy as hell
