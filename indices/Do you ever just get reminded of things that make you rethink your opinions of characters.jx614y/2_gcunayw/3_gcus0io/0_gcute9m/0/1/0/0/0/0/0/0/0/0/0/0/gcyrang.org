Nah I feel you I feel like people connect very strongly to the whole being/bullied/mocked/made fun of. Which makes sense.

But they relate so strongly to that aspect that they want to dismiss the flaws Snape has. The bigotry the support of genocide the creepy stalker thing he has of Lilly.

And if you haven't been on the receiving ends of that sort of thing but you have been on the receiving end of person who acts a bit like James then its easier I think to emphasize how bad what James did was but dismiss what Snape did more. It I think more a universal feeling. You know the people who are kinda douchey the James was in that scene. And you probably don't know many who did similar things to Snape.

But Snape joined a hategroup to start a genocide. He did so as a adult the bullying did not make him join that group. He was supportive of that group despite the fact that his friend who he claimed to love was a muggleborn who would be a target for that hate group's ideology. And he continued to be actively supportive of that hategroup as a adult. He didn't even switch sides because he stopped believing what they did.

So James was flawed but from what little you know of him he didn't do anything near as bad as Snape. You also know he was 15 then there was time to change. Most adults are way different than when they were 15 and you only get one memory so its hard to really say what he was like. Snape you have several memories and actually get to know him during his time at hogwarts so there much less ambiguity here.

Though to be fair Snape was a cruel teacher/authority figure in a way that is maybe more universal. You might have had teachers who feel a bit like that. So its not as if his brand of awfulness is always one that you aren't as used to. Which is more true for say Bellatrix or Voldemort. Which is why you might end up hating Umbridge way more than say Voldemort even though Voldemort has done worse things.

But for Snape though I think its overshadowed by how awful Umbridge was in book 5. In book 6 you are preoccupied by other things way more so Snapes behavior may not stand out as much. Plus after Umbridge it might not feel as bad. Finally in book 7 you aren't in school. So alot of the awful aspects of Snape that feel more grounded in experiences you've personally had ( the asshole teacher) Is less a part of the story in the last 3 books. I think that had a impact too.
