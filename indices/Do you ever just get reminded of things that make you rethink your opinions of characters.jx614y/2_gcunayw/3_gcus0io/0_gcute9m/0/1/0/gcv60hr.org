I think James and Sirius was closer to good than anything else, based on McGonagall impression of them.

McGonagall is incredibly fair and easy to displease. I don't think she would paint James as a good man as she did if he really was that awful.

And I truly feel that the bullying incident is blown out of proportion by fans.

Out of context, it is horrible.

But in the context where everyone did it, to the point that you feel like everyone had seen everyone underwear thanks to this hex throw around all the time, well it's not that extreme. At least it doesn't speak of the perprepetor characters as much as fans seems to think it does.
