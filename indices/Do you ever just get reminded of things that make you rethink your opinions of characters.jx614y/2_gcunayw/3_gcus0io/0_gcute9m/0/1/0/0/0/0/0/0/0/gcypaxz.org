James was completly diffrent from Draco, he judged what you were instead of who, James is the opposite.

James befriended a werewolf, a guy from at max a middle class in Peter and Sirius who was constantly at odds with the beliefs his family held.

Draco cares about bloodstatus and not your personality, James couldnt care less about blood status, but who you are as a person matters more, eg Lupun, Peter, Sirius and Lily.

Don't compare them, Draco at the age of 12-13(year 2) advocated for extermination of an entire demographic, simply due to them being born from non magical parents.
