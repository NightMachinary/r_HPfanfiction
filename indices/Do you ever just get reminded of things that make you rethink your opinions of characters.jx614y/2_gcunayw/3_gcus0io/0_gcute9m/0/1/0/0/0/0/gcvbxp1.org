I think it was actually the 80s?

I mean yes we should be less harsh with teens I don't think they didn't think this was bad. I do think they maybe didn't think it was as bad as they would have today but they were doing this to fuck with him and humiliate him.

But to be clear we don't know

if they did this alot,

or If it was always this one sided on either end.

If this scene came after scenes where Snape + friends teamed up and did something similar to say Sirius then this scene would read very differently.

And there's no way to really say for sure either way . Lupin says it was more a back and forth but maybe he was trying to save face or maybe it was the truth.

Levicorpus is way less dangerous than sectumsempra which Snape does attack James with I assumed since he got that cut when Snape attacked. Or at the very least he used something that drew blood. But it would now be unfair to say Snape was more murderous based on that one scene.

It out of context and we know so little bout James that we can't really make a good judgement either way.

it pretty down to how you feel about James based on nothing but intuition.

My personal headcanon was that it was more of a back and forth. The Marauders had been ganged up on Snape and his friends just as much. Both saw the other as monsters. Marauders I do think hated him and felt justified hating them for being wannabe wizard Nazis because you find out that Snape + friends being considered that wasn't really a secret.
