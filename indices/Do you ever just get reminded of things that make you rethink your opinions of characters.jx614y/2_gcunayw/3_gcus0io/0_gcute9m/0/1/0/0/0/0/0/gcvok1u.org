You last paragraph make me things that James was Draco with Gryffindor values.

They're two side of the same coins. Both are only child adored by their parents, coming from a rich pureblood family.

Both are arrogant, brillant, and popular among their house, and supported by their friends.

Both are good at Quidditch and like to show it. (Draco does buy his place on Slytherins Quidditch team, but Harry notices that Draco know how to fly).

Both are pretty prejudiced and enjoy tourmating who they are prejudiced again and think are lesser than them.

And both took a level in maturity in their last two years in Hogwarts. And both seems to stop harrassing other students and fooling around, and started to focuse on their choosen missions.

Likely because they both discovered that the real world is harsh. Draco throught Voldemort's punishment, and seeing first hand the reality of being a Death Eaters.

I believe James was when Sirius ran from home, and likely explained more about his parents and his family. Or it was because he was at the age when you notice a bit more the outside world and what is going on there. Or something else happened, maybe someone close to his family got killed by Death Eaters. We don't know what happened, but something happened.

Key differences are that Draco is on the Dark side, so he is prejudiced against not pure-bloods, and would merely attack them. James is prejudiced against Slytherins, and would attack them.

There's also the fact that Draco hate people for what they are, and James for what they believe in.

Which make a big differences in how one would view James, since as you said it feels more justified to attack people who are nazis than people from a minority.

But in the end, My headcanon is that Draco and James were the same kind of kids and early teenagers, with opposite values and views.
