Id argue that hating a oppressive group for being oppressive is not the same as hating the opposition.

  There's also the fact that Draco hate people for what they are, and James for what they believe in.

That I think makes them inherently different. .

Though of course not to say Draco couldn't change become more like James.

But ya you could argue they could have been similar personality wise. I wouldn't be opposed to that interpretation. Though I do think Draco may care more about being popular than James. I don't think he'd be friends with Remus or Pettigrew if he did.
