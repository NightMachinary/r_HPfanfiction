I had to go back look at the 5th book scene and yup he definitely tries to make a deal with her.

/'I will if you go out with me, Evans,' said James quickly. 'Go on ... go out with me and I'll never lay a wand on old Snivelly again.'/

Which she of course refuses .

/'I wouldn't go out with you if it was a choice between you and the giant squid,' said Lily./

I would say it wasn't that serious a deal given Sirius's reaction but thats kinda up to interpretation. Suggesting it at all is pretty fucked up though.

'/Bad luck, Prongs,' said Sirius briskly, and turned back to Snape./

But that's not why James threatens to hex her.

The spell on Snape wears off so he attacks Janes with a spell (which I always assumed was sectumsempra).

/But too late; Snape had directed his wand straight at James; there was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of James's face, spattering his robes with blood./

So then James puts back up with Levicorpus. Lilly demands Snape be put down. James does then Sirius puts him under another spell.

/James whirled about: a second flash of light later, Snape was hanging upside-down in the air, his robes falling over his head to reveal skinny, pallid legs and a pair of greying underpants./

/Many people in the small crowd cheered; Sirius, James and Wormtail roared with laughter./

/Lily, whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as though she was going to smile, said, 'Let him down!'/

/'Certainly,' said James and he jerked his wand upwards; Snape fell into a crumpled heap on the ground. Disentangling himself from his robes he got quickly to his feet, wand up, but Sirius said, 'Petrificus Totalus!' and Snape keeled over again, rigid as a board./

Lilly who has had enough probably at this point pulls out her own wand. Its at that point James threatens to her her completely unrelated to the date which at this point is off the table completely forgotten.

/'LEAVE HIM ALONE!' Lily shouted. She had her own wand out now. James and Sirius eyed it warily./

/'Ah, Evans, don't make me hex you,' said James earnestly./

/'Take the curse off him, then!'/

/James sighed deeply, then turned to Snape and muttered the counter-curse./

At which point Snape uses the slur and ruins their friendship forever.

/'I don't need help from filthy little Mudbloods like her!'/

/Lily blinked./

/'Fine,' she said coolly. 'I won't bother in future. And I'd wash your pants if I were you, Snivellus.'/

And as Lilly is leaving you hear James threatening to take his pants off.

So yes to trying to leverage Snape against her for a date. No for trying to hex her to make her date him.

Now I'm not suggesting here that James's actions are ok. But I really need context for them. Is this the norm for him? Was this the worst thing he ever did? Was it always like this one sided? Or did Snape and friends harass the Marauders in the same way or similar ways? Did James get better?

Lupin suggested he and Snape never stopped really throwing spells at each other but was it all like this or did it tone down to more minor?

I need a bit more to get what he was like.

Very honestly James could have done alot of things and depending on what he did, why he did it, and what changed about him I'd have different opinions about him. Theres alot of directions he could go within the constraints of what little you know. People change alot teens change alot. The people I know now who I knew in high-school are nothing like what they were in high-school. They might as well be a different person. I'd need more info more context to figure out James.

But you don't really get that context. You don't even get a general idea or trend like with Snapes memories which can get you a better idea of both Snape and Lilly.

This one is just one memory. And everything else? What you would need more of to get an actual idea of who James Potter was when he died? Or even who he was in school after that point? Its just whatever you would prefer because you have no real context. So even as bad as this memory is id say not it not really enough to figure him out he's too vague a character in canon. I wish I saw more of him in book canon too.
