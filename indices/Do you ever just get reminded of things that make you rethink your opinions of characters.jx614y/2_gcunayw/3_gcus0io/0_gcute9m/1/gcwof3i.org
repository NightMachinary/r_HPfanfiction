What squicks me out about James is how in Snape's worst memory, he was literally holding the physical wellbeing of Lily's male friend hostage to try and coerce her into a date with him.

When Lily refused, James threatened her physical safety. Like he threatened to hex her for not agreeing to go on a date.

Then when Snape said that gross slur and she left, it's heavily implied James took off his underwear in front of the school, which however you want to spin it is a sexual assault.

What Harry saw in that memory affected him so deeply he worried that his dad had coerced Lily in marrying him. That's pretty freaking terrible. I wish we saw more of how James had grown and changed as a person because it would have had to be pretty freakin' dramatic to come back from that and become a decent adult.
