You see one memory not even a series of memories to know like what the trend line was like you do with Snape and Lilly. Was this super excessive? The usual? A response to something big that happened before? Just a Tuesday?

No idea its all very up to interpretation. And how you interpret will drastically change the characterization but still works in canon because of how little you know about James

The he just did it to protect his friends is certainly a interpretation and def the one Snape believes but you lack the info to know how right or wrong he is.

James like I said is really ambiguous. It all comes down to how you wanna characterize him.
