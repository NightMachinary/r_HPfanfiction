  I can't I don't think James is so fucking vague in the books.

But we do see from Snape's memories that James Potter was a bully though.

And memories are far better since they are actual proof, they showed what occured.

James Potter might have treated people he knew and who were "gryffindor" much better than he treated others. That's why we hear such good things about him from Hagrid.

But that doesn't excuse the fact that he was a bully. And the whomping willow incident, he just did that to save his skin and to protect his friends.
