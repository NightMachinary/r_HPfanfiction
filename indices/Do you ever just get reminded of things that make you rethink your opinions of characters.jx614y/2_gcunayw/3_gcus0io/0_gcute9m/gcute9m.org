I can't I don't think James is so fucking vague in the books.

Like you know he bullied Snape in that memory but you don't know if it was one-sided or a back and forth like what Sirius and Lupin say. Was this just exceptionally one sided? Was it ever the other way around with one Marauder vs Snape + friends? You got no idea.

You know he disliked dark magic, people biased against muggleborns and was not fond of Slytherin tho not how intense any of it was.

You know Lilly didn't like him for a while but then did but you don't know what changed.

You know he saved Snape from like Lupin but you don't know why ( was it he didn't want Snape to be killed? Was it he didn't want Lupin to get in trouble?)

You he was pretty rich and well off and was smart and had good grades and was innovative.

And you know his last moments.

But that leaves like alot of ambiguity and alot of different ways to interpret and characterize him from mostly awful to mostly great and still be cannonically accurate.

I guess I the most that could happen is for there to be a super good or super evil depiction of James and I'd say that can't be canon and then realize shit it could be from what little you know.

In all fairness Lilly is in the same boat. Limited moments and all like speaking lines she gets are from memories of someone who is pretty biased towards her. If she had major character flaws you won't be seeing them in the memories Snape gives to Harry. But like...well at least you get more memories.
