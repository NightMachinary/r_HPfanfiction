Nah fam this isn't it. There is literally no proof of that in the books. The only piece of James we actively see is from his school rival (who, by the way, wasn't some cowering flower. Canon explicitly says he gave back as good as he got), which shows him in the worst light possible. Contrast this to the vast amount of beloved characters who talk about all his good qualities.

The whole thing about Lily being “the one thing his lineage or parents couldn't give him” is just nonsense. There's nothing in the books or canon to support that. What canon DOES show is that James grew up and matured enough to become Head Boy and form a genuine relationship with Lily built of mutual respect.

You don't have to like a character but please don't just go around acting like your headcanons are what actually happened in the books
