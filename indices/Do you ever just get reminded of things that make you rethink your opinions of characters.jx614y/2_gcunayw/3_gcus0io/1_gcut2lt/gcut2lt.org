James Potter was also obsessed with Lily Evans, he was just better at making it look funny and was better at charming women than Snape. He was a spoilt brat who viewed Lily as a goal/prize to achieve, the one thing his lineage or parents couldn't give him. If he truly fell in love with her during his attempts to woo her, that i do not know.
