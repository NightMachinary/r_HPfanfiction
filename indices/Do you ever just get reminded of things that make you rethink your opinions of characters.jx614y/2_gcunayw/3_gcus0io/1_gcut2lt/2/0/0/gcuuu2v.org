When did you see him obsessing over her? You know he had a huge crush but that's about it. Not saying he couldn't but you don't know for sure.

Also the behavior Snape is displaying in the scene im talking about here isn't justified by his abuse. There are at least 3 other people with shitty pasts in this story who don't do things like that. Just because it explains his thought process doesn't mean it excuses him.
