Voldemort, Dumbledore siblings, Regulus, Remus ( turning into a werewolf like real young has to be miserable also the like you can't have a non super violent werewolf attack and he was like what 6?), Sirius as you said

Like Voldemort did many unjustifiable things but...not creeping after some girl who didn't like him back .

Snape's actions after her death with the tearing the picture

Him telling her he wouldn't allow her to like James /see him as a good person.

Him going to Dumbledore to save her but not caring about her family

Him being sorry for calling her a mudblood cuz it a bad word but not sorry for being supportive of a group/movement/people that wanna slaughter muggleborns.

It just repeatedly is a demonstration of him not giving a shit for her beyond his feelings towards her. What matters is his feelings not her. His interest, his pain, his desires, not hers.

Him liking her matters she doesn't matter. Not to Snape. If it did the death eaters being a threat to muggleborns would matter. Trying to keep the family she cared about safe would matter. Her being happy with people who weren't him and seeing that would matter and be tolerated. But it didn't because in his eyes she didn't matter. His feelings did.

Maybe James was the same you don't really know you didn't get to see enough of him. But there is more room for doubt for James. Snape? these moments you get exist to demonstrate that he loved her. And you just repeatedly see him prioritizing his feelings not her.
