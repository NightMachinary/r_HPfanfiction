Personally, I think Snape was obsessed with Lily and not in love with her but because he had not truly loved anyone before meeting her ( other than his mom) so he didnt know what love feels like and assumed he was a in love with her. And to be fair, he was kind of stalker-ish but the guilt probably affected him on some level.
