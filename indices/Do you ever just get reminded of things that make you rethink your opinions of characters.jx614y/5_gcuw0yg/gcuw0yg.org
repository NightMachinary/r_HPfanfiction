Not my opinion change but I wrote An AU Crossover Sherlock Harry Potter story, Where Vernon Dursley passes away when Harry is like three and petunia remarried. I've got one comment that my story actually somehow made a few of my readers like petunia as a character, Which was just kind of funny to me because I've done my best to keep that character kind of true to the books while still kind of a little bit a you. So I liked that comment so I figured I'd share that, Also On occasion I get reminded of like random things Severus Snape did in like the seventh book in the first and second that kind of changed my opinion of him over time as the series progressed as a character
