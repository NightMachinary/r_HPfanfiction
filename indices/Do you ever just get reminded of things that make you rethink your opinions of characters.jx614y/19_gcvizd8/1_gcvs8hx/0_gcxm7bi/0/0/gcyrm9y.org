It could very well have been so. I remember way back in middle school when there was a black girl in class and the others would collectively make fun of her braids and call them worms, alongside more harmful stuff such as commenting on her skin colour being the colour of soot and street tar. This was the least of what they said but likening hair to worms was almost always accompanied by bashing her for her skin colour. Contrast that to when the other girls (I don't live in white countries so the general populace isn't white) did braids and everybody fawned over them.

That was some of the more messed up stuff happening in my class. I used to live in a country where princesses from tribes and whatnot still exist so many, many people were paranoid over offending the royalty girl in class, who was a full blown racist.
