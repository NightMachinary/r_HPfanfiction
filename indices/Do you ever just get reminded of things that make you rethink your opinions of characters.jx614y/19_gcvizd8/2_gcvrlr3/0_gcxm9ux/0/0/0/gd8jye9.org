I travel a lot, so I see a lot. I mean if you feel that's racist, then that's a totally valid viewpoint, I just don't see it the same way, especially when you can change your hair however you like. In my mind(personal opinion btw) it would be racist if the comment was associated with race. There's nothing there to even indicate that Pansy even associates that hairstyle with race rather than personal preference. I'm not trying to be combative or excuse her here, or even an apologist, I just don't really see that connection with race in this argument
