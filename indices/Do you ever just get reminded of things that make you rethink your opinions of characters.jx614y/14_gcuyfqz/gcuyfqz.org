Some people think that because in the last movie Snape confess the truth that he's good. Now people can have their opinion, but I personally think that scene just shows how selfish and obsessive Snape was. Snape never has any affection towards harry. He only care about himself, not Lily like he says, if he cared about Lily he wouldn't give voldy the prophecy, if voldy brought Snape the brain dead body of Lily, he probably would be fine. Snape till his last breath was filled with anger, anger for James and his bullying, anger that he let Lily go, anger that Lily loved his enemy, James, and anger towards himself that he's the reason Lily died. Harry was just the eye of his love in the face of his nemesis, constantly taunting him on his biggest loss.
