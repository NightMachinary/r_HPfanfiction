Yeah. It's sort of heartbreaking, isn't it? Sirius is my favourite character (alongside Ron) just because he's got such an interesting story (horrible home life, stood up for muggle-borns against his family, tried to kill another boy, fought a war, was thrown in prison for thirteen years, trapped in his family home for another year, died), and I think when people talk about his behaviour and restlessness in OotP, they often forget that he was basically reliving the deaths of his best friends in prison for thirteen years.
