Yeah, faking an injury to get Buckbeak killed sealed the deal for me. Dravo, until he faces true evil, was on the way to become evil. Not untik after he lived through what it meant to be a victim (HBP) did he begin a journey towards redemption. And Ä±n the end, after Voldemort was dead, he still hadn't earned it. He should have gone to prison.
