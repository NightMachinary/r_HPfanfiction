Same here. I used to love bashing stories, and robst's stories in particular. I was the typical toxic HP fan who thought Hermione could do no wrong, Ron deserves death, and Harry deserves all the power, and love he wants.

That's now changed to Hermione has her moments, but is overall an average, if intelligent character. Ron is a child, and is allowed some leeway, but reminds me a little too much of Peter Pettergrew. Leeway is fine, abandoning your friends while trying to save the bloody world is straight betrayal. Some argue that the Horcrux lead to that, but it seems Hermione was doing well enough(I never include Harry in will power comparisons. If he can take a mind control on the level of an unforgivable from a wizard who's considered the most powerful dark lord ever(at least of the last 100, or so years), and win, yeah, he's an outlier.)

Harry still deserves all the power, and love he wants. The kid had it rough, and shit didn't get easier for him as a Wizard. All that pressure, near death (and even an actual death) situations, Rita, and the press in general. After 17 years of the crap. Give him everything he wants in stories. I'd love just a nice slice of life post-Hogwarts story. It's why I like godlike Harry stories so much, remembering the crap he went through, kid deserves it.
