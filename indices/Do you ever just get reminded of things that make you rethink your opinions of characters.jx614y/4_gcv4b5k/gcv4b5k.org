Just remembering "these are children" for most fannon characterizations. Yeah, Ron sometimes acts petulant and childish but he's a teenager going through puberty, that shit's rough. Same with Harry being broody. And Draco is a spoiled brat but thats forgivable in a child. Not so much in an adult - lots of the adults in HP are legitimately terrible people. Fudge. Snape. Bagman. Crouch. Etc.
