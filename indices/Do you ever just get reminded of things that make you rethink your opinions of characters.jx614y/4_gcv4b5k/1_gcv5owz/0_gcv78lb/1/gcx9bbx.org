Hey, hey, hey! Let's not forget Pettegrew. Pettergrew, and Umbridge share 1st place as my most hated HP characters. Voldemort in Second, Fudge, and Dumbledore in third. Before anyone starts, I don't believe even the saviour of the world should be treated the way he was as a child just so he was moldable enough to be suicidal. Dumbledore had a hand in that, and from his wording, knew what he was doing. I don't give a rats ass to all you Dumbledore supporters, but putting a child through that has zero justification in my book. Especially when prophecy is involved.

Prophecy in stories is one of three things for me. Unavoidable, it will happen no matter what.

It's avoidable, meaning you can go against it, and change it.

Lastly, the meaning is not clear. Using HP as an example, the wording could mean that the prophecy already happened at Godric's Hollow. Voldemort marked him as his equal, and in doing so "died," or at least didn't survive technically speaking. He could not eat, breathe, or drink. He was dead. It could also mean that live meant enjoying life in general. Until the Battle Of Hogwarts, they were both only surviving, but not living.

No matter which version of prophecy is the correct in HP, a child does not deserve to go through that at the whims of an old man believing he know best. Yes everything worked out in the end, but there is no justification in my mind that says what Dumbledore did was right.
