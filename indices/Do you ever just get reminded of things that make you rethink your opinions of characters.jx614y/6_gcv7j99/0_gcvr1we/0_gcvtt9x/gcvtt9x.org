Currently, I think that Dumbeldore was an army general, that have to win a war, and winning that war was the most important thing, because otherwise it's the end of thousands of lives.

So he had to do everything to end that war.

Including things that he hates himself for doing, things that keep him up at night. Things that made him lose his breakfast, lunch and diner when he thinks too much about it.

This does not work with the manipulative or morall questionable Dumbeldore that comes from fanfictions. But it works with the shady things he did.
