I think that there were actions of Dumbledore that were definitely shady, but a lot of things that people attribute to him I think are because the books portray him as all knowing and all powerful, which I think is primarily due to our lense being Harry. I think a lot of things can be explained by him being just an old man with far too many jobs, and not enough time. Very human failings. I read a lot of manipulative Dumbledore fics, and I think there's a case for the Chessmaster version of him. But I find a Dumbledore that legitimately tries to do the right thing, and legitimately tries to save everyone he can to be a lot more believable. I think some choices he has no real good options, and others he may not have enough information, or maybe he just made a mistake and is trying to find the positive in it, or use it to his advantage. A lot of manipulative or morally questionable Dumbledor stuff comes more from fanfiction than anything else I think
