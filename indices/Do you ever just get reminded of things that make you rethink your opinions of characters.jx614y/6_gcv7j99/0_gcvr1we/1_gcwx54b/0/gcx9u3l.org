He could have done more though. Even just having an actual OOTP to keep an eye on him, and make sure he's being treated right would have made a world of difference. Not Figg, who is either ignorant of what's happening, or worse is that she knows, and doesn't tell Dumbledore, or the worst, she does, and Dumbledore let's it happen.

Dumbledore knows Harry would have to go to school, and leave the house regularly. Having an order member protecting the chosen one outside the houses protections makes more sense. So overall what Dumbledore did has zero justification in my mind. I can understanding sacrificing some men, but not bloody children. Mcgonnagal's words in PS means that Dumbledore at least had an idea of what may happen. So we can't even really use ignorance as an excuse.
