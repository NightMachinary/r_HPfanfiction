  Even if he went to his aunt and uncle who have a son his age someone would have had to check that they could and did adequately care for him (which doesn't seem to have happened given Harrys childhood 'bedroom').

I think it's important to remember that, for all their similarities, "Magical Britain" is different from "Muggle UK" and follow different rules. According from what we saw in Canon, the Ministry of Magic, when it is not in the middle of a war, or run by a paranoid Minister, seems to follow a pretty "hand-off" approach with anything not putting the Statute of Secrecy at risk. We don't know what kind of protocoles they follow when putting a child in Foster care, and I'm not even sure they have any (they seem to just let a family member take care of a child without needing any kind of previous approval, like Neville).

Concerning Harry situation, I think it is also important to consider the following points:

- The Ministry always knew where Harry lived, and approved the situation (as said by Fudge when he met Harry at the start of PoA).
- While Harry knew that Harry would have a "difficult" childhood, and explained at the end of OotP that Harry confort was the least of his concern. His objective was to have Harry "safe" until he is old enough to go to Hogwarts. We can argue all we want about his choices, but at least Harry reached the school alive, and pretty well adjusted (which was far from ensured with other options). Harry could have grow up to be extremely arrogant (like his brother in most WBWL stories), paranoid (Moody Jr) and just suffer in "accident" during his childhood.
- While the Dursleys treatment of Harry was "morally" wrong, it was "legally" pretty acceptable. Judging how child service usually work, and the standards of the 1980's, I think only the "sleep in the cupboard while there are bedrooms available" would pose problem. And even there, I doubt it would be enough to "move" Harry from the House (they usually try to not move the child unless his "safety" is truly at risk) for several reasons). It's not like Harry was daily beaten up (at least by the adults), or treated as a slave (his "chores" seen in Canon are either an exceptionnal occurence of a punishment). If anything, the Dursley seemed quite happy to ignore Harry (unless he made something "freaky", where he was punished). *

Dumbledore made a lot of discutable decisions (though I'm convinced his heart was always in the right place), but I think this one was one of the most easily justifiable ones.
