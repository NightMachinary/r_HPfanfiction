But Harry is an orphan and there is always some sort of protocol involved in placing a child with people who are not their parents. Even if he went to his aunt and uncle who have a son his age someone would have had to check that they could and did adequately care for him (which doesn't seem to have happened given Harrys childhood 'bedroom').

You're right it's not Dumbledore who has any kind of legal responsibility here, but there should have been someone; except of course that Harry was literally left on their doorstep with no muggle or magical authority involved...
