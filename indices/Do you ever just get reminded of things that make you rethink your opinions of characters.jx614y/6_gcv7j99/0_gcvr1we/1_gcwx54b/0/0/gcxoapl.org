The words you are referring to are actually from the movies. I assume you mean the whole, "They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable" statement.

In the books, she says, "Dumbledore -- you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!" which is a valid argument. They are, after all, Muggles. It also implies that Dudley is spoilt, not that the family is abusive. I can understand her concern about not wanting the hero of the wizarding world to grow up like that.

Also, let us be real. He has no real right to check up on the house. He is the Headmaster of the school, not a legal guardian. He placed the boy with his family, something that is the right choice. He should have, lawfully, washed his hands after that.
