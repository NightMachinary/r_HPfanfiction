I agree, people take that comment about "I knew you were going to suffer a dark and difficult 10 years" too far imo, especially when he followed it up with "I saw you weren't as happy or healthy as I would have liked, but you were alive" I think shows that Dumbledore wanted him to be happy and healthy, but honestly was just content with him being alive. I mean, let's be real, the Longbottoms were attacked shortly after by Death Eaters looking for their master. If Harry was placed with a wizarding family you know that would have been publicized all over the place, making him a lot easier to find. Additionally, while the actual transfer was handled a bit shadily (that's not how orphan placement really works) blood relations have priority in terms of claim(in reality there should have suitability checks done to make sure the place was appropriate and all that) but in the end they were his family, he was safely hidden away from the wizarding world, and while his childhood was abysmal, he was still able to come out of it alive and whole in the end. NOT JUSTIFYING HIS TREATMENT AT ALL, but making the best of a horrible situation isn't evil or manipulative
