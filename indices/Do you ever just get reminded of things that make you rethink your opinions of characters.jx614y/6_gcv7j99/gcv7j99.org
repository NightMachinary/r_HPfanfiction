Dumbledore is really the game for me.

He is good, and he is fighting against Voldemort and Dark Magic.

But there's a lot of his decisions that I find cruel and despitable. A lot of things he did, or didn't do that I believe are pretty bad.

But at the same time, I have the feeling that he didn't have a choice.

A reminder of Harry seeing him more tired or appearing his age, will remind me that yeah, maybe the guy was haunted by what he had to do.

And the twinkles eyes after the first book make me thought that he put Harry through unnecessary testings, and not everything he did was against what he wanted.

Dumbledore is complicated like that.
