My belief of Dumbledore since I first read the books has been that he's an old man with too many memories, too much knowledge, and too many responsibilities. Think of all of the titles he holds! That's got to give him some kind of job outside of being headmaster, right? He is placed into the position of dead eating Voldemort (and I can't really remember if we were even ever given a reason as to why it was him and not some kind of legal team? Just because he was a strong wizard I guess?) and that means that of all people he has the most knowledge on the big murder man.

Dumbledore knowing Harry is the prophesy child is a whole deal, though, and can be pulled so many ways.

‘He should have told Harry!' As an 11 year old would you be emotionally mature enough to hear you'd have to fight the MURDERER OF YOUR DEAD PARENTS to the death - not being able to be 10000% sure as to who would win - and that that is your soul destiny? And that that man would continue to live until you do? I don't think any child would! And even if you the try to argue ‘well he could wait until Harry was older'... that's exactly what Dumbledore did. Dumbledore waited until the last possible moment he could tell Harry, but is that better? What time do you tell a child that their destiny is to murder a man or be murdered by him?

‘Harry proved he was strong in the first year, so Dumbledore can't be blamed for relying on him!' Isn't that suspicious as it is? An 11 year old boy (with two other 11 year olds) managed to get through what is basically an obstacle course based off of their personal knowledge and ‘luck'. What does that say about those defences? They were meant to protect the object that could RESURRECT THE DARK LORD and a group of children got through them. I mean, first year level knowledge was enough to make their way through in enough time to get to the end before Quirrell even unwrapped his turban so Voldemort could see. That's either Dumbledore being obnoxiously naïve or some kind of manipulative. Who's to say they weren't all things that Harry & co. had just learnt that year or could figure out easily on purpose? Like some kind of warped training where your prize is murder and a house cup? Who's to say it wasn't a total misunderstanding and Dumbledore was thinking about a wraith, not a corporeal person, and thus couldn't properly prepare? The brooms. Multiple brooms were left in the key room. Preparing for multiple people meant Dumbledore was EXPECTING there to be more than just one person going through the course. Couple this with the fact the potions only had enough for one to turn back and one to go forward? It's almost as though he knew Harry was investigating and didn't stop him...

OH WAIT

HE DID

Hagrid knew that the kids knew about the Cerberus. He knew the kids knew what was in the chamber. He knew that the kids knew why it was there. Most importantly, he knew they wanted to do something about it. You think he wouldn't have told Dumbledore that? That's crucial information!

Besides, getting through a crash course at age 11 is NOT reason to then trust that child to recover dark magical artefacts and destroy them for you. I get that Dumbledore died, but he easily could have passed that information onto a trusted adult and not Harry. It's wrong that he used that point as a pivot.

Except he didn't do that, really. He took five years of Harry getting into shit and getting himself out of it into thought. Now, that doesn't excuse reckless child endanger whatsoever, but it does help us to see that as an old man with little time and even fewer options Harry may seem as a good opportunity. Besides... it's his destiny to defeat Voldemort, right? Couldn't that mean he had to deal with the horcruxes too?

I don't know I have so many opinions on this and could talk about it all day. Sorry for the HELLA LONG rant haha
