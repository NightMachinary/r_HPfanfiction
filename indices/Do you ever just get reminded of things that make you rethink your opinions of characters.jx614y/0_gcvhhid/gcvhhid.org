Re-reading Chamber of Secrets and the fact that Lucius Malfoy tried to get so many Muggleborn children killed, as well as Arthur Weasley's 11 year old daughter, hits differently as an adult. Don't get me wrong, I find the Malfoys to be interesting characters, but they're SO far from good it's a little mind-boggling.

And then he just... gets off scot free? Harry testifies on his behalf after the war because Narcissa saved his life? The man thought it entirely acceptable to murder children to dispose of and as retaliation for his home being searched for Dark Artifacts.
