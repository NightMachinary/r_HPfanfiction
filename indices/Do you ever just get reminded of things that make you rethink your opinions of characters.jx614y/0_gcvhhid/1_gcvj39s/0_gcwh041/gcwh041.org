Hm maybe I'm remembering that Lucius testified against other Death Eaters to earn his freedom (which is on Pottermore), but I swear I remembering something about Harry speaking up for the family... All in interviews post-publication of course, so not canon at all in the strictest sense.

Also Harry's kind of a softie, I feel like him seeing Lucius tortured from Voldemort's POV in the last book would drive him to pity.
