I mean Lucius knew it was a dark artifact that Voldemort gave to him, but did he know what it would do specifically, or was he just taking advantage of the situation. I always thought he was clueless on what it did, but hoped to get Arthur in trouble some way due to Arthur's hand in the raiding of dark artifacts. I'm not even sure if he knew that what was happening at school was his own doing, or just him taking advantage of said situation. I mean he was taking advantage whether he knew, or not, but I always felt that maybe he knew he caused the problem, but only after he'd already given the diary away.
