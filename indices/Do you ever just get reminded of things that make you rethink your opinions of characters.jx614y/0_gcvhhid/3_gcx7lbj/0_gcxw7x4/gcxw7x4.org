Given his attitude of using the situation to get Dumbledore sacked but not even attempting to pull Draco out of school suggests he had a pretty good idea of what was going on. I think if some unknown entity was ravaging the school, even if claiming to only kill Muggleborn students, he wouldn't have wanted Draco around in case it changed its mind.

However a force that the Dark Lord personally assured him would cleanse the school of all those of non-magical parentage? I think he'd feel a lot more confident in leaving Draco in school for that. Whether he knew it was a Basilisk or not I couldn't say... I'd guess not, because it seems like that's a creature with a lot of room for error/accidental murder.
