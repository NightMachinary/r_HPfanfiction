Less a specific person but re-reading the books.. Hogwarts is such a shitty school... Even if we ignore all the Voldemort stuff

Shitty and/or abusive teachers: - Snape - abusive, hates children ect - Hagrid - incompetent, unqualified - Binns - just no - Trelawney - bad with children, fraud? - Lupin - confronting 13 year olds with the worst fears is not ok. - Lockhart.. just why - Unbridge - abusive, hates children - Moody - traumatizing - Quirrel - incompetent

Teacher to student ratio.. According to JKR there a 1000, but if you do math with the students we know in the book there are 280. According to hp.lexicon there are fourteen teachers at Hogwarts with possibly 4 non academic staff members so 18 adults total. 18/1000 is a ridiculous ratio so I won't even talk about it 280/18 is a bit better.

There is a document called the boarding school national minimum standards for the UK. Hogwarts breaks most of the requirements.. - no dedicated student support staff: all boarding schools have some sort of house master or matron whos entire job is to take care of students. The heads of houses don't count because they already have full time jobs teaching - disability accomodations.. don't even get me started - going home for only the summer and Christmas holidays is not realistic.. usually there would at least be half terms and Easter break. - of the 18 adults.. many can't be relied upon to support children eg defense professor, filch, trelawney, Hagrid, Snape. - professors are not qualified to teach children. In the UK you don't just need to know about a subject you also need to learn loads about how to teach children.. there is no way Hagrid, Snape, Trelawney, Lockhart, Unbridge are qualified. - headmaster and deputy head are full time jobs. But Dumbledore is chief warlock of the wizengamot, supreme mugwump AND runs a vigilante organization on the size. McGonagall teaches and is also deputy head and head of house. Those are 3 full time jobs.

I haven't even talked about how Hogwarts runs on Slavery and all the crap that happens there to Harry.

TL:DR ofstead would have shut down Hogwarts pretty much as soon as they arrived.
