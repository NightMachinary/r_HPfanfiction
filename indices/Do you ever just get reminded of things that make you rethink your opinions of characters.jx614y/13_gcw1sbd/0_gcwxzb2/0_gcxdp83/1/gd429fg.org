I personally think that facing a boggart is purely voluntarily, advised to do but not a must have. I mean it can really unearth something you really don't want to experience but let's be real, that's the extreme. Most children that age has minor fears and the class teaches them a defense against one of the worst possible monster they can encounter early on.
