Honestly though, I'm kinda in the Dumbledore camp when he says this "It is our actions that define us", yeah Snape had a shitty life, and yeah Lily was the kindness he latched onto, but he chose to do the things he did, fully and willingly. That picture being a small token to hold onto I read as more of a moment of spite, if he can't have her then he doesn't want her family to have her. As for the spy thing...Voldemort was using Snape as a spy same as Dumbledore, so having to play the part of the vicious evil bastard doesn't really make sense...if I send a spy into enemy territory, I don't want them acting like they never reformed as a death eater...I want them to act like they are on the side they're spying on. It never made sense to me when people said that his abuse was playing a part to trick Voldemort when, if I was Voldemort, I'd be incredibly pissed that my spy was apparently blowing their cover. Not only that but Dumbledore was pretty much the only person who trusted Snape, and while that would get him a lot of information, imagine how much more information would be available to him if other people saw him as someone to confide in. In the end, yeah Snape was on the right side of the conflict, but even in his last moments he was an obsessive stalker, I mean his last words were to tell Harry to look at him and then make a comment about her eyes. Even in his last moments all he cared about was Lily, which can be romantic, but in the context of all his other actions is just kinda creepy
