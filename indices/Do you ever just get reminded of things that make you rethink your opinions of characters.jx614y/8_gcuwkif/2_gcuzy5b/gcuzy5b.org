It is a bit interpretation but looking through his memories kinda made it seem more he cared more about what she represented to him not who she was.

There's that ripped picture sure

But there's also him more fixated on her not liking James and not listening to her about the disturbing actions of her friends.

How he doesn't see a problem joining a group that wants to wipe out muggleborns despite the fact she is one.

His focus is always is always his connection to her not her.

Yes you could argue its him not understanding love and that could be true. But it makes him less the character I thought he was and makes me pity her more than him.
