This!! I felt sad for Snape - maybe not quite as sympathetic as you though - while simultaneously feeling disturbed by his stalker tendencies.

The guy really rolled a 0 on life happiness. By signing up to do Dumbledore's bidding, he really gave away all autonomy and never got to pursue anything for himself, or anyone. Shit, he didn't even get to see Voldemort die and know it was all worth it.

Nor did Dumbledore explain to Snape that, after being killed, Harry would/might return back to life because of the horcrux. I wish Dumbledore had told Snape that, because it seemed that Snape thought Harry would die *and* Voldemort, not that Harry would die but then return.
