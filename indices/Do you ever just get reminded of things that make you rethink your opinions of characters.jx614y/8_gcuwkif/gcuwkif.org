Notice: major speculation and interpretation/extrapolation/opinion ahead.

I adore Snape the character but not necessarily the person. That move to rip and steal the picture did feel wrong. However, I looked at the circumstances of the time. He was deep undercover as a spy, had to watch his every thought around Voldemort, and was hired into a position (Headmaster) where he had no allies and would be universally despised. He had to act the part.

The picture gave him a small token to hold on to when everything was crumbling around him. It reminded him of who he was fighting for and why. Yeah, it sucked that he ripped the picture and took it from Sirius and Harry. Yeah, it was creepy. But under the circumstances, I can get it.

I do think that Snape was rather obsessed/infatuated with Lily. She was one of the few people who were genuinely kind to him. I think he could have outgrown it if given the chance to move on with his life, but his oath to Dumbledore kept him chained to Lily's memory and his mistakes.

I had hoped that the book 7 â€˜love interest' for Snape would lead to major character growth. The interest in Lily was a fascinating plot twist, but I was let down that Snape didn't get to experience real love and grow from it. He died without knowing true love.
