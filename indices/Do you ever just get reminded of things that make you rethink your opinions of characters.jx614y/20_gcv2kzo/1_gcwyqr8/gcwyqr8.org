Am I the only one who never disliked any of the Weasleys?:D I mean the twins can be seen as class clowns or bullies but considering the slyhterin behaviour and that they also get picked on I'm pretty sure for their family social status I wouldn't count out relatiation from them. Percy was an overachiever and wanted to get out of the social digma his family suffered and thought a good career would help with that. Bill and Charlie are awesomely portrayed. Molly was a mother-hen for sure but consider that she has a big family that wants to fight and she lost her brothers the same day that leaves a big wound in your soul. Ginny was a bit stalkerish but when she grew out of it she was great. Ron is one of my favorite because he was a flawed human being. Mr Weasley was a funny guy with a weird outlook on muggles but a good person.
