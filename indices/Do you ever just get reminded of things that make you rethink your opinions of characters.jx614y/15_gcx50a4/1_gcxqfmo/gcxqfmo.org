I agree completely.

The passage in question by the way

/The prophecy did not refer to a woman," said Dumbledore. "It spoke of a boy born at the end of July--"/

/"You know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt her down-- kill them all--"/

/"If she means so much to you," said Dumbledore, "surely Lord Voldemort will spare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son?"/

/"I have-- I have asked him--"/

/"You disgust me," said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little, "You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you have what you want?"/

/Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore./

/"Hide them all, then," he croaked. "Keep her-- them-- safe. Please."/

So ya he really doesn't care as long as Lilly lives. He doesn't deny anything Dumbledore says. It just seems to be the easier way for Dumbledore to hide Lilly if Dumbledore hid the family. But he didn't care about the family and how much she cared for them. If he did he'd realize than no Voldemort was going to target the kid no matter what and go to Dumbledore right then. Instead he goes to Voldemort to spare the mother and didn't even bother trying to save the family she cared about.

So I'm convinced he only cared that he had feelings for her. He didn't care about her beyond that.
