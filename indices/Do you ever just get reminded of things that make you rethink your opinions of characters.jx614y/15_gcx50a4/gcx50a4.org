It's been so long since I've read the book that I couldn't tell you, but I just wanted to react to what you said about Snape.

I found the whole Snape loved Lily to be really creepy, not because the guy loved his best friend (I've been in this situation when I was a teenager) but because of his attitude overall.

When he discovered that the prophecy might have referred to Lily, he asked Voldemort to spare her and Dumbledore to save only her (at least at first). He couldn't ask Voldemort to spare James and Harry, but he could have asked Dumbledore to protect them all. He didn't care if her husband and son died, and what it would do to her. The only reason he eventually caved and asked for James and Harry's protection is because Dumbledore mentioned them (if I remember correctly).

And then even though he swore to protect Harry, the guy decided to bully the eleven YO son of the woman he loved just because he looked like James the second he stepped in to the castle. I mean, I can understand why it would be painful to look at Harry, but how petty do you have to be to treat a defenceless kid like that? Even more so when you are indirectly responsible for the kid's parents death and you owed his father a life debt (which are a real thing since Wormtail died by betraying one [at least in the movie]).

Tbh, Snape seemed more obsessed with Lily than in love with her. And it's even more pathetic when you know that Lily stopped being friend with him at least 5 years before her death. So it's not as if he couldn't have moved on long before her death.
