I won't defend the Twins' atrocious behaviour but I take exception to the current trend that says the whole problem with the Acid Pop was all that bad. If they were really so dangerous and cruel, they wouldn't be sold for general consumption in a sweet shop. It's also implied that wizards have hardier constitutions and a greater proclivity for danger.

Not excusing The Twins, but I honestly think that compared to everything else they've done, The Acid Pop episode gets blown so far out of proportion.
