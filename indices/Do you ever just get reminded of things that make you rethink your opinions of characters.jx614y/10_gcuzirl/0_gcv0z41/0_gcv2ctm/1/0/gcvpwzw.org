Anyone who tells you kids are angels never had any, or really need to take off the rose tinted glasses. Kids are boundary pushers. They have no idea what boundaries are where and will push the ever loving crap out of them to see what the limits are. Their brains are also severely underdeveloped at that age, and really have trouble with the concept of "other" and are pretty much only fully aware of the "self"
