ok maybe it just me but I think most kids like 9 and below do some really fucked up shit. Like 4 year olds with magic would be actual monsters. So if they did when they very young im more willing to forgive.

I do remember the testing product thing now and that was kinda fucked up I will admit.

Don't remember the Slytherin first year stuff but also mean .
