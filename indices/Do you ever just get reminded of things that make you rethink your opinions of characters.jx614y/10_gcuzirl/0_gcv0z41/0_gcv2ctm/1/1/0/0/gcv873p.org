They put Montague in a the vanishing cabinet over Montague trying to dock them points.

Montague spent weeksl lost between Hogwarts and Borgin & Burke, and came out really really badly affected. He spent month in the hospital wards, clearly deeply traumatized.

And the twins didn't show any remorse, not even after they've seen the affect it had on Montague.

Like, sure Montague was being a dick, but it doesn't excuse what they did.
