1) He was a member of the Inquisitorial Squad, so he probably deserved it.

2) He was only in there for a day (if the wiki is accurate, at least).

3) His injuries seem much more likely to have come from his own attempts at unlicensed apparation out of a vanishing cabinet into Hogwarts, which sounds like an incredibly stupid idea for several reasons.

4) There's nothing that indicates that they thought he was trapped between cabinets and not just lost wherever the other cabinet happened to be.

5) His only mention before OotP was in a Quidditch game in PoA, when he grabbed Katie's head. Considering the speeds and heights involved, that seems like a much more credible attempt at murder or at least serious injury than anything the twins did to him. And considering the Slytherin team's reputation, that sort of thing was probably very common.
