For years I thought Albus caught Snape listening to the prophesy and let him go intentionally so the prophesy would be self fulfilling. Later I found out it was Abeforth that caught him and tossed him out. I had always thought that was a defining moment where Dumbledore became a manipulative bastard willing to sacrifice innocents. Dumbledore is frequently written in fanon as Greater Good obsessed, but he hates that phrase.
