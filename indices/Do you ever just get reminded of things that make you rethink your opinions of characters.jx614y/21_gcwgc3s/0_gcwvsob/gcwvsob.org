Yes! I think Harry learned to appreciate Hermione but I hate it when in fics people make them BFFs without Ron because that isn't their dynamic. There's a reason they're a trio, and the point of all of their fights is to show that without one of them it wouldn't work. Ron is the emotional heart of the trio- the argument that Harry holds Ron and Hermione together isn't true, because a) Ron and Hermione spend a /ton/ of time together without Harry, and b) Without Ron, who actually is the glue, Harry and Hermione can be awkward. This isn't to say that they don't love each other, they do, their love is like sibling love, and it's great, but without Ron, Harry can be very mean to Hermione.
