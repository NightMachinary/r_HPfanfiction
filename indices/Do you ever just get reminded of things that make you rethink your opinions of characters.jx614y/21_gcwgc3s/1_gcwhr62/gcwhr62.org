I mean in fairness it pretty accurate to generally how teens behave i don't think Harry is uniquely a dick but your average teenager is dickish.

That being said the reason I think people ship them more in fic is because they remember the movies more.

The movies don't have Harry's inner monologue. And less than nice thing he has to say about Hermione he generally doesn't keeps it to himself so in the movies you hear nothing and so it seems their relationship is less chaotic. Ron and Hermione actually seem to get along better Ron is like the glue he gets along great with Harry too. Harry and Hermione like each other but they not used to hanging out with Ron. But Ron has the most dramatic fights with both friends. And its I think that dramatic because they usually get along decently enough so its very disruptive. Especially the Harry Ron one which feels even more intense because Harry your pov character.
