With regards to that, as awful as Snape was, he didn't want Harry to die, yet he had to be the one to give the boy the news. Also he was about to enter in a place where most people hated him despite having been his colleagues (and maybe friends?) for years. So I think it's fair he had with him a reminder of why he was doing all that.

As for my opinion regarding characters... I know I brought this up quite a lot recently but I had just re-read the series and I remembered how nasty Harry was towards Hermione, even if he didn't always show it. In GoF, when he fights with Ron, he actually thinks that he much more prefers Ron's company than hers. In OotP she is always the target of his outbursts. In HBP he is extremely annoyed with her nagging and is really grateful when Ginny calls her out. In DH he is annoyed with her for being a shitty cook, for crying over Ron, for destroying his wand (even though it was an accident while she was trying to save him), for not talking to Ron and for not believing in the Hallows. While I had forgotten this, now I can no longer help myself but wonder how can most fanfic writers make her best friends with Harry without Ron there. He might have been bickering with her a lot but he always stood up for her, while Harry always chose Ron over her and other than some significant points, he was pretty shitty to her.
