I personally liked Harry a lot in both OotP and DH not because he treats his friends badly but because in my opinion for the first time in the series Harry behaves in a "normal" way

I mean Harry has been someone who has had a shitty childhood where he has been neglected and mistreated all his life by his tutors And when it seems that things are going to improve since he can go to a school where he can stay most of the year without having to go home turns out that there is a crazy psychopath who wants to kill him and tries several times throughout his school life in addition to discovering the truth about what happened to his parents who, in addition to being killed by the crazy psychopath who now wants to killing him were also betrayed by 1 of their best friends who blamed another of their friends who was supposed to have been Harry's real tutor

And yet despite all this accumulation of events and chaotic emotions in Harry's mind he turned out to be someone very adapted with few consequences from his childhood for example 1 could attribute Harry's lack of confidence in adults and sometimes in himself and in his own abilities as a result of the dursleys' mistreatment of him

but in general Harry is someone that the first books seemed too unreal to me that he was so emotionally and mentally stable that is why I like the change that we started to see in OotP where he finally broke down emotionally and lets out all the frustration, anger and sadness that It has been accumulating in him for a long time, Harry in this book begins to behave like someone with post-traumatic stress which makes all the sense in the world because he has literally just gone through a horrible trauma just last summer he has seen his schoolmate die that although he was not his friend, he was a person who liked him so that later the government refuses to listen to his statements and on top of that they use the press to manipulate public opinion against him and make him look like a liar and a madman to top it off, he has to go home that he hates so much but this time also with the paranoia of not knowing what Voldemort is doing and even fears that they will attack him (remember how quickly he reacted when I hear the magician who was looking after him disappear) he maintains correspondence with his friends who reveal absolutely nothing to him and keep him in ignorance like everyone else and to put the cherry on the cake a couple of dementors attack him and almost make him They kiss him and his cousin and when he uses magic in self-defense the useless Government tries to expel him from the school by subjecting him to a trial and they try to remove the only tool that provides him with some security (his wand) So it does not surprise me that Harry for the first time once in his life he breaks up and behaves in a mean way with the most even if they are his friends

And what happens in DH is the same, I understand Hermione is sad because ron left but I agree with Harry that this was not the best time to collapse, especially because there is a group of crazy people who are trying to hunt them down and what if they got to catch it, they would most likely die
