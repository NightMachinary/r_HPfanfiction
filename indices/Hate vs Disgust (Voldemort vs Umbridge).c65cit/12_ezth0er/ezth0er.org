The difference is, Umbridge is personal. Voldemort tortures and kills. Huh. Cool. Don't particularly hate him. But /Umbridge/ picks on weaknesses. When the last thing Harry need was to be called a liar, that is exactly what she did. And, unlike Voldemort, they couldn't do anything because she worked in the ministry and no one cared. That's why we hate her.
