We get a lot more in canon of Tom Riddle's journey towards villainy. He's apparently always been a power-hungry psychopath, but a handsome one. A charismatic one. One who gained young Ginny's confidence, and whom even Dumbledore said had a sympathetic start. He's a better-fleshed-out character. The appeal of romantically pairing him with another character is similar to the appeal of Anne Rice's vampires, or the horrible people in /Dangerous Liaisons/. Evil, but glamorous.

Umbridge in canon is a one-note character. She's ugly, inside and out. She looks like “someone's maiden aunt,” and she talks with that stupid saccharine girly voice. She has no charisma, and no appeal. No one wants to see what's under that ugly pink cardigan because no one has seen anything appealing about her.
