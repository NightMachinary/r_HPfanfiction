The problem we have is that Harry Potter books are from the point of view of very unreliable narrator: teenage hormonal boy under unbelievable amount of stress (the same applies to Dursleys, BTW, we really don't know much about them). We don't know much about who Dolores Umbridge truly is, we see only how Harry sees it. Yes, she is obviously very cruel and awful person, but we really don't know much about her. I am not defending her actions, but even the path towards evil is usually more complicated. In this regard, the portrait of Dolores Umbridge in linkffn(Error of Soul by Materia-Blade) is one which deserves an attention. It is a very unique story even in other ways, highly recommended (and yes, it is unfinished and rather cruelly in the middle of the story arc and cliffy).
