Umbridge is simply much more relatable evil. Few have experience with psycopaths who want to take over the world, but many people met their own Umbridges.

That said, I don't like when Umbridge is senselessly bashed, presented as stupid and incapable of anything, just a target for the heroes to humiliate. It's just against everything that makes her such a compelling villain and it makes defeating her so much cheaper. Like, Umbridge is a sadistic bitch, but she is smart. It's not that she doesn't believe Harry about Voldemort, she at least seriously entertained the possibility since she sent Dementors to silence Harry. But she is at Hogwarts to enforce the party line, so even meeting Voldemort face to face wouldn't change her rhetoric. Probably the opposite, actually. And I doubt she really believes that the theory is a way to teach Defence or failed her own DADA OWL, like many fics claim. She herself was able to produce a corporeal Patronus with a piece of Voldemort's soul over her neck in a room full of Dementors. No, she doesn't teach anything because the Ministry don't want Dumbledore's loyalists to be able to fight. Making her see how wrong she is about everything won't work because she's already aware of that. She's also a higher-up that has the full backing of the Minister and isn't afraid to use it against anyone, sending for the Ministry official /cough \/Amelia Bones* cough* and presenting the facts won't magically resolve everything. That's why she's so terrifying. She knows full well what she's doing, and you cannot do anything about it.
