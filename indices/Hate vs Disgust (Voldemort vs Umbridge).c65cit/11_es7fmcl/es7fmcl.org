Here's my perspective on this.

Umbridge was a personal relatable antagonist who we saw very directly and significantly harass, harm, and otherwise alter the story. She has no redeeming qualities. We all know a situation of unjust punishment being dished out, of being accused of lying when you're honest, and the anger of someone abusing their power. We all know an Umbridge that we already dislike which makes her a symbol of that hatred.

Voldemort was someone we directly encountered... Three times in the entire series. The resurection, the Department of Mysteries, and the scene he died. He had very little direct influence on the plot. He doesn't really do anything bad to the protagonists directly. We are even made to have sympathy and pity for him due to his childhood which further dulls the already weak dislike we already had. How many evil dark lords have you met in your life? He just isn't comparable to someone you have ever hated in your actual life.

Voldemort is one of the weakest characterizations of a villain I've ever read about - he's on a similar standing as Galbatorix from Eragon a series that is mediocre at its highest. He just isn't compelling, he isn't relatable, he has little effect on the plot, and he was no personality. There just isn't anything to hate because there's not really anything there.
