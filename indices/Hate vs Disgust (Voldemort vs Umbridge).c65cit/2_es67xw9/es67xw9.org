I agree on some of your points, especially that of how Umbrige hits closer to home. However I also find that the way that Voldemort and Umbrige are presented make a valuable difference in the audience response.

If you go to how Umbrige is introduced she is described as ugly(toad like(not sure if the book uses that exact description)) and to top it off she also tortures student especially in a more realistic feeling with the blood quill that makes some readers relate too . In contrast Voldemort is first presented as a evil bastard that wanted domination, but then in the second book he is shown as a person who was not only handsome and charming but also was smart, meaning that in the eyes of many he was doing what he thought was the right path for the future.

So this deference of character might make the people see more of that tom riddle than Voldemort appearance, while in Umbrige all the fandom sees is a fat ugly person who only cares about her own interests.

This is only a theory A harry potter theory Thanks for reading
