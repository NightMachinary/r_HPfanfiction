I don't mean that you are only disgusted by things you hate, only that people tend to also be disgusted by things they already hate. The hate vs disgust dichotomy you are presenting is false. We don't just hate Voldemort, we love to hate him. And disgust isn't the only thing we feel for Umbridge, we hate her. Actually, personally, there are only four Harry characters that disgust me (Petunia, Vernon, Medungus, and Bellatrix). On the other hand, the list that Umbridge falls under (characters that make me angry) is much longer; though she is towards the top of that list.
