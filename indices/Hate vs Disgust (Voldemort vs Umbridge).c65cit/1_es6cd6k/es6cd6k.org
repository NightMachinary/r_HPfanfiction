The things umbridge did are easier for people to relate to their own experiences. Voldemort uses a torture curse that no one can really imagine how it feels since we'll never use it. Umbridge meanwhile does a torture based on cuts, which we've all experienced, and it's made worse by how the victim was made to do it to themselves, which again many people can relate to. People relate to how it feels to be called a liar in front of others when they are in fact being truthful. People know how it feels to be punished for something they didn't do. Many people know the fear of seeing a viscous person in a position of power. I honestly think that the reason umbridge is so hated is simply because her actions were so mundane. She wasn't a fantasy evil, she was the very real evil that we all see on a regular basis.
