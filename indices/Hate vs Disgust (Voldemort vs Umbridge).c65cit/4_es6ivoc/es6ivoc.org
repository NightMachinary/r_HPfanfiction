There's a second layer - at the end of the day, Voldemort has the kind of freedom born from power, a thing we generally desire.

​

Also, Voldemort's motives ultimately stem from very relatable things - fear of death and revenge against those who wronged and rejected him.

​

There are thus numerous avenues to sympathizing with him, especially if he never had a chance (on account of the whole love-potion birth-defect thing).

Also, most people don't generally deal with people who are actively trying to them - Voldemort's evil is too abstract.

Umbridge, on the other hand, is the avatar of every faceless bureaucrat that screws us, delights in petty torments, every terrible teacher who reveled in exercising power over mere children... She is the evil we know all too well, that hounds us from day to day - we cannot help but learn to hate her, for we know her all too well...
