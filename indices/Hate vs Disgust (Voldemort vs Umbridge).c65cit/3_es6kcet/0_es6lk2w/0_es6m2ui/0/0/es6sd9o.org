Sure, and that could've been a really compelling story. Like over the course of seven books, we've got the three protagonists of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the three antagonists are Death's Cloak, the Elder Wand, and the Resurrection Stone which come into the possession of and begin corrupting the protagonists.

Harry just wants to be normal, wants a family and friends. He wants to hide from his fame and destiny. He gets the Cloak. It tempts him. Somewhere in the middle of the series, he uses the Cloak to get away with a terrible act. He regrets this, grows, and when he faces his Moral Event Horizon, he casts away the Cloak and takes responsibility for his actions.

Ron wants to be great. He wants to stand out from his brothers, and wants the power and recognition of greatness. He gets the Elder Wand. He becomes unbeatable, a prodigy of the International Duelling Circuit. The trio face down problems that can only be survived through overwhelming magical might and Ron saves the day via the Elder Wand. Eventually, his hammer makes him see all problems as nails, and he gets frustrated by his inability to solve problems through sheer power ("Why can't I get Hermione to love me?!"). He falls into darkness. He is either redeemed at the end (since it's a "kid's book") or he falls completely and becomes the main baddie of the last book or two. It's heart-wrenching for Harry to have to fight him.

Hermione wants to understand everything. She can't stand a mystery. She hates ignorance and the greatest point of ignorance for the entire human race is what lies beyond the veil of death. She gets the Resurrection Stone. She uses it to confer with the greatest minds of the past. She soars to new heights of magical understanding, synthesizing lost, hidden knowledge with modern scientific understanding. Eventually she delves too deep, uncovers knowledge that is a memetic threat - just knowing it is dangerous. But she's convinced that solving the problem just requires even more knowledge. In the end, she is either redeemed (since it's a "kid's book") and comes to accept the ineffible mystery of life - most notably love and her love for Harry/Ron - or she falls completely to darkness and has to be defeated by Harry.

If I were doing this, I'd have the final book be Hermione and Harry vs. Ron, with Hermione and Harry having given up and destroyed their Hallows and having to rely on teamwork (Neville, Luna, et. al.) and cleverness to overcome the hugely OP magical power of Ron.

You don't need a Voldemort to make the Harry Potter world both amazing and coherent and with a looming, dangerous evil. All you really need in an ounce of foresight and planning to make the world-building NOT terrible.

EDIT: This idea won't leave me alone now.

Each book would need to operate on three tracks. The main track would be the interactions among the protagonists and with their Hallows. The secondary track would be the antagonist of each story (Umbridge, Lockhart, etc.), and the final track would be the "B-plot" of various world-building and minor characters that comes to get paid off in the final book.

Book 1:

- Main Track: Harry gets the Cloak. The Trio become friends. The Cloak is all innocent fun for 11 year olds.
- Second Track: Dark Lord Voldemort was defeated? Or was he?! Something like the Philosopher's Stone plot.
- Third Track: We meet Neville, the Twins, Draco, etc. Draco isn't so overwhelmingly obnoxious. He has a tragic backstory and is eventually redeemed a la Zuko from A:TLA.

Book 2:

- Main Track: Harry continues to use the Cloak, but some of his actions start to seem mean-spirited or inappropriate. Hermione gets the Stone. Climactic scene when she finally figures it out and summons her beloved Grandmother.
- Second Track: Something like the CoS plot, with Hermione's knowledge from the past saving the day in the end.
- Third Track: We learn about Basilisks and other magical creatures. We meet some Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs that will come back to help Harry at the end.

Book 3:

- Main Track: Harry continues to use the Cloak. It saves them in a major way, but he also does at least one thing that's unquestionably bad and gets away with it. Hermione begins using the Stone. Near the end of the book she essentially cheats on a test by calling up a dead professor. She rationalizes the shit out of her choice. Ron gets the Wand.
- Second Track: Something like the PoA plot, but no fucking Time Turners. Time-travel's a goddamn can of worms and not worth opening.
- Third Track: We begin to learn about wizarding politics, the evils of complacency, and bit more about the wider world of Wizarding Britain. We meet Bones or someone "good" in the government who will come back to help Harry in the final book.

Book 4:

- Main Track: Harry faces a key choice about the Cloak and decides not to use it. Shoves it in his trunk and tries to ignore it but can feel it calling him. Struggles with what to do. Hermione has a major breakthrough with the Stone and becomes the youngest person ever to be published in Transfiguration Monthly. Begins to struggle with feeling like all her work is cheating. Ron attunes to the Wand and starts kicking ass.
- Second Track: Basically the Goblet of Fire. Harry considers cheating with the Cloak but turns it down, but he does take advantage of some of Hermione's new knowledge to defeat one or more of the tasks. Maybe an expanded tournment including non-champions (quiz bowl, dueling tournament, etc.) where Ron can shine.
- Third Track: We learn about the international community. Meet Fleur and Krum, learn about them as real people, and they end up on Harry's side in the final book.

Book 5:

- Main Track: Harry surrenders the Cloak. He is redeemed. Hermione struggles and we're not sure if she will surrender the Stone. She discovers the memetic threat but can't quite bring herself to accept ignorance. Ron starts getting really aggressive with his magic but when confronted about the dangers of the Hallows, refuses and chooses the Wand over redemption.
- Second Track: Keep Umbridge in all her delicious awfulness. But have Hermione defeat her via whatever the memetic knowledge-threat is. This is the cat-fight novel where the focus is primarily on Hermione and Umbridge (and maybe McGonagall, Fleur, etc.) Hermione watches in horror as Umbridge's head melts with knowledge "that man was not meant to meddle" with.
- Third Track: Sirius is exonerated and we learn more about dark magic, secret family grimoires, etc. Harry and Hermione will use secret knowledge from the Black family vault in the final book. Contrast is drawn between knowledge that is simply hoarded by families vs. intentionally scrubbed from history due its danger.

Book 6:

- Main Track: Hermione surrenders the Stone. She chooses Harry over Ron. Ron stews in anger and book ends with us unsure what Ron will do.
- Second Track: Voldemort. Voldemort is defeated utterly. Fuck Horcruxes, just give Voldemort a single phylactery that has to be tracked down and destroyed.
- Third Track: We finally learn the true nature of Lily's sacrifice for Harry. Dumbledore sacrifices himself to save Ron, but the contrast is how Ron rejects salavation vs. Harry's redemption. We learn about deeper, older magic like blood magic. Harry and Hermione use this at the end. (I'm a sucker for sad endings, so I'd say jesus-Harry sacrifices himself to save Hermione.)

Book 7:

- Main Track: Ron falls completely to darkness, unable to accept Hermione's choice. Harry and Hermione defeat him.
- Second Track: Ron himself is the villain, now. There's no Umbridge or Fudge or Lucius to fight against. Ron makes himself into a Dark Lord and seizes the tattered remnants of the Death Eaters and forges them into the magic-Gestapo that must be defeated.
- Third Track: Harry and Hermione use all the friends they've gathered along the way, all the little tricks that have come up as a way to defeat Ron.
