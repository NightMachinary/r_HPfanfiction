Voldemort is a terrible villain.

Aside from the encounter in the Chamber of Secrets, he's totally unrelatable and unreal. We can't understand him as a person, we can't understand his goals, and his behavior is so insanely pants-on-head stupid that we can't even properly fear him as a powerful dictator type.

Like a lot in canon, he's a walking deus ex machina, a person-shaped hole through which author fiat pours over the plot.

All of this is basically fine for the first book or three. In kids' books, adults are often presented more as forces of nature than comprehensible people. Which is fine, because to an 11 year old kid, basically any adult is so much more powerful (physically, socially, economically, whatever) that going against an adult can be likened to opposing a hurricane. (For a truly exceptional example of this and how opposing-a-hurricane grows into opposing-a-person, read the Knife of Never Letting Go series. [Really. Seriously. I cannot possibly recommend this series highly enough.])

But that all falls apart right around book 4 (and certainly by book 5). Harry's starting to view the world through a more mature lens and so a real antagonist needs to be a real character, with real motivations and disgusting but comprehensible behaviors (sadistic glee from torturing kids with a blood quill). Umbridge fits the bill perfectly. I happen to hate book 5 and have never re-read it, but for all its faults, Umbridge carries the whole thing. If it's worth reading at all, it's because Umbridge is such a perfectly detestable villain.

The problem at that point is that Rowling didn't give us another Umbridge for book six or seven, or grow Voldemort into a saner, more comprehensible villain. Instead we got a bunch of forgettable fucking-about for book 6 and then the infamous camping-trip-from-hell for book 7. Aside from a few really good action set pieces, those last two books are a complete fucking botch of the series precisely because they don't have a single focal point on a fantastic, contemptible villain like Umbridge.
