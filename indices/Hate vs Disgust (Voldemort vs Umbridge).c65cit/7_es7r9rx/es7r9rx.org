While I do think your point is valid I would say its hatered more than disgust that causes people to dislike Umbridge more than Voldemort.

Its just a personal more grounded kind of opression compared to Voldemort. His form of villainy is on a large scale to a degree that many haven't felt personally or directly. Voldemort very rarely is directly fighting or messing with Harry and his friends. Even when hes actively trying to kill him its through other people he's the one pulling the strings. Yes thats hatable and you dislike him for that. But its not the person who is directly causing the discomfort. So more direct and more relatable.
