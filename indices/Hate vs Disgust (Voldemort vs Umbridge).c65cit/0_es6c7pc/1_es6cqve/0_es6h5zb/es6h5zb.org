  Similarly, on a disgust scale, I'm more of a fan of the books than the movies, so even though I love Alan Rickman, I've always pictured Snape as hook-nosed and greasy and kind of gross, so I can't do Snape pairings either. And I think the people that do are visualizing Rickman, and not the book Snape.

I as a person who can and does do Snape pairings, I wish people would stop saying that. Nothing can trigger my Do Not Want button faster than visualizing 60 y.o. pudgy Alan Rickman in a bad wig circa movie 6-8. I love Alan Rickman, but never in this role. But 30-something Snape from the books? His only problem lookswise is bad skin and hair. And as for personality, book!Snape with his temper and sarcasm and glaring insecurities is much more interesting character than always reserved movie!Snape.
