Well, snarry is my all time OTP, but I don't find Snape's personality attractive. Instead, the fact that he is so fucked up and complicated is exactly what makes him such a fascinating character. He's passionate, clever, brave, witty, proud and also an unrepentant jerk who holds to his grudges and bullies children. He had a horrible childood, made some really bad choices and then did his best to atone for them even though his best wasn't always the best. I love him as a character, although I wouldn't enjoy hanging out with him as a person.

As for attractiveness, I don't see Snape as conventionally attractive, but I don't think he's that bad looking either. Harry hates him, so he sees his bad sides, but as I said earlier, his only real problems are skin and hair. Hooked nose is not a detractor for me personally, I actually like them on men. Adrien Brody is one of my biggest celebrity crushes ever, so I guess I'm weird like that.
