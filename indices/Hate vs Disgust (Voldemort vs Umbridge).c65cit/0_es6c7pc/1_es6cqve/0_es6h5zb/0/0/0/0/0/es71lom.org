I am a huge snape lover and i find that he is irresistably attractive.. due to his personality. I love Alan rickman and find him attractive. But that's not the point. In real life, i came across many people who can and are classified as not beautiful but after getting to know them and liking their personality i got attracted to them and find them actually beautiful after a while.. the opposite is also true.. i found many people who are beautiful in every way, but after hating their personality i couldn't find them beautiful anymore. I love severus snape because of his personality.. greasy hair or not. Hooked nose or not. Alan rickman or book snape. I love his cynical pessisism. I love his snarky personalities and killer sarcasm. I love his passion, whether it is his passion towards potions, towards a cause he believes in or towards a person (lily in canon, harry in my head lol). The snarry i love to read is when severus falls in love with harry's character and i imagine him as such a passionate person. I love that he is morally grey. That he is a realist. That he is a survivor. I can honestly keep talking about the things i love about severus for hours. So his personality makes me see him as desirable and attractive
