Great points. This is why I hate Lady Tremaine out of all the Disney animated villains - she's the most realistic. I don't run into an Ursula or Maleficent in my real life, and if I did they'd be an enemy to fight and call others to join in. But there are all too many Lady Tremaines out there, making everyone's life worse, hurting just a small amount of people each, but there are so many of them, and they act like they aren't wicked, and the people who aren't their victims actually seem to believe this or at least not bother looking too close because it doesn't affect /them/.

Voldemort is like a force of nature - he's strong, and irredeemably evil, and also doesn't actually bother trying to justify his actions - he's very honest about being out for power. There's no point to reason with him, no way you think he could do better, he's just over-the-top evil.

Umbridge though is petty, cruel, stupid - there's no reason she has to be that way, she could be a better person if she wanted to and she doesn't want to, she doesn't care. She paves the way for people like Voldemort.

Imagine the school bully picking on the little kids, but then he's god his own little kid toady behind him laughing at the victims, someone that betrayed the other little kids to cast their lot in with the bully. Don't you hate the toady even more than the bully because they are more like you than the bully is, but just so /twisted/.

In Heinlein's The Puppet Masters, he mentioned that he'd turn from killing the alien slugs invading earth if it meant he could kill one of the humans who joined the alien cause to enslave the human race. The aliens are just that, you want to kill them for trying to enslave you but they're fundamentally unlike you and you could even fight them without hating them. But the toadies and traitors we understand all too well - and despise.

Umbridge betrays every human who wants to live in a peaceful, happy, rational world (not that very many wizards appear to want that but we the readers generally do). This is why we hate her more than Voldemort - Voldemort wasn't ever on our side or pretended to be (at least during the actual story, sure he had a time of pretended respectability but we don't really witness that). Umbridge sits in judgment and betrays all the laws she is supposed to uphold. He's corrupt, she's a liar, she's a traitor, she's a bully.

I really don't like Umbridge.
