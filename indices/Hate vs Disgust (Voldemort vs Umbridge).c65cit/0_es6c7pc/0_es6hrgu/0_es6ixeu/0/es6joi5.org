Which actually reminds me of another thing JKR got right with Umbridge: the fact that she wields the authority of another person, not her own authority.

Umbridges are always seconds-in-command, never the leader. Leaders who carry actual authority cannot get personally involved in unjust situations - when they do, papers have a field day with "X politician made Y decision which resulted in Z sob story" articles. So generally speaking, the Umbridges of the world are acting in someone else's name, with enough independence that the authority-giver can deny the association if injustices come to light.
