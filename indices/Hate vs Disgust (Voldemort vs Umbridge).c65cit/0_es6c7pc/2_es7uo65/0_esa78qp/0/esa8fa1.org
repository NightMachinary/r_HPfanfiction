Well, it's the third in a long series. I do recommend the whole thing, it's great, but that's over a million words and still updating.

If you want to start from the start, it's linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7). If you want to skip to the Chamber of Secrets year, that's linkffn(Identity by MarauderLover7).

There are two main divergence points. The first is that Sirius escaped, more or less by accident, when Harry was nine, and took custody of him (which was fine with the Dursleys, but caused no small uproar in the wizarding world).

The second is that the Malfoys had a second son. And so Lucius decided to play both sides and deliberately condition Draco to bring out Gryffindor traits, in case Harry Potter became important and they wanted someone close to him.
