We would probably hate Tom a lot more than we do if we had the chance to see Ginny's interactions with his diary, where he's properly manipulative and eventually imprisons a conscious Ginny in her own body and puppets her away to the Chamber, but as it is, we just get told briefly after the fact. I came across a fic recently that did a good job of showing Ginny and Tom POV on that year.
