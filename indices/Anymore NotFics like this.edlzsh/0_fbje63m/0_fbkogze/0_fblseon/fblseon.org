I know, I see why Snape doesn't get the job in this timeline. But what I mean is that even in the canon timeline I don't think he was ever /after/ said job; rather, it was foisted upon him by Dumbledore as an excuse to keep him around Hogwarts, both under Dumbledore's close observation and safe from Death Eater reprisals. Meaning he wouldn't actually throw a fit about /not/ getting the job as the line here seems to imply that he would. It would simply never be on his radar to be Potions Master at Hogwarts to begin with.
