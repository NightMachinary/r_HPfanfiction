Oh!

I think the story was saying that no one evinced any interest in him of whatever sort, not even what Dumbledore did in canon.

I see Snape as the sort who desperately craves the care of others, but can never really accept it anymore (maybe after Lily's rejection, maybe from home stuff, or some combination) due to being convinced he is unworthy or because his desperate need would strip him of all defenses if he ever accepted the care of another and he no longer really trusts...or some combination.
