/[[https://pics.me.me/prongsmydeer-the-most-hilarious-thing-about-the-fact-buckbeak-had-42813193.png][Gerald White and the Pair of Glasses]]/ has a very similar energy and is hilarious.

This recommendation is quite good, by the way, but I dispute the following paragraphs:

  -But because he's there, Snape does not manage to get the job, which doesn't help at all with his ‘everyone is out to get me' worldview,
#+end_quote

It's odd that the author borrows the "Dumbledore strongarms the traitor into accepting the Potions Master job at Hogwarts (which the traitor doesnn't really want) so that Dumbledore can keep an eye on him" plot point for Regulus, then proceeds to ignore it regarding Snape. Snape did /not/ want the Potions Master job at Hogwarts IMO.

  -Also, Regulus has a very quiet long-running project with Albus, that they mostly work on in the summers, to the tune of, “Well, if Voldemort had one Horcrux, he probably had others, and we should maybe find them...”
#+end_quote

Without Slughorn's testimony /or/ the fact that the Diary is weirdly unprotected if it's Voldemort's /only/ Horcrux, I don't see how Dumbledore would figure it out.
