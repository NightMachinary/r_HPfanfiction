I like Luna/Dean, and it's /almost/ hinted at in canon. My head canon is that they gave it a try after the war and it didn't really work out, but that they remained lifelong friends.

FF.net has a few options if you search by character, this one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5262925/1/Vita-Perseverat][Dean/Luna]] though rather sad.
