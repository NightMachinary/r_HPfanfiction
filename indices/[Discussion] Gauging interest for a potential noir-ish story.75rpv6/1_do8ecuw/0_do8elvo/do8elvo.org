Thanks! I'm still working out the meat of the plot, although I have a rough finishing point and a general idea of where it's all headed. It'll be in first person, as well as present tense - a style I've not used before, but something I think will work best with the tone and direction I want to take it, as well as Harry's own narrations on what's going on.

That is, if I end up writing it.
