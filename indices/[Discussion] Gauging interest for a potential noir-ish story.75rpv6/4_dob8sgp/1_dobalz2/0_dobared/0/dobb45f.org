Thanks <3

For someone who only has GCSEs in English (dunno what the international or American equivalent is - whatever qualifications you have elsewhere that you sit when you're sixteen) and no higher education in English or Creative Writing, it's really nice to hear that my writing is good from a technical standpoint!

Time-travel stories are basically my Kryptonite for fanfiction too!
