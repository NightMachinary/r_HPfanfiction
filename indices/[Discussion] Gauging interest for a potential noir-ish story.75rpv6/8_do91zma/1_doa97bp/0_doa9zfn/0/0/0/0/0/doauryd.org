Yes, Games Are Afoot is technically complete, yet its ending leaves much to be desired. If you get to the end of it, you'll see what I mean. Also, let me know what you think of them if you do decide to check them out!

Since I'm in the mood for mystery, I'll check out Unatoned first. Thanks for the recommendation!
