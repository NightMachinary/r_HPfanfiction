Thanks! I'll check them out soon. Is Games Are Afoot complete? I really hate getting to the end of an abandoned fic is all.

Regarding my recommendations: they are very different - not necessarily one better than the other. Unatoned is brilliantly written and has good drama/mystery as well as being grey in nature. The marriage contracts one is just humorous. Depends on my mood as to what I would read.
