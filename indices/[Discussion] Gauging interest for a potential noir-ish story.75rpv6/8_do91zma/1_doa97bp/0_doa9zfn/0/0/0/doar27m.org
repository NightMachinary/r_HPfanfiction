That Harry/Daphne story looks interesting. Do you favor this over Unatoned? Or is it vice versa?

My favorite Charlie/Hermione stories are Games Are Afoot and Nocturnal. Games are Afoot starts really well and remains rather incredible for about 90% of the story, but the ending is really weak and disappointing. On the other hand, Nocturnal remains really good throughout as its ending is completely different from its beginning. It also displays some pretty cool imagination from the author as well, which I like. Neither story has any sort of bashing, which is extra bonus points for both of them.
