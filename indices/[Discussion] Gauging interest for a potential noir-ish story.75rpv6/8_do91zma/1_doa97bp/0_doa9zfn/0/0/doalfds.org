Fair enough. She is only mentioned once in the books but as she is one of the only female Slytherins in Harry's year you could easily see him paired with (Pansy, Millicent and Tracey being the other girls), you can see the interest in Harry dating a pure blood Slytherin.

A fun one I really enjoyed (read it over three times) is linkffn(4079609) Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts. Mainly humour but a fun story.

Hermione and Charlie I could see, but it would have to be done well. Otherwise the whole dating Ron's brother thing is a bit hard to swallow. It's like Harry/Tonks, I guess. Any good, complete Hermione/Charlie fics you recommend?
