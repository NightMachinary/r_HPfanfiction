I honestly don't have a great answer for you, in that the pair just never appealed to me. To be honest, I've read the Harry Potter series many times over and I don't recall Daphne anywhere in it. Mind you, I do like odd pairings, namely Charlie Weasley and Hermione Granger, but for some reason, Harry/Daphne just doesn't hold much weight, kind of like Draco/Hermione. I'm willing to give any story a shot, no matter what the pairing is, as "Unatoned" sounded rather intriguing. But I do share a mind with you as there aren't many quality Charlie/Hermione stories out there either.
