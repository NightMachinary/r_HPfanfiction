I put off reading it for months, even though I am a Harry and Daphne fan. I rarely like a first person story and most writers who try their hand at noir or anything like it typically go overboard with the prose and the story creeps along like a dead snail.

However, when I did read it (due to the lack of believable Harry and Daphne fics out there) I actually got lost in the story very quickly. I found the characters were done well and, perhaps most importantly for me, the author did a great job of showing rather than telling. It is a grey story with a suitably grey ending so if you only like warm, fluffy stories or OP/omniscient Harry stories then don't touch it. However, if you enjoy a bit of mystery and intrigue and you don't mind real, believable characters then I'd say go for it.

Out of curiosity, why are you not a Harry and Daphne fan? I found a good story with that pairing when I started read fan fics and have been trying to find quality ones since. I admit, most of the time she is written as Miss Perfect or, even worse, the Ice Queen who is good at everything. However, the idea of Harry dating a Slytherin intrigues me and she's the only name in his year that is left to the imagination who could fit. I could recommend some of my favourites if you like.
