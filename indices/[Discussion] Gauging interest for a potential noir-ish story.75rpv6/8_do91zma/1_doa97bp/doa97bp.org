Harry and Daphne is not my regular cup of tea but the summary was interesting enough. I looked at the reviews and it seems that the story is very polarizing, in that people either love it, with some calling it one of the best pieces they've come across on FF, or abhor it, with many complaining about Harry and Daphne's characterization. What are your thoughts on it?
