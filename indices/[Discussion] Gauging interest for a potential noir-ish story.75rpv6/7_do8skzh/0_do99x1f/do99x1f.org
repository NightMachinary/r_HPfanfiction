You probably wouldn't like where I take it, then - I'm sure they'd feature, but after lots of events in Harry's personal life (the collapse of his - childless - marriage, for instance) and the aforementioned intrigues at the Ministry, coupled with this Harry's own solitary nature, they're no longer the /best/ of friends in the conventional sense. They're still best friends - who wouldn't be, after the events of the series? - but their lives have moved on a lot and Harry's... hasn't.

I wanted them to have a minor role in this story, at least for most of it. That's not to say they won't become important later, but in my mind this would be a heavily Harry-centric story, and for me to pursue the character direction I see it going in, he's best suited being separated from the trio for the most part.
