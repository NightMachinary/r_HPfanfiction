That does sound interesting. Reminds me a little bit of the Dirty Harry movie "Magnum Force" where Dirty Harry uncovered corruption that went all the way to the top. I'm interested in the background--why are Harry's friends distant? Why is his department on the fringe? What happened to the legend of the Boy Who Lived? Is he being set up by the head of the Auror department? By the Minister? He has to have someone on his side or else this will get real grim--sort of how Miller has Julie Mao, even if she is only a figment of his imagination. Who will be on Harry's side? Is it someone he wronged and he has to redeem himself to? I see potential for him pairing up with a scrappy reporter--maybe someone who grew up on the stories about Harry Potter and still believes in him. Lots of potential in this idea!
