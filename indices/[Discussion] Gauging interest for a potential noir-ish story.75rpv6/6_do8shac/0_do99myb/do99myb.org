Magnum Force is the best Dirty Harry movie, hands down.

I like the idea of a scrappy reporter - with how I was going to involve the press anyway in the plot, such a thing wouldn't be out of place. Thanks for the idea, I'll see what I can come up with, although I do agree that Harry is gonna need at least some support, as much as I like leaving him on his own.

In terms of the background info, I'm still working a lot out - I didn't really want it to be a trio story, so I'm still developing how he could've become distant from Ron and Hermione, although I'm definitely leaning towards some kind of intrigue in the Ministry that happened early on in their careers, which led to the other two leaving its employ or just beginning to accept 'the way things are'.

For Harry, though, I wanted to put him in a nominal role in the Auror Dept, but not as a full-time field Auror. Instead, due to the machinations of higher-ups in the Ministry (for me, the idea is that Harry was too idealistic, too driven to create change and his investigations slightly /too/ thorough for some of the people at the top of the food chain) he's the sole officer of the /Pertinent Investigations Office/, essentially half cold-case room and half-archive, it's the dumping ground for Aurors that disturb the food chain too much, but are too competent or high-profile to fire completely.

In the end, the world has moved past the legend of the Boy-Who-Lived. He never made it to Auror-Captain (my replacement term for Head Auror) and Shacklebolt was replaced as Minister by someone far more /agreeable/ to certain interests early on. As a result, there are people high up in the Ministry's workings who have grudges against Harry, be it for the events of the series, or a certain investigation of his, or just because he's grown stubborn and unpleasant on top of already not accepting bribes or the like. He's a thorn in the side of a smoothly-running Ministry, but he's still slightly too important, and too good at his job as head of the PIO to be let go from the Auror Office completely.
