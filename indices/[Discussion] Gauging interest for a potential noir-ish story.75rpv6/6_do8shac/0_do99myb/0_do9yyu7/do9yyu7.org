I really like this idea. I like the idea that the world has moved on past him and he still hasn't really come to grips with what that means or how it could ultimately free him. He only knows one way to be, so that's how he is, rather like Roland Deschain. I think describing him as an Auror that is too competent or high-profile to simply fire is excellent.

This is a great setup for a wonderful character arc. Harry is initially presented as bitter, run down and all alone in the world, but through this case (and maybe the scrappy reporter) he realizes he doesn't have to be. I admit to being guilty of being too much in love with Harry to not see him succeed, but I think there is great potential in this setup.
