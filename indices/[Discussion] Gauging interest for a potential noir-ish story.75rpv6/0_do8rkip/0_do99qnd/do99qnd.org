Fair enough, apart from /The Sum of Their Parts/ I've never really enjoyed stories that follow that pattern. Although many of them have great ideas and satisfying moments, too many of them read - to me - like power-fantasies or bash-the-entire-wizarding-world to be entertaining. That and only a few of them make destroying the Ministry a challenge.

Thanks for taking the time to add your thoughts though, even with a different opinion!
