There's always an audience for any type of story, no matter what kind it takes. I mean, have you seen some of the requests made here and what some authors are posting on FF at least? Your premise is definitely promising but I'd caution you to have an ending to your story before you start posting (if you decide to actually go through with it). You don't have to have all the details laid out but a clear and concise ending is important for this mystery/"noir-ish" story in which you can use as a compass to lead you to the end. Good luck!
