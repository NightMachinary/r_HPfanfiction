But that's assuming they have the same moral guidelines as the Muggle world. The main complaint against homosexuality is that religion has declared it a sin against the sacred act of marriage. In the wizarding world, Purebloods put more emphasis on blood line rather than the concept of family (see Gaunts and Blacks). Marriage isn't based on love, it's a political game. I could see them arranging marriages for the sole reason of producing the desired offspring. I highly doubt the Malfoys actually "love" each other, and the Lestranges also seemed to have a loveless marriage as well. What they do with their extra time is unimportant. They probably turn a blind eye to any sort of affair (including homosexuality) as long as they still bear proper children. I guess they technically wouldn't like it as much, but it would be a lesser crime in comparison to breeding (producing children) with "unclean" individuals...which would be the bigger problem in such a tiny community.

Also, those people are the "extremists" of their world, and they hardly make up for the majority of the wizarding population. For the most part, I always got the impression that other wizards were pretty lax. The only things that most people seemed to agree on was the statute of secrecy.

I think the reason werewolves are hated so much is that they are no longer purebloods (aka "not worthy), but they also have the terrifying ability to give another person that dreaded status.
