I think that it wouldn't be accepted solely for the purpose that the pure blood lords have to continue their line or if the are muggle born, start their line towards becoming pure bloods. Homosexuality just would not fly because of the prejudice. If the magical world is as prejudiced as they are against half bloods (for example werewolves) and muggle borns, they would be equally as prejudiced against homosexuals
