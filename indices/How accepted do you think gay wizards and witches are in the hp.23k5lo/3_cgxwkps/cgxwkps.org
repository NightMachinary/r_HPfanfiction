In terms of magical society? I'd say probably not that accepted at all. Think about it. The magical community is fucking /tiny/, and doesn't seem to be expanding anytime soon. One of the most reliable ways to produce more magical people is to have /already/ magical people reproduce. While it's never mentioned in the books, I just can't see a society actively accepting homosexuality, when they're already an incredibly tiny part of the general population, and in doing so would make it harder to increase that number.

For the trio? Meh, it's pretty hard to guess at. I can't see Hermione being hateful about it, and even Harry to some degree probably wouldn't care all that much. Ron? Eh, I dunno. I could see him having a problem with it. He's from a traditional family, from a society where (at least in my mind) homosexuality wouldn't be openly accepted. I can't see him taking it well.
