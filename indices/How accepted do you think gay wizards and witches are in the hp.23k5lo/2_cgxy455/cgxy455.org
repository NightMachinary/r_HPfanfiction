I love this question!

Alright, so I basically just have assumptions, and I also love what [[/u/silver_fire_lizard]] said, so I'm going to try to keep this a bit short (ha....yeah right).

Overall, I think that homosexuality would, generally, be accepted or at least acknowledged. I think t.hat most families would be accepting of gay children/loved ones, like the Weasleys, but there would be problems with Pureblood families. Either they could despise homosexuality, or they may take a Spartan approach. "Have your fun same-sex relationships as much as you want, but you better marry the opposite sex and procreate". So they may be accepting of homosexual relationships, but only if the individual still "does their duty", marries the opposite sex, and procreates.

This leads to, what I think could be, the larger problem. Gay marriage. Pre-war, I think gay marriage would be a huge no-no. You have these Pureblood families basically running the Ministry and they want Pureblood babies. Can't have Pureblood babies between two men or women. So they would never let pro-gay marriage bills pass. Post-war, however, is a different story. Voldemort is gone, people feel freer, but the wizarding population has been hit. I think gay marriage would be much more possible, especially since Kingsley seems quite awesome, but I think there may be restrictions or rules, such as obliging the partners to adopt orphans who lost their parents in the war. At least, I'm writing it that way in my marriage-law fic. So, basically, gay marriage would be more accepting post-war.

So, I think gay relationships would be accepted, but the couples would face the same problems as Muggles. Ron would definitely be worried about his family. Will his parents be disappointed? Will Fred and George make fun of him? (I think they would be very accepting). Will Percy be disgusted? Will Ginny be ashamed? All of these thoughts will fill his mind and he will have to confront these fears at some point.

I feel that Harry and Hermione would be very accepting. Harry is a very open individual who even managed to develop a slightly positive relationship with Draco at the end. Hermione is very loving and I think she would say "Oh Ron, we still love you no matter what." She would hug him and wish him the best. Unless they were in a relationship, then she might feel some pain and maybe even anger/guilt/self-hate depending on HOW he told her. I think that even the other Gryffindors would be accepting. Neville would be kind and open. Dean would probably be quite open. But Seamus may have difficulties. We've seen him have difficulties adapting to unique situations before, so he would definitely be taken aback and feel awkward. He might need some time to think about it.

On a side note: Luna would freakin' love it.

I think that Harry would have a tough time trying to protect Ron from the seducer. Ron may think Harry isn't accepting of his sexuality, so that could cause a major confrontation. Harry would have to find a way to protect Ron without offending or insulting him. And they are also very bull-headed. Hermione may have to play the neutral party or as a balancer, trying to explain to Ron that they don't care about his sexuality but they do care that he's being used.

I think that it would be fantastic to have a scene where Dumbledore provides lovely advice to Ron about his sexuality. He wouldn't come right out and say he's gay, but it would be hidden within the conversation.

Alright, I wasn't brief. I apologize. So, in general, the community might be quite accepting save Purebloods. Hermione and Harry will love Ron no matter what. And Ron will face the same problems as any other gay teenager, Wizard or Muggle: self-doubt, bullying, coming out, family reactions, etc. But he would be loved dearly regardless of his sexual preferences.

Sorry for the wall of text. I got excited. Tl; dr: I wrote it out, just please read it. Thanks.
