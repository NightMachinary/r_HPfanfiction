I think I read that JK Rowling said he wasn't gay in an interview. There's so little information on him in the books that he could easily be homosexual, but he could just as easily be heterosexual or asexual. I don't know if I would make a case for him as an example of sexual diversity with the lack of information and the interview stating otherwise.
