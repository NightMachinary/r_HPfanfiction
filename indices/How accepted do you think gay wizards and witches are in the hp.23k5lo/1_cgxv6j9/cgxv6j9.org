Oh wow, this is a really interesting discussion! I can't provide anything better than opinions, but I felt like jumping in anyway. There's certainly a lot of hints to people possibly being gay, but nothing outright in the story. Also, we don't hear much about Harry's everyday life, and it's likely that drama over minor characters got sacrificed for plot (we all knew that random kid who came out in high school - excellent gossip for a total of like three hours, but mostly insignificant unless it was more personal). Overall, I think the wizarding world would be pretty accepting, but extremist purebloods would probably hate it because it could endanger the bloodlines (although a lesser evil compared to marrying Muggles).

I personally feel like the trio would be very accepting. The only person I could see having a few issues is Ron (who is generally sensitive and might be afraid of uncomfortable confrontations). However, since your character IS Ron, this probably isn't an issue. Harry would be okay to an extent, but if Ron was seduced, Harry would probably catch on and try to stop it from happening. The big question is how would Ron act? He'd probably be very defensive and irrational that his friends are questioning his new choice of companion (even though they just don't like the person, not the fact that it's a guy). Ron might see Harry and Hermione's actions as a personal attack...once again, because he's sensitive.

If Ron and Hermione were in a romantic relationship, she would of course be crushed by his betrayal. I'm going to guess that they are just friends in your story, so I would say that Hermione would take it in much the same fashion that Harry would...although she would be more apt to "giving in" out of frustration. She would accept that the new person is part of the group, but I can see her making excuses to avoid being in the same company as this new person.

I'm of course assuming that Harry and Hermione don't like this person because you used the word 'seduced'.

Not part of your discussion, but my personal headcanon is that Albus Severus is gay...although I can't make up my mind whether I want to put him with Scorpius Malfoy or not. It's not that I'm against it, I just LOVE the idea of Scorpius and Rose Weasley together. The drama would be hilarious.
