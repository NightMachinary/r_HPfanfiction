It's an interesting idea since, although bigotry is a very central part of the plot and the key issue of the entire war, regular forms of discrimination are almost nonexistent.

The wizarding world is extremely gender-neutral, with many witches in high positions as well as wizards. As well as all sports teams being mixed gender.

Even racism is practically unheard of, With Blaise being a black kid in Slytherin house and Malfoy doesn't care as long as his mom is a pureblood.

So we don't know how they feel about sexuality nor can we really deduct that since their racism is more [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism][fantastic]].

Then again, it would be hilarious if all the purebloods found it perfectly normal while the muggleborns were the ones making a big deal out of it... Switch things around for once.
