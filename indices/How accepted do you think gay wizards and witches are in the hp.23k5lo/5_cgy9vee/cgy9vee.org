This ended up /way/ longer than I intended, so *tl;dr*: write reactions to homosexuality in whatever way is best for your story. Sometimes homophobia is relevant to the plot, and sometimes it's not.

Because homosexuality isn't covered in the books, you've got the freedom to approach it in whatever manner you prefer--or rather, whichever manner works best for your story. I've written fic where I wrote the wizarding world as accepting because the gay relations of the characters weren't the main issue, and I had enough in the story without adding subplots of characters dealing with homophobia and the various difficulties associated with a teenager accepting their sexuality. But in a different story I have included homophobia because the characters dealing with their sexuality is a major theme, so I wrote things similiar to how I've experienced real world homophobia.

But overall? I tend to lean towards the idea of, as several others have mentioned, homosexuality being something that's acceptable only as an aside to marriage and producing children. That said, I do think it'd be a little more complicated than that and different among the various political sides. Families like the Blacks and Malfoy, I think, would take the view of: "You can bugger other men all you like, just do it behind closed doors, don't talk about it, and don't let anyone find out." I think that in the case of an arranged marriage where affairs are practically expected, having one with someone of the same sex would be less acceptable than having one with someone of the opposite sex.

With people like the Weasleys, I actually think it'd be more complex because I can't see them as the type to do arranged marriages. They're obviously very big on True Love^{TM} so the idea of having an affair, with anyone, would be frowned upon. I think they would be accepting of someone being queer, but within the family I do think they might react to a child's coming out with "Are you /sure/ you like the same sex? Maybe you just haven't found the right person yet" or "Perhaps it's just a phase" and similar type things. (Which, make no mistake, can be just as damaging as "You're not gay, I won't have any gay children in /my/ house!" type reactions.) I don't think there would be any outright nastiness or intended homophobia, but I do think the Weasleys, Molly in particular, might take some time accepting that one of them is gay, and possibly only do so after the gay person has snapped at them.

All of this, of course, is about the purebloods. Things are likely to be different for the Muggleborns (and half-bloods from more Muggle orientated backgrounds). I was only a kid in the 90s (and a particularly unperceptive one) so I don't recall general attitudes towards gay people then, only that it was never an issue in my own family. If you're aiming for realism, you may want to do some research into it and base Muggleborn attitudes on whatever your research reveals. Otherwise I would say just write them with the kind of attitudes that are prevalent today.

That said, I do think it'd be safe to say the Dursleys aren't going to be accepting. They hate everything that doesn't fit their tiny little world view and homosexuality is definitely going to be outside. With regards to how this affects Harry's opinions, specifically in reaction to Ron, I think it'd be kind of simple to be honest. Dursley=bad, Ron=good; Dursley=anti-gay, Ron=gay; thus gay=good.

Hermione could go either way, I think. She's clearly open minded about most things, but homosexuality can often be one of those things that seemingly rational people have issues with. It wouldn't be completely implausible to write her family as generally homophobic. Probably not "gays are evil and must die" type thing, but the kind that pretend it doesn't exist and if it happens in the family is a shameful secret to be hidden/ignored. With that attitude in reaction to Ron, I think it'd be along the lines of: "You're gay? Oh... I need to go think very long and hard about this and decide if what my parents taught me is right or should be ignored because homosexuality is no longer an abstract that I've never come face to face with." With her, I'd say write her reaction in whatever way is best for your story, and as other people have said her reaction will be influenced by whether there's any romance between her and Ron.

As to reactions within Hogwarts, that's again more complex because, as you said, teenagers can be more open to experimenting. Unfortunately they can also be more cruel. Those who come from unaccepting families are going to react with the same bullying you get in Muggle kids. Whatever route you take, there is always going to be at least one person who's homophobic, but whether that person shows up in your story to hassle the gay character depends on whether you want to write about the issue of homophobic bullying. Also keep in mind that homophobia doesn't always come in extreme terms of "you filthy faggot" and "I'm going to +beat you up+ hex you because you're gay"; sometimes it's just "I'm not changing in the same room as a gay person" and "I don't care if you're gay, just don't snog your boyfriend in front of me" (meanwhile the speaker ignores a straight couple snogging in the middle of the common room, so their issue clearly isn't public displays of affection).

On the teacher side of things, obviously there's going to be a rule somewhere that they're not supposed to judge students but that's also obviously not going to necessarily hold up. I'm pretty sure most of them won't react openly in anyway beyond, perhaps, some surprised blinking and mouth-gaping when they stumble across Ron snogging a boy in an abandoned classroom, but would then get a hold of themselves and take points and send them on their way as they would for a straight couple. (Then probably run off to the staff room to gossip, because I believe that's what teachers do.)

Exceptions to this rule will be Dumbledore--who probably already knows and smiles benignly, but comes down hard on anyone he catches bullying people for their sexuality--and Snape, if you write him as homophobic. While I don't think he would outright call a student faggot or anything, I do think he'd step up his general nastiness towards them. (If you disagree, consider that he never explicitly mentioned anything about Hermione's parentage, as far as I recall, but was generally horrible to her. Same goes for Neville; Snape probably knows about what happened to the Longbottoms, but he's never used it against Neville in class, despite the fact that he could be unbelievably cruel by saying something about Neville's intelligence being "as good as your brain-dead parents".)

As for the seduction issue... if the OC wants into Harry's circle of friends then (if he's competent) he's going to seduce Ron in a way that makes him seem friendly and great. He's going to endear himself to Harry and Hermione while doing the seduction, because his overall goal won't be achieved if he treats Ron (openly at least) in a way that Harry and Hermione don't like. Difficulties will come when Harry and Hermione realise that the OC is only using Ron and they try to convince him of it. Also consider whether Ron's relationship cuts into hanging out time with his mates, which may make them (Harry in particular) feel abandoned. In such an instance, when they try convincing Ron that the OC is using him, Ron's likely to react with "You're just jealous because I'm spending time with him instead of you!" and then there might be a falling out of GoF proportions, which may affect the OC's plan--he can't get close to Harry if Ron and Harry are no longer speaking.

Similar thing could happen if Hermione has feelings for Ron, falling out occurs, only this time based on "You're just jealous because you fancy me!" but such a falling out would be between Ron and Hermione, which wouldn't affect the OC's plan as much.
