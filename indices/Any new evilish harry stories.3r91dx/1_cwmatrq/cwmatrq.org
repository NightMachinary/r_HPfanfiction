I'm copypasting from another comment I was writing. The first fic isn't that recent, but the second one is. I linked both becuase they're part of a series.

  This one is... unique. That's the best way I can describe it. On an unrelated note, did you know Harry was the 5th founder of Hogwarts and the inventor of the inferii? Or that Voldemort can squeal like a 14 year old girl who's just seen Beiber? Oh, and this story has the cutest dementors ever.

  The prequel to the one above this. It starts out as your normal everyday Azkaban fic with the oh lordy why me pity party in my cell I have no friends so I guess nobody's invited thing with a side of bashing, but HOLY SHIT does that change.
