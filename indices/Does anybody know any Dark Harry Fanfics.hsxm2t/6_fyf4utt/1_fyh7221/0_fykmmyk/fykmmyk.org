Alright, first are stories where Harry uses dark magic but like isn't really a bad person Linkffn(on the way to greatness) Linkffn(Harry Potter and the boy who lived) linkffn(bloodcrest) tentatively linkffn(a cadmean victory) and linkffn(prince of the dark kingdom) for ritualistic magic and darker characters. PotDK says no dark!harry but that's kinda relative due to the fact that he's mentored by Voldemort.

For the latter linkffn(equal and opposite) linkffn(traitorous) as well as prisoners cypher that I rec'ed earlier

I'd put linkffn(for the lack of a bezoar) and linkffn(Betrayal by butalearner) somewhere in the middle

It might not really be what you're looking for but linkffn(beyond the curtain) has a very dark atmosphere

I hear lots of good things about linkffn(the sum of their parts) but I've never read it so so I can't really recommend it
