That reminds me of an mausing prompt someone suggested, that was never finished: what if Bellatrix had been insane enough that the modified Gemino Curse on the Cup /never stopped/? Three months after the Trio's break-in at Gringotts, planet Earth is enterred in an increasingly thick pile of rapidly-modifying Hufflepuff's Cups. Society has collapsed along with the Statute of Secrecy, and now wizards (some of whom now live in floating cities /above/ the rising level of cups) comprise most of the survivors, desperately looking for how to cancel the spell.
