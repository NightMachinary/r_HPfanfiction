The Get Hermione Out Of The Way trope.

Lots of stories I've read that aren't H/Hr e.g. Harry/Daphne, Harry/Fleur, etc feel the need to end Harry and Hermione's friendship They usually do this by turning Hermione into a terrible person who abandons Harry at the first sign of rule-breaking or not doing his homework or something.
