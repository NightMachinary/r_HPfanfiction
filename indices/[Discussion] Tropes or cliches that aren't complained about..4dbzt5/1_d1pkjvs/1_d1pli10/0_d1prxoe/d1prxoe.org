I don't even care about whether it's a joke or cliche. Simply the fact that they are common names for Hermione's parents means they are easily recognizable. When an author introduces "Dan and Emma" I automatically know who they're talking about. Other names at this point are just confusing and thus detract from the story.

The worst thing an author can do is give them names that are shared by other characters.
