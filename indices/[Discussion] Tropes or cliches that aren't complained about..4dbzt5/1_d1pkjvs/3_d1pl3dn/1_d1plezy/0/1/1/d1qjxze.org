Of course, there are a few well-written H/Hr stories. My point was that /Harmonians/ (the militant H/Hr shippers) don't produce those good H/Hr stories. Often, they've got too much resentment from previous fan-wars, that they seem to have a need to /prove/ why H/Hr is the best pairing. And when authors try to do that, they almost always take down the Weasleys, which I've never seen done well until now.
