Well, the thing is, most people who use Dan and Emma are Harmonians. And you normally don't want to be associated with Harmony, seeing that there are no well-written H/Hr stories by militant shippers. It's mostly that people are sick of Hermione's parents being in the story with no real purpose than seeing how great of a fit Harry and Hermione are (I'm looking at you, Robst).
