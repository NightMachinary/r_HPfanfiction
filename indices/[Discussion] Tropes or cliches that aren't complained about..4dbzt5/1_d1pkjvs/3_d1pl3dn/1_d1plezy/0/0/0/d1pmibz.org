Well, people have their own tastes, and you'll find haters for pretty much every pairing if you look close enough. The problem is, some pairings are much more infamous than others, for various reasons. H/Hr is one of them, because many of these fics are accompanied by manipulative Dumbledore, Weasley bashing, OTP preaching ("Harry and Hermione were obviously meant to be, and anyone who denies this fact is delusional"), and so forth.

Some other pairings that are often condemned are slash fics, especially Harry/Snape and Harry/Malfoy. On top of my head, Harem, D/Hr, and SS/Hr have a bad rep for being generally of lesser quality. Finally, there are the fucked up pairings (I've read a Dumbledore/Harry one once) that either result in general disgust or general lulz.
