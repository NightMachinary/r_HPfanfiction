I agree. They're usually just there to be disapproving or play matchmaker for a scene or two. Possibly they're there to be the straight man to the /hilarious/ wizard high jinks /s Regardless, they're not really characters, and the story would have been fine without them.

I did see a fic - a long, long time ago, so I don't remember the name - where they were 'Dean and Elizabeth Granger', which I found marginally more acceptable. Sharing initials is at least less 'in your face' about it.
