Luna's hidden value is discovered, but old habits die hard. "Loo--Luna," they say, catching themselves at the last moment, as though her given name and its diminutive did not lead with phonetically identical syllables.

An adult (one of Hermione's parents, perhaps, or a sympathetic professor) silently reflects that something about Harry makes him seem so much older than his age; it's probably the look in his eyes. His suffering is immeasurable! Their very heart breaks.

Daphne Greengrass has no relevance to plot or bit role better filled by someone with greater canon presence; is shoehorned in anyway.

Ron fucks up romantically; this contrasts Harry's instinctive relationship expertise and general chivalry.

Harry, plaintive, reflects on the loss of "Lupin, Tonks, Fred, Colin, and /so many others/"; is incapable of naming a single other casualty of the final battle.

Hermione's favorite novel is /Pride and Prejudice/; is also a repressed romantic waiting for some gallant to carry her off into the sunset.

A prescient house-elf implies romantic relationship between still-oblivious romantic leads whose only roadblock to true love is another ten chapters of angst.
