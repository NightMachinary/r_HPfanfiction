I think that Hermione, if she /did/ have a "favorite novel", it would be /Jane Eyre/, if only because it requires the woman (Jane) to "rescue" the man (Rochester) at the end of the book. Jane also shares some traits that would resonate with Hermione, such as valuing education and learning; being brave and courageous; and having "plain" looks.
