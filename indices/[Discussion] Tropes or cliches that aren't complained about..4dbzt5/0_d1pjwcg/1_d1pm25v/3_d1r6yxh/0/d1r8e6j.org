I've often imagined that each of the trio have a favourite book. Hermione's favourite book, like [[/u/Obversa]] said, to be Jane Eyre for the reasons he/she said; post-War Harry's is probably something like Slaughterhouse-Five because of the similarities between himself and the protagonist of that book; and Ron probably doesn't understand muggle fiction, but if he did, he'd probably like some absurdist humour like Catch-22.
