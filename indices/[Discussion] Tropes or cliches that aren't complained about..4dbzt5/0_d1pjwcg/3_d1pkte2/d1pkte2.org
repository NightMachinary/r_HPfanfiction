I feel like you've been keeping this a bit pent up lol. I've seen complaints about Daphne, although I'll admit she's a guilty pleasure of mine.

And what do you mean Mr. Harry Potter Sir's miss grangy/wheezy/loveygood/etc... Is cliche.

I can only think of one off the top of my head where Hermione's favorite book is Pride and Prejudice... /cough/ Harry Crow /cough/

To be fair on the Luna one I've seen similar happen in real life. You start out meaning to say something, but change it to something identically sounding for the first syllable. I'll primarily see Ron and Hermione doing that one though.
