I can't recall specifics, but the best explanation I think I've seen is that it was because of his will power and he wasn't aware of it at the time. He could resist the imperius, but he had to realize what was happening, at the world cup he was unaware it was happening. Afterwards he hears about the veela and their charm, probably from Hermione and Molly. Fleur comes around and then all of a sudden he feels it again and is able to resist the urge subconsciously.
