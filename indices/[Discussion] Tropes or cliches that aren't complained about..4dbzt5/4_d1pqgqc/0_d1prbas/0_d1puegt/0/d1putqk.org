Yes, but the whole Fleur being quarter-Veela* or full-Veela is fanon. In canon she is just very pretty, and it's never outright stated she uses some kind of supernatural allure on others. Ron is just as likely unable to speak around her because of being a teenaged boy.

*as in, quarter-Veela giving her powers somehow.
