Reminds me of Harry being immune to the Veela charm, because he is so in love with author's favourite romantic partner.

Never addresses Harry falling under the Veela charm at the World Cup like the others and is merely based on how he seems to be able to act around Fleur, who is never stated to actually be Veela in canon.
