Fred and George Weasley. There is the Gred and Forge names plus their tendency to complete the other's sentences which was not a very dominant Canon trait. It would have been better to alternate sentences.

If the author wants to Weasley bash and go the whole mile in the trifecta of Ron, Molly and Ginny, they are often the only "good" Weasleys, shocked at the actions of their families. If they are asked to prank someone, they have the omniscient tendency to prank only the "deserving", nevermind that such pranking is no better than bullying.
