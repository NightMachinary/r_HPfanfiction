Harry goes gray/dark and gets a new wand trope. As if a person weilding a phoenix feather core wand cant change themselves over the course of their life. Phoenixes being a creature of the light trope is bad too. The only phoenix we see in canon is Fawkes who seems to only guve a fuck about Dumbledore.
