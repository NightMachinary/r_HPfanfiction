I thought the books stated that Phoenix cries caused pain to dark wizards.

On the wand, Voldemort had and used a feather that was identical to Harry's same bird and all, so when the wand core restricts a person's ability to cast a certain magic that bugs me. If it won't work as well is acceptable, but it would have to be pretty hidden wand lore for that to be true.
