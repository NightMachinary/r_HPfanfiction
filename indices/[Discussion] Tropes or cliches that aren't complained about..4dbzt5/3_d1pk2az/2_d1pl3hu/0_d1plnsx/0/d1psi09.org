Checked the first chapter of DH--Lucius withdraws the wand from his robes. No cane!

And I'm 99.9% sure that Draco's middle name is never mentioned. I can't think of any scene in which it would fit...

I only checked the scene where Lucius first appears in CoS, but his clothes aren't described at all. When he reappears in the scene at Hagrid's hut, he is described as wearing a traveling cloak. And Fudge is wearing "an odd assortment of clothes," which includes a pinstriped suit.
