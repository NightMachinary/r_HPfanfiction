I don't have the books at hand, so I can't double check any of this, but I'm.../98.3%/ sure that Lucius in the books was described as drawing his wand out of his coat or waistcoat in DH, not a cane, and that he was described as wearing a pinstripe suit when he first appeared in CoS. I could be wrong, as I said, but I'm almost sure that Lucius in fancy robes with long hair and a wand stored in a cane like a sword were all Jason Isaacs's suggestions. I vaguely recall an interview where he said he was disappointed with their sketches of the pinstripe suit costume and made all of those suggestions because, you know, he got to play a /wizard/ - why shouldn't he?

Maybe someone with access to the books can confirm this stuff for us. :) I'm only 70-ish% sure of the Draco thing, but since I can't check right now, you could totally be right and I just need to sit in my corner for a while. ;)
