Yep, which is what I meant when I said using the film versions of costumes and stuff. /shrug/

I suppose if it's in a Spanish version of one of the books, maybe it's tentative canon? My only real objection is that it's boring and seems to be based on people copying each other, rather than looking for evidence like we're doing. Just once, I'd like to see a Draco Tiberius Orion Malfoy, just because someone felt like it. ;) haha
