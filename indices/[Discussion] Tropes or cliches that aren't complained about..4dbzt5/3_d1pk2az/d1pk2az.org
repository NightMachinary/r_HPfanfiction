'Draco Lucius Malfoy'. I could be wrong, as my memory isn't as great as some, but I don't think Draco had a middle name in canon. Yet authors do this all the time (often accompanied by 'Lucius Abraxas Malfoy') and nobody seems to mind. I don't mind, per se, but a little creativity on that front would be nice to see occasionally.

Or he could just not have a middle name. Not everyone does, and they aren't sitting around mourning the lack.

Only other one I can think of offhand is using the film versions of appearances, costumes, etc. I don't recall seeing anyone complain about it when Lucius is mentioned to have a cane, or Hogwarts ties are mentioned. Of course, I might just not have noticed people complaining....
