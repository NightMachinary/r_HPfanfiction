Meh, that's really the most minor form of OC in fanfics. You don't expect fanfiction to use only spells used in the series, right? and obviously there are many spells in the HP world which we didn't see used.

Also, in the beginning of HBP, Molly uses a charm on a pot of soup to make it hot - it's probably a boiling charm rather than simple warming, but it's a similar result. I see nothing wrong with warming charms - it's spells like "Tempus" that I hate.
