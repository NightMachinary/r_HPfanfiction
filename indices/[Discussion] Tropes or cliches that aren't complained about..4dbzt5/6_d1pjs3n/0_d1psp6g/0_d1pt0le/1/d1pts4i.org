Oh, I thought the point of the question was "tropes or cliches that aren't complained about BUT SHOULD BE", maybe I was wrong.

I don't think that the lack of use of a certain charm in a circumstance it is needed in canon necessarily invalidates it - see Aberforth who was cleaning glasses with a dirty towel, and has a filthy pub, despite the existence of cleaning charms. Also, I think the use of Gillyweed protected Harry against the cold, but I don't remember the scene so well.
