I thought that was the point of the question- 'What isn't canon but not irritating enough for people to complain about it'. I don't mind the use of it because it seems like the most natural use of magic imaginable after 'create a fire'.

It's only prominent in my mind because I recall no mention of adaptations to the cold made by half of the competitors in the TriWizard Tournament, despite the fact that they were diving into a Scots Loch in mid-February. It's necessary, yet there's a hole in the canon.
