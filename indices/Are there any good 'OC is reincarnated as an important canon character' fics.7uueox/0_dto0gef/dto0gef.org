Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance is the first that comes to mind. It a about Salazar Slytherin being reincarnated and Hermione, and the gradual restoration of Slytherin house. Would definitely recommend it - so far year 3 just finished, and the author is still working on it (although hasn't been updated for a few months).
