Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.

But to be fair: he got lectures from Dumbledore that did help to defeat Voldemort - it wasn't like it would have helped if Harry started "training" like he does in so many fanfics. You have to be realistic here: Harry is an above average wizard, but nothing more. Voldemort on the other hand was one of the most brillant wizards that ever lived. He had perfect control over his magic even before he started Hogwarts. He could fight Dumbledore to a stillstand. He had 50 years more experience. It wasn't like training could fill the gap.

The only thing I agree with you is that Harry didn't grieve Sirius enough. We see a little bit at the end of OotP and there are some weeks between book 5 and 6 - but that isn't enough.
