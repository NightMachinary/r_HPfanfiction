  included some memories of the first war

Why? It was never Harrys job to fight a war. His job was finding Horkruxes to kill Voldemort. Showing him fights from his parents or Sirius would only have Harry tempted to fight himself.

  teach Harry some basic camping/survival spells.

I seriously don`t think that Dumbledore thought they would have to go that deep on the run. I mean: the Order had multiple safe houses when Dumbledore died. They mostly didn't trust them because of all the things Snape knew. But it was never the plan that Snape was so cut of from the Order! The only reason everyone knew that Snape killed Dumbledore was that Harry was there - and that wasn't part of the plan.
