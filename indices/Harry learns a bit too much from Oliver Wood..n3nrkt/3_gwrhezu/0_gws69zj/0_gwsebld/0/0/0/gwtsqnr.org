  Why? It was never Harrys job to fight a war. His job was finding Horkruxes to kill Voldemort. Showing him fights from his parents or Sirius would only have Harry tempted to fight himself.

Not fighting. Surviving.

Memories of Death Eater raids, ambushes, propaganda... What tactics they used in the Rise and might use again. What to watch for if someone might be coerced or under a curse. Spotting potential allies, scouting, avoiding Dark hotspots. Taboo.

It feels to me like the situation didn't fully sink in for Harry until halfway through book 7, and I'd have liked to see him aware of what exactly he was fighting and having some basic capability to seek help - even if just to resupply. Dumbledore, who both experienced the events himself and has friends who did could have done much to prevent Harry from stumbling around like a drunk from trap to trap.

  I seriously don`t think that Dumbledore thought they would have to go that deep on the run. I mean: the Order had multiple safe houses when Dumbledore died. They mostly didn't trust them because of all the things Snape knew. But it was never the plan that Snape was so cut of from the Order! The only reason everyone knew that Snape killed Dumbledore was that Harry was there - and that wasn't part of the plan.

If that is the initial premise, Dumbledore should have fallen in the Rise, or to Grindewald. No plan survives the contact with the enemy, that's why they're called the enemy.

Relying on a single plan never works and someone of Dumbledore's age and with his life experiences would know that. Even if Dumbledore trusted Snape, he saw that he was the only one, so any plan where Order would be relying on Snape without Dumbledore around to vouch for him didn't fit with the information available.

And finally, Dumbledore had enough problems with the Ring that he should have assumed a similar level of protection/danger. With St. Mungo's being too public and Snape unwilling to provide healing potions for all safehouses even if he had been able (he wouldn't be, not with his other duties), at least ways of obtaining the ingredients should be mentioned, or reference material provided. Getting food, dressing woulds... The basics, something to buy time.

Relying on Hermione ex Machina leaves sour taste in my mouth.

And even disregarding the above, giving Harry a few simple, but universally useful spells to practice would give him a sense of accomplishment and distracted him from Malfoy - a matter Dumbledore wanted Harry to drop. Which is something Dumbledore could have realistically thought of, since he'd been a teacher and then headmaster for a while.
