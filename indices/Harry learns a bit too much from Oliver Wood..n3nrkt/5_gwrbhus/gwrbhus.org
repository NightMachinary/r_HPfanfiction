/This is what my very sleep deprived brain concocted./

"I betcha the Lestrange brothers support the Tutshills," grumbled Harry darkly. Hermione rolled her eyes. Harry had long since surpassed Ron in making annoying statements about Tutshill supporters. In Harry's mind, it seemed that supporting the Tornadoes inevitably meant you also supported Voldemort. She blamed Wood fully.

"Er, mate, I don't think they really care about Quidditch too much. Too busy doing Death Eater stuff y'know." said Ron, drumming his fingers on the table. Harry scoffed and reached towards his friend.

"Of course. Bloody Tutshill fans only care about the team when they're winning the league. No bloody sense of loyalty. Unlike you, Ron, you're a shining example of a /real/ Quidditch fan!"

"Harry what are yo-HEEEYYY!" Harry gripped Ron's robes and cleanly tore them off with one firm yank, leaving his friend standing in nothing but his Chudley Cannons boxers. Ron yelped and tried to cover himself with his hands.

"Wh-wh-why did you do that?!" Harry gave a proud smile and clapped the trembling Ron on the back.

"See? Some actual sense of /caring/ about your team. Good on you mate, I mean it!"

Hermione discreetly wiped away some drool at the corner of her mouth before looking Harry in the eyes as Ron slowly inched out of the room with a mortified expression.

"Harry, I do think you need to take a bit of a, y'know backstep in regards to Quidditch for a while. There's a bit of a war going on if you hadn't noticed." Harry gave her a withering glare.

"How 'bout I stop bloody breathing?" He mounted his broom and fell out the window. It had not been open and he got a face full of glass. Not that he cared. It was time for Quidditch. And that all was mattered.
