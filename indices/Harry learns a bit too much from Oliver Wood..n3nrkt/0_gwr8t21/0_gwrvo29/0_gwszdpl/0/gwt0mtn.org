Just Gryffindor? I have the impression the Slytherins are just as mad about it. Real school unity is every team member hunting it down. Plus it's funny to imagine Malfoy and Flint being really annoyed about no Quidditch. (Flint out of love for the game, Malfoy because how else will he prove he's better than /Potter/)

It becomes a yearly tradition to deal with Potter shenanigans early so it doesn't ruin quidditch season.
