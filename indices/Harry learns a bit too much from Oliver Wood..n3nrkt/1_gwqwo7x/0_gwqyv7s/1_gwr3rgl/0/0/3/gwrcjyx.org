My understanding is that, while putting protectives enchantments is common sense when making an Horcrux, they are technically not needed in the creation of one. You could make an Horcrux from a simple diary, or an unenchanted rock. It's stupid but you can do it.

Because of that, Harry was an Horcrux. An accidental one (something that should not be possible, but neither is splitting your soul in 8). An unprotected one but an Horcruxe all the same, which is why Dumbledore was forced to make a way too longue plan just to give him a chance to survive.
