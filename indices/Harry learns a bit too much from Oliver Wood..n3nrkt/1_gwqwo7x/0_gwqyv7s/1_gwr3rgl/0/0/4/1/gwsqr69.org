1. Bill was ridiculously talented/genius ... he got ridiculous amount of NEWTs/OWLs and he was hired by Gringotts, which is even canonically one of the most difficult careers in the wizarding world

2. Dumbledore was professor of Transfiguration / Alchemy (I am not sure whether the latter one is not a fanon), not a specialist on the dark magic (and neither was he specialist on the Divination, by the way; and yes, I ignore FBaWtFT2). Yes, he was ridiculously old, so he probably read a lot of other literature, but I don't think he was the biggest specialist in every area of magic without any competition from people who actually specialized in the particular field.

3. Dealing with horcruxes is the most advanced DADA possible, because they are the most obscure magic (that's canon, I believe), so it makes sense he should consult as many people as he can. Yes, Snape might be too close to Tom, so he should be kept in secret, but there is no such limitation on Bill.
