  Bill was ridiculously talented/genius ... he got ridiculous amount of NEWTs/OWLs and he was hired by Gringotts, which is even canonically one of the most difficult careers in the wizarding world

It's not thats not talented, it's that it's the equivalent of someone getting a 4.0 GPA and going to Med school being asked for help by Einstein on the theory of relativity. Sure, he's smart, but he's not the once-in-a-generation genius that Dumbledore is. I'd say Bill is comparable to Hermione.

Dumbledore, meanwhile, is acknowledged as one of if not the best wizards in the world. He did magic thought impossible as a teenager, invented a variety of things, and generally was incomparable to anyone in his age except Grindelwald and Voldemort.

  so it makes sense he should consult as many people as he can

It was priority number two for Dumbledore to not let the secret of Horcrux spill (priority 1 being to destroy them), in case Voldy figured out he was on to him. Snape is literally the only person it made sense to speak to it about, since he trusted him absolutely.
