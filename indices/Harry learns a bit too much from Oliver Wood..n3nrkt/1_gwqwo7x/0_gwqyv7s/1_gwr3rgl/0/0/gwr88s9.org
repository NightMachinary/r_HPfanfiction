By the way, there is one related thought: I agree with you generally, but the sentence “they have to make the enchantments on them” seems to indicate that /first/ you make a Horcrux, and /then/ you add some kind of protective enchantments on it. So, what happens when you are interrupted in the middle of the process? Say, by being killed by the rebounding Killing Curse? Could it mean, that actually the Horcrux in Harry's head was not completely made, and it could be removed even without destroying the vessel? And why the hell Dumbledore never consulted one professional curse breaker whom he had in the Order of Phoenix with the experience with the darkest curses from the Ancient Egypt (my headcanon is that Herpo the Foul was not a Greek from Greece, but the Greek-speaking Egyptian from the Ptolemaic Egypt)? Why didn't Harry or his brother Ron?
