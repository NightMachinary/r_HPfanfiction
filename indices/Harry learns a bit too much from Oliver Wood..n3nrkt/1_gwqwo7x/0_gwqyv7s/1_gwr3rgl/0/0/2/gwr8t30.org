  Could it mean, that actually the Horcrux in Harry's head was not completely made, and it could be removed even without destroying the vessel?

This has always been my assumption, but we have very little to go on from canon.

As for your Egyptian Herpo theory, it's certainly plausible, but has nothing to back it up. More importantly though, why would it matter? Bill Weasley's experience is with Ancient Egyptian dark magic. Herpo would have lived closer to manned spaceflight than Ancient Egypt.
