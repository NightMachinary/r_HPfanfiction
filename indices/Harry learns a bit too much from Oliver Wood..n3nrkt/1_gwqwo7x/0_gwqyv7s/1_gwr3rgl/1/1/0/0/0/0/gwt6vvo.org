I was just trying to explain what [[/u/howAboutNextWeek][u/howAboutNextWeek]] probably meant. Their theory is that horcrux itself does not make the object indestructible, it has to be spelled further to do that. And since brooms are already full of spells to make them fly, they can't probably be spelled more to make them indestructible - otherwise broom companies would offer that to their customers already.

Edit: changed pronoun to be gender neutral.
