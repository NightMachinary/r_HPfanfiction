Well, it depends on your definition of smut. For me it is any scene, which doesn't bring anything to the overall story and its sole purpose is to titillate sexual feelings of the reader. So, the start of the chapter 7 qualifies in my opinion. And yes, I understand that for the connoisseur of this type of stuff, this is so weak, that it doesn't even register.
