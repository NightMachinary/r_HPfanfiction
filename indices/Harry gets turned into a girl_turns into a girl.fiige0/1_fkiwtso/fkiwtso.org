I've recently started reading What's in a Name? Or a Face? by Over.Thinking.Daily.Life. The story is a nice fluffy read so far. The premise is that the polyjuice plan in CoS goes wrong and Harry gets turned into someone that could be Theodore Nott's twin sister so Snape has him masquerade as Theo's long lost sister. There's no angst so far and real pairing yet.
