I have a theory why Arthur and Molly had so many children: they desperately wanted a girl, so they kept going until they finally had one.

On the other hand, if they had a girl earlier, they would stop having more children, and they would most likely name that girl 'Ginevra'.

In the AU you requested, the Weasleys would have 5 children, with one twin girl named Ginny. Ron and Book Ginny would not exist. Would the new Ginny still worship the Boy-Who-Lived? Or would the new twins still have similar characters as the Book twins?

Honestly, I've never found anything like that before, so fics covering that theme will be highly interesting.
