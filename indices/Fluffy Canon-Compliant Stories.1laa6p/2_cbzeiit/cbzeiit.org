That author has about 20 stories about the Trio after the war. They are all canon-compliant, but with small errors (like the random info JKR releases every now and then...like Percy marrying a girl named Audrey not Penelope, for example). Harry and Ginny's relationship is very real and lovely. They love, fight, have moments where it looks like it will end, and then get back together. Enjoy.
