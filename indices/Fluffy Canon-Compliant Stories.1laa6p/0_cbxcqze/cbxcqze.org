These aren't incredibly long, but here are two from one of my favorite FF authors, Moonprincess92. (She also does a lot of cute oneshots, and has two long Rose/Scorpius stories, if you're at all interested in that. And a post-battle, slightly AU story that focuses on the Weasley siblings and Harry & Hermione) Hope this helps!
