I'm pairing Marlene with Caradoc Dearborn for a fanfic universe I'm thinking up. I see her as kind of a proto-Ginny in that she's a redhead,and a proto-Hermione in that she's /really/ brainy. She's friends with all four Marauders,and briefly went out with Sirius.

I've also written out a headcanon for Alicia Spinnet (who ends up with Fred in this timeline). I see her as the brainiest of the Chaser Trio (w/Angelina being the really athletic one and Katie being the fun,outgoing one). She comes from a halfblood family mostly famous for a Hufflepuff who taught Arithmancy at Hogwarts for /60 years/ (1740-1800).

In both timelines I'm working on, Tracey is a blithe-spirit type of person. She comes from a pureblood family that's not really racist (in fact,if any Davis openly expresses an anti-Muggle/Muggleborn opinion they're automatically disowned). She ends up with Kevin Entwhistle.

Susan and Ernie always end up together in my works,because I loved them in DAYD.
