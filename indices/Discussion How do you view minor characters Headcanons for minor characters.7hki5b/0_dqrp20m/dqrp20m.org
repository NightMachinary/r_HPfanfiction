Ever since reading linkffn(Whatever Happened to Bromance?) I can't view McLaggen as anything other than a frat-bro.

As Daphne Greengrass doesn't have a single line of dialogue in canon, I like to think think of her as one of those people who are quiet and reserved in public, but open, lively, sarcastic, etc. when in private with their best friend (in this case, Tracey Davis).

For some reason, I always view Tracey Davis and Astoria Greengrass as bubbly people with lively personalities. Can't help it.

I view Narcissa Malfoy as someone who doesn't really give a shit about Voldemort or his movement. Only her family. If she has to kill an innocent to save her husband or son, she'll do it, but that's it. She gives a shit about Lucius, Draco, and living a comfortable lifestyle.

Susan Bones has big breasts.
