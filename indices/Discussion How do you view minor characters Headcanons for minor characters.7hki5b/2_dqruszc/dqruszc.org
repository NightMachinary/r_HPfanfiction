As someone who went to high school in a predominantly modern jewish neighborhood (Upper West Side, NYC), every time I think of Anthony Goldstein I think of this friend I had (who actually looks a lot like how Anthony is supposed to look). Basically a super liberal-thinking, very into Jewish culture and events (attends Hebrew school, a lot of his friends are Jewish), metrosexual by the time he was 13/14, ballet-dancing/theater kid, knack in politics and debate.

Marlene McKinnon is super Scottish with the accent to match, even uses words like bairn etc. Comes from a family of aurors. I always remember how they went after her entire family, and I don't see why they'd do that unless all of them were actively opposed to Voldemort in some way. They could also be politicians, but I always kind of reserved that for the Bones family.

Emmeline Vance was a BAMF. This is 100%, there is no way she was such a key member to the Order of the Phoenix if she wasn't. I always thought she was a handful of years older than Harry's parents, but still played with James on the Gryffindor team. Definitely a Chaser, could see her being super fast and aggressive. Has a sort of pub-personality (Idk if that's a thing) but basically after a game would like to crack a cold one with the team (not into huge parties). I always had her as a POC in my head, but in the movie she was depicted as white (this is probably because I associate last name Vance with actor Courtney B Vance, who is Black)
