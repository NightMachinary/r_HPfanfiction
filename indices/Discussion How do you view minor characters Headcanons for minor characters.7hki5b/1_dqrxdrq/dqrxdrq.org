I view Tracey Davis as someone who has a more deadpanned delivery when she speaks, to the point where you aren't too sure if she's joking or serious.

While Daphne is more sarcastic, unafraid of saying what she thinks, although when she's around adults she's perfectly polite and quiet.

Astoria I see as more quiet/reserved, but once she gets to know you she's more open and carefree.

Blaise I see as charming and sophisticated, someone who likes to be around a group of people.

Theodore Nott on the other hand is quiet but can be rather snarky at times; and doesn't say much, but when he feels comfortable can be rather deep about things.

Anthony I see as hardworking, someone that doesn't like the idea of giving up. He's a jokester, but not in the prank making sense, more in the making everyone feel happy sort of sense, being able to draw someone out of their shell.

Padma is the opposite of Parvati. While Parvati is lively, and talkative Padma is quiet, and can be pretty shy if she's not around that person a whole lot.

Susan is charming and very nice to people, she'll talk about things she likes while trying to get someone to talk to her. She's helpful, always wanting to help students who are having trouble.

Hannah is incredibly shy, just as shy as Neville is. She stammers when she speaks, which she does grow out of. She's not very talkative but she means well.

Marlene much like Susan is incredibly nice person, she in my headcanon had a huge crush on Sirius Black. She was friends with Lily Evans, and in my headcanon became a Healer at St. Mungos.

Emmeline is very outgoing, loving to party and have fun, but she will at times want to be by herself without others every now and then. I often see her older then James and Lily, likely around Molly and Arthur's age or even Fabian and Gideon's age. (I have Fabian and Gideon as older brothers to Molly, I know some people have them as younger).

I often have Emmeline and Fabian together as a couple before the war.

Narcissa loves her family and would do anything for them. In my headcanon Rodolphus Lestrange had a crush on Narcissa, but her family ended up doing an arranged marriage with Lucius Malfoy; who she does love in her own quiet way. But it's her son that she loves and would do anything for.
