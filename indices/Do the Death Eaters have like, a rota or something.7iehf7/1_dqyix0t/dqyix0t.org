I imagine it's pieced together much like how most terrorist networks are. There's the supreme head/center of propaganda, but then everything from there is heavily decentralized. That way there's a common goal/thing they're working towards, but the actual hands on day-to-day is very much left up to individual 'cells' if you would. Even at that level, there's always a disconnect between those who are the true believers to the cause, and those who are associates, or useful idiots.

This is why I believe it was such a big deal in the books to be a /marked/ Death Eater and not merely someone that was assisting them (either willingly or unwillingly). A Death Eater was someone that was fully committed to the cause, a "made man" if you will. They're /part/ of the organization, the ones who actively work to bring about their cause. As opposed to those who were merely recruited to assist. They weren't loyal to the Death Eaters, but they were willing to help.

To give an example, not everyone that works for ISIL actually is a card carrying member of them. Some just work with them because their ideals line up. This is similar to how Umbridge wasn't a Death Eater, but she certainly had zero qualms in assisting with their campaigns.
