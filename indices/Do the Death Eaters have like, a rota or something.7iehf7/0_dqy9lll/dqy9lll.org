I imagine them having a loose organisation where you spend your free time murdering unless you have specific instructions from Voldemort. So a few "gentlemen" meet up, have a few drinks and go out for a night of murderous fun. Voldemort strikes me as the type who despises micromanagement unless it involves his obscure plans. He is content with his followers doing their own thing as long as it serves his cause.

Of course there are coordinated actions as well as Voldemort's master plan but for the most part, direct supervision of rape, murder, torture and arson is not required. One of the inner circle as oversight should be enough.
