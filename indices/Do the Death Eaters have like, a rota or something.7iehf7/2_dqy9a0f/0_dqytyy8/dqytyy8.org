  who get tasked with stuff like torturing the Longbottoms

Might just be fanon, but I was under the impression that the torture of the Longbottoms was not done on any sort of orders from Voldemort, since he had already been defeated by the time the torture occurred. Instead it was a group of his followers torturing members of the Order for information as to their lord's status/location.
