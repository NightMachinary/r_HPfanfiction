I got the impression that Voldemort planned most things for the evening, so any employed Death Eaters would have been off work at that point. Most official meetings or attacks are probably scheduled well beforehand, so everyone has time to make their excuses.

For unplanned summonings, we see during Voldemort's initial return that Snape doesn't show up in the graveyard and is later forgiven for this. It never comes up again or hangs suspiciously over his head.

Presumably, this is because he was publicly being a professor at Hogwarts at the time, which seems to have been taken as a perfectly valid excuse. He couldn't very well disappear from the stands at the Triwizard Tournament without looking suspicious af.

Voldemort is aware of which of his followers have day jobs, especially ones where they can't necessarily just skip out suddenly, like Snape or McNair. So they probably get a good amount of slack if they can't always make it on short notice, whereas outlaws like Bellatrix are likely expected to be available 24/7. People like Malfoy, who may or may not be in the middle of a political meeting at the time of an unexpected summons, might be given some slack on a more case-by-case basis.
