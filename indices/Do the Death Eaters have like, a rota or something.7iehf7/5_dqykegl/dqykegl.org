I've always viewed the group to be composed of lots of competing individuals and factions, all trying to accumulate the favour of Voldermort, plus personal power and influence. If anyone is familiar with the current historiographical orthodoxy that the Nazi government (and state institutions) was comprised of officials and departments constantly competing against each other and not actually working very effectively together, then that's probably the best way I can describe my conceptualisation of how the Death Eater structure operated.
