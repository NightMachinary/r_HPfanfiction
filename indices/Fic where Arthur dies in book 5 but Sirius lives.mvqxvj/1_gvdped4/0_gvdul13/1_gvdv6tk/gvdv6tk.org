I found her to be a motherly figure when it was convenient. She overly mothered some of her children and over indulged others. She acted as if she always knew best even when she didn't.

It's no surprise the oldest five turned out the way they did:

Bill and Charlie chose jobs that took them far away, and bill then married a French woman.

Percy wanted to be the opposite of his family due to the isolation and socio-emotional neglect that he experienced similarly to Ron. Percy emulated Bills success to stand out as only his achievements seemed to be recognized, not Percy himself appeared to be valued.

The twins were pranksters that often bordered on bullies. The loss of her brothers likely impacting her letting them run wild to a degree.

Ron and Ginny were overly coddled in my opinion.

As a child I was always wary of her, particularly how she treated Sirius in his own house. She was always so quick to put Sirius down, not realizing how much trauma he suffered in Azkaban as well as how being back in his childhood home also come cause him to regress.

She always seemed so quick to say he saw Harry as James but I always felt like Molly tried to replace Lily in Harry's life without being asked and Harry had too much childhood abuse/trauma to correct her. Whether this was intentional or not it's odd to me she noticed he was too skinny but none of the signs of neglect.
