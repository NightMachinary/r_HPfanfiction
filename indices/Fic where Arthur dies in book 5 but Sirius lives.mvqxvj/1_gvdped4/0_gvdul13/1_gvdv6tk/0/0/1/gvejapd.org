his inferiority complex isn't because of his mother, but because of how many siblings he has. And, I'm sure many of his brothers felt the same. Ron felt like the least loved Weasley boy, but that wasn't true at all. None of them were coddled. And, if you had 6 sons, wouldn't you want a daughter as well? I don't think they kept on trying for a girl, I think most of them were genuinely mistakes. Also, while she didn't treat Fleur well, she treated her bad because she didn't think Fleur actually loved Bill. After Bill's face got marred and Fleur still wanted to marry him, she treated her better. That was her being overprotective mama bear. Why would she treat Harry like a Lily replacement when she wasn't even close to Lily? And, Grimmauld Place was a MESS, it needed to be cleaned up. Molly was like a mother to Harry, but Sirius had only just met him. Sirius did treat him like a James clone. She was invested in Harry's actions because he didn't have parents who could be. Maybe she wasn't the world's greatest mom, but she cared and loved them all and she always did the best she could. She had good intentions for sure.
