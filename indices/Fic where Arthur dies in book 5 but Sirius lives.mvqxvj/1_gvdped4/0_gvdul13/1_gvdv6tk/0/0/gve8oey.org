I'm not saying she was a bad mother but I ALWAYS SAW it as she created a lot of pressure on each of her children to be successful which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I expressed why I saw Molly as insufferable and we can agree to disagree.

However her intolerance of things not fitting into her mold was off putting TO ME as a child and as an adult as someone who was never good enough for failing to meet stereotypes and generalizations.

If you like her that's great for you, but she never came off as particularly likable to me and thus my comment about finding her quite insufferable. Her treatment of Sirius is why I would have rather had Sirius survive. While I didn't mind Arthur I never quite took to the Weasleys. I saw them as a family who seemed too invested in Harry's actions considering how little time they spent together relatively speaking.

To me, Percy was embarrassed by Arthur yes but he also seemed embarrassed by the whole lifestyle of his family that was much larger than it likely should have been. Yes the family loved themselves but I felt it irresponsible to keep having kids if they were struggling. I know it's not canon but it almost felt like she only wanted a daughter. She had favorites, Bill and Ginny. Bill's nature and exploits made Molly very fond of her eldest, and Ginny was the girl so awaited by the Weasleys for more than a century.

Percy is not looked at in a particularly flattering light by his family. All of Percy's siblings were either mocking (the younger) or condescending (the older) towards him. Molly didn't know or possibly didn't care to support to two isolated sons in Percy and Ron.

Percy acted accordingly, trying to Emulate the success that made Bill a clear favorite to Molly. Molly rewarded Percy for all he achieved not in Percy himself but his scholastic achievements themselves.

Ron seems coddled TO ME in the sense that he never seemed to have a concern about the real world. He grew up thinking he would be the best friend like Ginny would be the wife. His concerns were essentially the cannons and his next meal. He couldn't really be bothered to do his schoolwork or chores. Granted that is how a lot of teens are, but I honestly feel like his inferiority complex was in part due to Molly.

The French comment is based on the England- France rivalry. Bill did what he could to rebel his mother's expectations whether intentional or not: long hair, earring, and marrying a French woman instead of a “respectable British witch”

I lost a lot of respect for her after her initial treatment of Fleur as well as learning she potentially love potioned Arthur. I don't see how telling others she once brewed love potion could be a good thing when Ginny at that point seemed to have a crush on the boy who lived persona instead of her brothers friend.

Her children were successful in different ways because of how she tried to micromanage many of them. Being successful academically for example was a one way ticket for the oldest two at least in my opinion.
