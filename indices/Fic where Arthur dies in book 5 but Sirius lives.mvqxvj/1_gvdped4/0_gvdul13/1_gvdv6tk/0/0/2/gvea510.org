Her love potioning Arthur is not canon. He also had no clue Harry liked Ginny until 6th when Harry kissed her, and even then his reaction was essentially â€˜well, if you must'. I don't see how he was somehow plotting to have Harry married to Ginny the entire time he knew him. And really? His only concerns are the Cannons and food?
