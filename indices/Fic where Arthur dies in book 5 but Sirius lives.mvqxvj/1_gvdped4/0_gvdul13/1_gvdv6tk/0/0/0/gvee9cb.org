When I read the books I got a feeling that Molly never particularly gave Ron much attention. There was always someone doing better, creating a bigger mess or seeming more vulnerable that unless he did something dramatic (steal a car) he was basically left alone.

The fact that Molly went through the barrier before Ron I think says a lot. And that We see she shows Harry so much more love and attention than we ever see her show Ron.

I agree with you on basically all the other points, an incredibly overbearing mother would drive away kids as we.see happen.
