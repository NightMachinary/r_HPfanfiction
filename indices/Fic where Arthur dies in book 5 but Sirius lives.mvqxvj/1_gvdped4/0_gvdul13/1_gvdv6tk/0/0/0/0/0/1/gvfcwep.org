Speaking as a dumpy housewife, I freaking love that she beats Bellatrix. ;-)

Molly is seen through Harry's eyes, who knows what she did and what skills she has besides those centred on her home and family? My own children were very surprised when they first saw me on stage- they had no idea I was an actor before they were born, yet acting took up a great deal of my pre-kid life.

Molly beating Bellatrix demonstrates some of the major themes of the novels- that heroes come from all walks of life, even ones that are often devalued,(See: Dobby) that people are complex and can surprise you for good or bad (Sirius, Pettigrew) and that the 2 dimensional stereotypes we come up with as kids are rarely a perfect fit. (Neville is underestimated, Snape is not just the "bully teacher", Dudley is capable of growth, Dumbledore is not just a light-hearted, twinkly eyed eccentric, and Molly has skills other than those of a housewife)
