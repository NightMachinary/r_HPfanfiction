Maybe coddle was the wrong phrasing... but it felt that way in comparison to Percy. I can't think of the parenting style but I know it's not authoritarian or authoritative... it just came across confusing where basic needs are met but the emotional ones arent

Her black and white thinking annoyed me especially with why the twins and Ron had to rescue Harry as well. She was far from the worst parent in the potter universe but I never understood the hype except for her battle With Bellatrix.

The whole barrier thing was always fishy to me. I never even thought about her going in before Ron. For someone who had five students before Ron it was odd to me how Harry learned to get to the platform from Molly. In CoS I found it odd how Ron and Harry had to go last.
