Yeah, after Percy pushed away from the family and without charlie and bill she focused her attention on the only children she could. That happened to be Ron and ginny

But her battle with Bellatrix felt so wrong. She is portrayed as this dumpy housewife and she absolutely destroys one of Voldy's top duelists.

Not that any character in the books actually seems like they have ever practiced dueling in their life. Children should not beat death eaters, it should have been a slaughter.
