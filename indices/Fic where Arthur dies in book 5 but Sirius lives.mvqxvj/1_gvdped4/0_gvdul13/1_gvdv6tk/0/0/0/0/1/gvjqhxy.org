A lot of that Weasley stuff is because Rowling bends the characters to develop the plot. Molly was talking about the platform because Rowling wanted the entrance to be weird, to introduce this family to Harry. If Molly's behaviour went against worldbuilding or character then it doesn't matter cause plot comes first.

Second year, she is mad about the flying car so that they get in trouble when they take it and can be told to go to an adult first (Lockhart). She goes through before the boys because the plot says so, not because she is neglectful.

Rita's articles needed to have a visible impact rather than just telling us students distrust Harry again. Molly dislikes Fleur so we can get a double love confession in the hospital wing. She jokes about love portioning Arthur cause Rowling wasn't concerned about consent for men.

I choose to think the best of all characters so I prefer to read from Au's that get rid of these counteractive flaws.

Rowling put a lot of depth into her characters, Molly, Remus and Sirius have flaws that work for a kids story, but as I'm older I want to see them learn and grow. (Like, wow Remus had a good character moment in the hospital wing as he learns to accept the love from Tonks, but two months later he's running away again.)
