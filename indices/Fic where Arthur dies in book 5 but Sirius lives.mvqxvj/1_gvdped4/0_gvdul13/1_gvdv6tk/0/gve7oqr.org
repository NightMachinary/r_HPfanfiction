I don't disagree that Molly was often overbearing, but uhh...

Percy was embarrassed by his father's lack of ambition. He, however, recieved new robes and an owl for his achievements.

Ron wasn't coddled at all. In fact, JKR went out of her way to write his parents' treatment of him almost opposite of Ginny, Bill, Percy, and Harry.

And there's really nothing wrong with the way her children turned out.

Bill was a top student, head boy, prefect, and was, apparently, successful in his career.

Charlie was apparently successful as well.

Percy had top marks, was HB/prefect, and fell assbackwards into a good career positions.

The twins were successful business men and talented wizards.

Ginny and Ron both had successful careers.

And what's wrong with marrying a French woman?
