Various quality. The one with an old English title is slash (more sweet than explicit). One is founder's era Dramione (the Latin title), the rest are about Harry.

A fifth option is Of a Linear Circle, which, in Part 3 is Harry in the founder's era. It's like, 250k words into the story, however, and most of it is slash... well, the founder's era part isn't really and the romance isn't the focus of the story, but it's still there. [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/755028][The series is here.]]. I suppose you could /technically/ read part 3 first and be fine, though there'd be some spoilers when/if you go back to part one/two. And if you want to read more, you have to go back and read part one/two.

EDIT - looking at it again, I have the Darth Marrs one labeled wrong in my library. Not time travel, and not very good either.
