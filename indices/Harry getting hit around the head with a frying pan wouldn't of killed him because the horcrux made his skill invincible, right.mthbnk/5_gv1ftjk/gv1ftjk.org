Being an Horcruxe does not bring any special protection to an item (or in the case of Harry and Nagini, a living being). It's because the Dark Wizard enchanted the items before hand (to make them suitable receptacles) that they are resilient.

So no, Harry doesn't have a "invincible skull", but it doesn't mean he would have died from this because :

- It's not like Petunia tried to swing at full power. She just tried to give him a "little" hit with the thing she had in her hand (so a frying pan). I mean, as a child I got hit by a broom once or twice because my mother had her hand full, it's pretty much the same thing. A bump at worst (also, I can't help to think that she would not have tried after one hit if she truly went for the kill).
- In HBP, Harry get hit in the head by a metal ball flying at high speed, probably followed by a pretty big fall (since he was flying), and he is good to go after one night in the Infirmary. If he could get out of that without any lasting injury, I doubt Petunia could physicaly kill him even if she wanted to.
