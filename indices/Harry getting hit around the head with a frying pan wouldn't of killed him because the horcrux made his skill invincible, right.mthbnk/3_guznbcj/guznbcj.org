Hmm, it might do something, horcruxes seem more durable than they ought to be... That could just be charms Voldemort put on them after the fact though. Harry gets small injuries so I don't expect he has any magical protection of that sort. Could be the sort that only kicks in when lethal injury occurs though.

The prophecy might do some spooky action at a distance to prevent non-Voldemorts from killing Harry. Something like helping Harry know when to duck.

I really can't get my head around how prophecy is supposed to work in the HP verse. Are there magic gods looking into the future and using seers as sock puppets to tell people things sometimes? Are they taking action to make them come true? Why would one event deserve a prophecy but not another?

The simplest interpretation is that Harry would just die if he were hit hard with something heavy.
