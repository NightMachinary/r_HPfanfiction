I've been hijacking a few posts like yours because I've been hoping someone will help me find one fic I read once on this topic. At the end of the war Harry is really worshipped as the hero he is but since people are really outraged at all the people who were close to Death Eaters, even if they had no part in the war (such as Andromeda or the Greengrass sisters), Harry advocates for forgiveness and peace in order to protect Teddy. One of the main themes of the story is how fickle the public admiration is, since after Harry holds his speech, everyone starts hating him. I cannot remember either where I read the story or what it was called, but it was really well written and covered several themes that you would not usually find in a JK written book such as PTSD, the post-war chaos after an entire government is removed, the downsides of celebrity, forgiveness and friendship. Also the Death Eater trials are done in a very realistic way.
