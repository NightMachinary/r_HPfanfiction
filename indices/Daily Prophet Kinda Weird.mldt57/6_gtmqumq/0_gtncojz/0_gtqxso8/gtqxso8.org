Every January, there's a march on Washington DC, where pro-life Americans peacefully protest. It's called the March for Life.

It's a very large protest, but given that it's peaceful, it's not usually covered in the media.

In 2019, a group of white students from Covington Catholic High School, who had attended the March, were being harassed by a group of Black Hebrew Israelites (an extremely fringe group) while they waited for their bus. A man from another group for Native Americans approached the boys, while beating his drum.

Videos shot at such angles that did not show the Black Hebrew Israelites led to the impression that the white students were harassing the Native American man.

The mainstream media took the videos and ran with them and ran /dozens/ of stories smearing the reputations of the students. Nationwide. For days.

Even after full videos from security cameras were leaked, showing what really happened, very few admitted they were at fault.
