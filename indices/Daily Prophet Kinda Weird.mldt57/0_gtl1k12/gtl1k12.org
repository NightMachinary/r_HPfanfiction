First of all, the population of magical Britain is apparently pretty small, so the Daily Prophet is more like your town's local paper than a national paper. And it's not uncommon for local papers to report on things that happen in the local schools, though they almost always stick to covering events and the accomplishments of students, not teenage drama.

/However/, you are forgetting the actual circumstances of Rita's reporting. Harry was already a major celebrity and he was participating in a major international competition. Of course the press is going to be all over that, even before you add in the fact that he was entered under suspicious circumstances and the fact that another competitor is also an international celebrity.

This isn't the New York Times reporting on the daily lives of NYU students. This is your local paper reporting on a world-renowned child actor, who happens to live in your hometown, competing in the Olympics against the most famous athlete in the world. Oh, and there appears to be a love triangle tossed in for good measure.

Now I will say that reporting on the supposed love triangle probably is going a step too far, but it's not entirely unexpected, and Hermione really should have known what she was getting into by very publicly going on a date with a celebrity. And other than that, I don't think that Rita did report much on the daily lives of students. I could be forgetting some articles though.

--------------

Now to look at it from a completely different direction, making Rita a student reporting for the school newspaper also doesn't work as well from a narrative perspective.

The first three books are just school stories that are almost entirely insulated from the wider world. In GoF, the narrative pushes Harry to deal with the world outside of Hogwarts, and Rita is a major part of that, culminating in Harry being both symbolically and literally ripped out of Hogwarts to face Voldemort. And then in OotP, Umbridge brings the outside world into Hogwarts and Harry is forced to deal with it. In HBP, Hogwarts is mostly insulated again, but the external pressures are a lot more overt, and again symbolically and literally invade Hogwarts in the climax. And in DH, almost the entire story takes place out in the world.

Someone could probably write an entire thesis around this idea, but I think I've said enough to make my point. And without Rita in the middle, the progression falls apart.

Also, if she's just a teenager, then her actions are a lot more excusable. And adult spying on kids is a lot worse than a teenager spying on other teenagers, so her comeuppance at the end feels deserved.
