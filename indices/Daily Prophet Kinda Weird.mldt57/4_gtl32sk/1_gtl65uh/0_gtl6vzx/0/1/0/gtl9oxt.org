Do you want short answer or long answer? The first (completed) part of the series follows Draco after the Death Eater Trials then Scorpius through a substantially altered version of Cursed Child. The second (active) part is about the rise of anti-muggle and anti-magic groups in the U.S. with a big focus on the idea of dark wizards viewing muggles as a resource rather than just indiscriminately hunting them for sport like the Death Eaters did.
