I agree... I feel like it could have been anyone to find them Lily was just the first person to pop into my brain.... I can imagine pretty much the same senario happening with perfessor McGonnagal or Flittwik (who I imagine would be really excited about the concept of a newspaper) /shrugs/... but like I said I agree, I don't like how in so many fanfictions Harry cowers and hides when Ginny (who is his wife or girlfriend) is mad.... Like you, Harry, Defeated a /DARK LORD.../ are you really scared of ginny weasley? Nothing against Ginny, Love her, but really?

Edit: I forgot the point of me writing that - I feel them just needing to make a lie so people don't find out about the map.
