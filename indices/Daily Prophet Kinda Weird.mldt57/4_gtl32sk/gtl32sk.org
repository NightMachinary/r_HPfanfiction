I just want to comment about the school paper, because I can totally see the marauders doing this...

...The marauders map...

"The marauders map? whats that?" Lily asked the four pranksters who were gatherd around a parchment.

"Map? What Map?" Peter asks looking nevously from Lily to the other Marauders.

"thats what I'm asking you" Lily looked between the four "Well?"

"Its a- umm" "A NEWSPAPER Idea we had" Sirius said quickly "yes a newspaper" nodding.\\
Remus leans into wisper in his ear "a /newspaper, REALLY?" "/It was the first thing I thought of"

Lily raises an eyebrow "a newspaper?"

James nodding "yes a newspaper, we thought we could, you know, keep people updated in the school, and stuff"

"and you want to call it the Marauders Map?" Lily asked

They all nodded, "Its an Aliteration, moony came up with the name" Sirius said.

"Yes" remus said "yes I did. I thought it was... Fun"

"WELL, we don't have timne for this, have work to do, on the... Marauders...Map, yup the Map. BYE" JAmes said pushing the rest of the group away from the redhead. "A Newspaper!? Padfoot? Really?"

"HEY, it wasn't that bad" Sirius defended.

Peters quiet voice broke through the small wispershout match "Shes going to expect a newspaper at some point quys, by now I bet have the school now about this Map/Newspaper Idea..."

Remus looked at peter "well shit... Sirius you'd better start working"

"WHAT, Why Me?"

"It was your /brilliant idea/"

Thats all I got, I'm not a great writer but I thought it could be fun.
