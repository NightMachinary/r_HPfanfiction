Sorry to hear that. There are a lot of stories with a similar name its possible someone posted it on another site pretending it was their own story, this happens sometimes when a story is good. Could you leave a description of some sort to help people find the correct one if they come across it.

I would also suggest that the fics you are enjoying the most you save yourself. There are many reasons a fic can be taken down, some because of the author others because of the site but it happens all the time. Its happened to me before so I try to download the long stories that might take me a while to read.

I personally use [[http://www.ff2ebook.com/index.php][ff2ebook]], I hope this will be of use to you in the future.
