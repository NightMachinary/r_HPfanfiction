All of my friends are massive nerds. I'm a massive nerd. I'm the only person in our house who isn't a part of our University's LARP club. One of my best friends is deeply involved in an online Star Trek RP - and this is the one who's actually a productive member of society (having just graduated and got a job). We have twice weekly sessions of Dungeons and Dragons (Pathfinder, technically, but what's the difference), in which the one character who isn't drawing from the [[http://www.minmaxboards.com/index.php?board=101.0][Touhou Battle Grimoire]] is playing a slightly toned down version of Shiki Tohno. I got my first "real" job in part because the guy who would be my boss was ALSO a massive nerd, and our interview sidetracked into a conversation over Kirk v. Picard

So no.

I get a few chuckles from one of my friends when I explain to her what I'm writing/have written when she asks about it, but that's the worst of it.
