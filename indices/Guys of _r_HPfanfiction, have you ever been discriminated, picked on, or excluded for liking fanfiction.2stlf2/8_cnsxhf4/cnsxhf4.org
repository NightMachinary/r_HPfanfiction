(One) guy of [[/r/HPFanFiction]] here. I've never been discriminated against, picked on, or excluded for enjoying fanfiction. Then again, I don't exactly go around trumpeting my hobbies in public (whether fanfiction, Civ5, or something else). I'm fairly introverted, and don't enjoy talking about myself, which are bigger reasons why I don't bring these things up in public.

About the only person I've ever actually discussed fanfiction with in person is my sister, and that was maybe once when she told me she likes Snape-Hermione while I like Harry-Daphne or Harry-Tonks.
