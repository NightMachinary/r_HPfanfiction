People tend to ask me what i'm reading on my kindle I Generally answer with the name of the fic minus anything that idifies it as a fanfiction.

ex.

Harry Potter and the Nightmatres of Future Past -> Nightmatres of Future Past\\
Harry Potter and the methods of rationality -> Methods of Rationality

Then if they are interested and ask me what is about i give a short sumary

Ej:

NOFP: A Wizard goes back in time to his younger self after the future is destroyed by his nemesis, and tries to fix the time line while he deals with PTSD.

If they ask me for the file i give it to them, this generaly ends with them either getting into fanficion o simply ignoring it when they realize its fanfiction.
