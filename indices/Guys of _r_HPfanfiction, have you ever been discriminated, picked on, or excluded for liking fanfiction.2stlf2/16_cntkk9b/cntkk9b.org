Yes. I've told people at school that I read it and write it, and they picked on me with dirty jokes that I still don't understand, until I mentioned that I have no idea what that stuff is. They then had me explain what fanfiction was specificly (they thought it was pretty much the written equivalent of porn) and I explained that it was simply alertnet timelines and they left me alone. Pretty much the same thing happpend with tumblr actually.
