I don't think any of my friends actually know about it to be honest. Think one of my flatmates may have seen some up on my kindle once but not sure if he'd really know the difference. I get some gentle ribbing because of my open love of anything Harry Potter related so I'd imagine it would just get lumped into that.

I'd say I'm a fan of Harry Potter, which extends to Harry Potter fanfiction, as opposed to a fan of fanfiction which includes Harry Potter. I'd imagine they'd see the second as weirder, seeing as how everyone's just sort of used to my interest in HP.
