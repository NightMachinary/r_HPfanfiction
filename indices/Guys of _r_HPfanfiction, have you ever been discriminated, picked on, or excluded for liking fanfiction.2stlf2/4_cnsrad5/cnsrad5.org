Most of my friends know that I read this stuff. But we're CG artists and game developers. As such geeky and nerdy stuff surrounds us 24/7. Me liking fanfiction is about average on the geek-o-meter when it comes to my circle of friends. I mean, we have hardcore LARP players and all they have to "suffer through" for doing what they like is that we sometimes adress them with their fantasy names.

Sure, we make fun of each other for each others special little quirks, but its all in good fun.

Also, while writing this it hit me that you might mean people in general, not just people whos opinions about my hobbies are worth a fuck to give. To that: No, can't remember being disciminated, picked on or excluded for liking ff. But this is not a topic I usually speak about with a stranger.
