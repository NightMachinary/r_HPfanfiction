Only told 2 people ever. One of them laughed in my face the first time, but he doesn't make fun of me for it. The other one was a girl who was obsessed with HP when I was in middle school (~12 years ago), so she was actually pretty excited about it. Yes that's right, I've told 2 people in over 12 years of reading HPFF.
