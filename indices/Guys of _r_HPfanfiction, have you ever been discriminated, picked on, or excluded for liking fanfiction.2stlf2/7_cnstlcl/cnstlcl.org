More often than not, i actually find it's an icebreaker. Most of e time people either allready read it, in woch case it starts a spout of recommendations and/or shipping discussions or they have not read it, but if they like one of the fandoms i read fanfiction if, i'll give them a rec before moving on to a different topic.
