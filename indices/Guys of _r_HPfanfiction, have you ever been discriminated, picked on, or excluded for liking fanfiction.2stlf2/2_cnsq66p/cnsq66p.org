Nope. Most of my friends know I write/read fanfic and most of them just think of it as a geeky hobby. A few of them were actually quite interested when I mentioned the numbers of readers and writers -- they had no idea it was so huge.

But in general I think people worry too much about how people perceive it. Actually, people just don't care lol. They're not going around their lives judging you; they're too busy dealing with their own shit to give your hobbies too much thought.
