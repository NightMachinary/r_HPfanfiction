I'm not shy about telling people I read/write fanfic, but I'm /very/ selective about giving people a link to my stuff. I knew my mom would be interested because she loves the HP books and she's read my original fiction novels and liked them.

My dad, on the other hand, cheerfully and honestly thinks fantasy of any kind is silly; doesn't get the point. He's not a dick about it, he just doesn't have the kind of brain that appreciates things that aren't real.

So, yeah, I'll only tell my real-life friends about my specific story when I have a strong hunch they'll be interested in it, and not just because I wrote it.
