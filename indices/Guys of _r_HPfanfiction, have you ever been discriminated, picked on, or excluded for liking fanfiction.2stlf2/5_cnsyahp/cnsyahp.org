It doesn't come up much, but when it does, people mostly seem intrigued. For people who aren't in the loop, it usually blows their mind when I tell them there are 700,000 Harry Potter pieces on FF.net alone.

I've never been picked on or had a negative experience talking about it. I usually bring it up in the context of improving at writing: instant feedback, a community with a lot of knowledge and diverse opinions, stuff like that. Most people are at the very least intrigued; some want to read what I've written. Hell, /my mom/ e-mailed me a couple days ago to bug me about updating my fic. :P
