Most people I know dont know what FanFiction is so there first experience with it is me explaining it to them. The few that know what FanFiction is either read it themselves or just think its erotica. From the latter I feel a large amount of judgment even if its unspoken. At the end of the day I describe it like theres a ton of shit but every now and again you get a great story for free.
