Nah. My friends tease me sometimes, but it's good natured ("Oh, you don't want to go have a drink? Is it fanfiction night?" but even if I shrug and say "yes," they leave it and tell me to pop over if I want).

I mean, I don't tell them that I have a love of kinky Dragon Age fanfiction (most of what I read in that realm is not on ff.net). That's... that's personal.

I think they're under the impression I've only been reading "Snape-is-Harry's-dad" fanfic for the past five years.
