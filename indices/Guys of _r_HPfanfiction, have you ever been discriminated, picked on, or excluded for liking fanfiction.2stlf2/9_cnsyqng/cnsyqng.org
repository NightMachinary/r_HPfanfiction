My family knows and is supportive, as do most of my friends.

My manager at work found out I write fanfic because I don't really try to hide any link between my pen name and my real name, and he thought it was a good idea to bring it up publicly.\\
Got some "funny" comments about it for the past month but they mostly stopped by now because I made it clear I don't care.

It helps that I work in a geek profession I guess, I have colleagues who are absolutely obsessed with things like Farscape or Star Trek.
