Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

No bashing, Dumbledore's a great mentor but not all-powerful in politics, Ron is about as good as Harry and they make a great duo, Hermione's doing as well as she can after getting expelled by Malfoy's plot and homeschooled.

Harry/Hermione romance post-Hogwarts after a bunch of other teenage romances have failed (the first romance usually doesn't last for very long).

Harry and Ron are aurors, Harry's adopted by Sirius, Hermione is Sirius's secretary and helps with his political campaign, and the mysterious Night Nargles terrorize the vaults of rich purebloods who have most of the political power. Who'd guess that it's Sirius and his secretary with a massive grudge against Malfoy and his friends under the mask?

The romance gets quite strained by the fact that Hermione's the one who Harry's supposed to arrest, without him knowing it.
