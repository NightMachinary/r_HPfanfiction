*Short stories:* Linkffn(Gamp's Finest Blend of Pretend; Imagination by Potato19; Baby, it's Cold Outside by Potato19; Of Quidditch Pants and Persuasion; Many Thanks by Madm05)

*Long fics:* Linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat; Me Without My TARDIS; A Step to the Right by CatsAreCool), Vox Corporis.

These are my favorites for Harry/Hermione, with *Vox Corporis* being right at the top.
