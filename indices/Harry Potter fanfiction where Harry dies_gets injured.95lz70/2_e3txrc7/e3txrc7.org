Recnac is one of my favourite series as well! I've probably reread it more than I have any other HP fic. I also love Hero by the same author, which I'm sure you've already read.

Some other angsty and/or hurt Harry-centric fics that I can recall are:

- Harry Potter and the Power of Emotion (and its sequel, which I believe has more angst/hurt?; complete) linkffn(1673267)
- Too Far from Home (in progress) linkffn(5757945)
- Sticks in a Bundle (abandoned?) linkffn(5501419)
- In Care Of (complete) linkffn(4927160)
- Love and Love Again (in progress) linkffn(7624618)

And while not Harry-centric (in fact, he dies as a baby), this one-shot hit all the right emotional/angsty chords for me, if you want to check it out. linkao3(4308630)
