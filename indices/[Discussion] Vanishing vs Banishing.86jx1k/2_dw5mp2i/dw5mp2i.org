No... No, its not justified.

But I get that its a bit of a pet peeve. Not for me, as I just go with the flow of what the author /meant/, as long as its obvious from the context.

But I'm also the one who will degrade any fic to shit-tier in my mind at the simple glance of the words "magical core", so there you go.
