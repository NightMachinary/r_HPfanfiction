  Pure-blood supremacy started out of the genuine recognition that muggle born wizards tended not to be as strong.

I doubt it honestly. Nothing in the series suggests that and there's good evidence it's false. The two strongest wizards of the age are half-bloods. The ability to use magic at all is genetic, but nothing has been mentioned about the power of one's magic having to do with blood "purity".

  Squibs are people with not enough magic genes active. They are aware of magic, but don't have enough of an affinity to wield most wands. (Though would a wand with high conductivity let a squib use magic?)
#+end_quote

No. Squibs cannot use magic period because they didn't inherit the ability. Nothing about any wand can change that, JKR made this clear (although the series did as well) when she said that Filch could never have learned magic through the Kwickspell course.

  People like Dumbledore randomly have more magic genes active, making it more instinctual to actually cast magic, as opposed to those who have to learn it the hard(er) way.
#+end_quote

This is a misunderstanding. The series repeatedly shows that whatever differences in magic power there are, the true determination of Magical power tends to come down to intelligence and knowledge. Never once is it even hinted that some "randomly have more magic genes active", especially since the only genes for magic are those which determine if one can use it or not. Voldemort, Dumbledore, Grindlewald, Hermione (arguably) are supposed to be powerful because of their wide ranging knowledge on magic.
