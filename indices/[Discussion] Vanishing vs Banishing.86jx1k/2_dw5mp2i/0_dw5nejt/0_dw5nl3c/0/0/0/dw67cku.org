There is no mana pool, but some wizards do have higher magical power than others. Dumbledore and Crouch at the very least refer to magical power coming in amounts, in greater or lesser amounts.

But still, that doesn't mean magic is a depletable quantity that the wizard uses up from a "core". I just treat it as something that limits the power, scale and preservation of the magic one casts. At the very least, this power increases as one reaches the age of maturity, as no 4th year (per Crouch) has strong enough magic to use the Killing Curse, but Crabbe could do so at 17.
