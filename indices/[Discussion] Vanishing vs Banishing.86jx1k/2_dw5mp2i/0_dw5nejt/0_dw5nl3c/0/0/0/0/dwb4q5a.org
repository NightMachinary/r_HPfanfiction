Along with that, I've always thought that magic has a genetic component to it. It explains quite a bit, IMO:

Pure-blood supremacy started out of the genuine recognition that muggle born wizards tended not to be as strong.

Squibs are people with not enough magic genes active. They are aware of magic, but don't have enough of an affinity to wield most wands. (Though would a wand with high conductivity let a squib use magic?)

People like Dumbledore randomly have more magic genes active, making it more instinctual to actually cast magic, as opposed to those who have to learn it the hard(er) way.
