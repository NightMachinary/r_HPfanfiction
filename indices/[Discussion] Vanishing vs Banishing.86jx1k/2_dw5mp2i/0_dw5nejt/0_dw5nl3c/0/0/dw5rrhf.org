I think at this point I often can't completely separate the """""good""""", or at least not detrimental uses of magical cores, from the bad or catastrophic ones. Its because they tend to negate a core part of the HP magic system that I always loved.

The only limitations in HP are your own talent, will and knowledge. There is no mana-pool that limits you, no natural power level you're born with and no anime-esque magic power you can train up like a muscle by constant use. Its all mental, all in the mind (and the wrist...). The only exhaustion you can suffer is mental, the only pool you can run dry on is your knowledge.

It was inspiring as a teenager. As long as you wanted, you could be great. Effort, training and learning was key to becoming mighty.

Which is why I despise magical cores so much. They negate all of this. With them you're just born powerful or weak; you never get a say in it. It's cheap, it's stupid and I hate that its such a wide spread element in fanfiction.
