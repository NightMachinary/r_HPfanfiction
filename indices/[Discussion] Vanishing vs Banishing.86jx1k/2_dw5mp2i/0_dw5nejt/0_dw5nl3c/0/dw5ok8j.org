Wow, that's... Dedication.

And honestly, a very fitting form of revenge you've chosen there.

Personally, I think if the concept isn't used just to show that, "Oh Harry has the biggest magical core since Merlin" or something, or isn't just brought up randomly and actually has some bearing on the story, it can be done right, though it never is. I might have read a couple fics I liked, but I can't remember any right now.
