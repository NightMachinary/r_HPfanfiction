I don't have a book in front of me to give support for this argument, just going from memory, so correct me if I'm wrong. And even if im right this will apply to maybe 5% of the cases youre talking about if that. Also, im more in the weeds here than I think JKR ever bothered with.

To my memory, Dumbledore and maybe others have sommoned things from thin air. Like, they knew where it was and almost apparated it to them. I remember he did this with alcohol sometimes. Now, he may have been conjuting it from memory, but i think he also claimed it was Madam Rosmerta's or something. So wouldn't it be unethical to conjure something that someone sells for profit? And wouldn't there be some kind of magical copyright thing? I think this is more likely a 2nd level of the summoning charm that only masters really perfect or something. He keeps his Mead in his office (or home if anti-apparition jinxes apply) until he needs it, summons it, drinks some, banishes it. If im right and thats a next level summoner, making something disappear from right in front of you to go where you intend it to be would be a next level banisher.

So THAT type of banisher could technically make things disappear, if it works like i think it does.

It's also possible that adding this power to even a few characters like Dumbledore, Voldemort, Flitwick, etc. Would be world-breaking.
