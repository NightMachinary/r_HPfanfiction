It's careless and irritating. Dunno which is worse sometimes, this kind of genre-specific error or basic English: loose/lose your/you're he/him me/i.

I try to be amused rather than angry, but sometimes it's the difference between finishing someone's beloved creative work and binning it.

The other day I read right up to where Dumbledore was reminiscing about his past with poor, deluded Gilbert.

So many fics, so little time.
