  Now I'm not entirely sure this is canon or not but to me, a Banishing charm is pretty much the opposite of the summoning charm, while a vanisher makes the target disappear

Well, you're completely right. Just for context, here are the differences mentioned in the books:

Banishing:

#+begin_quote
  They were supposed to be practising the opposite of the Summoning Charm today -- the Banishing Charm. Owing to the potential for nasty accidents when objects kept flying across the room, Professor Flitwick had given each student a stack of cushions on which to practise, the theory being that these wouldn't hurt anyone if they went off target. It was a good theory, but it wasn't working very well. Neville's aim was so poor that he kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the room -- Professor Flitwick, for instance.

Vanishing:

#+begin_quote
  So ... today we are starting Vanishing Spells. These are easier than Conjuring Spells, which you would not usually attempt until N.E.W.T. level, but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your O.W.L.'

and

#+begin_quote
  There was a genteel tap of the knocker and the musical voice asked, again, ‘Where do vanished objects go?'

  ‘Into non-being, which is to say, everything,' replied Professor McGonagall.

As for, is it justified - I think it is. I get annoyed when people get these things wrong as well. To get it right, all they need to do is look it up in the books, only takes a few seconds. It's just lazy writing.

And also just spelling mistakes. Like people not knowing the difference between 'definitely' and 'defiantly', or between 'breath' and 'breathe'.

Though it's a bit different, the thing that will immediately have me stop reading a fanfic is if the author calls Harry a brunette.
