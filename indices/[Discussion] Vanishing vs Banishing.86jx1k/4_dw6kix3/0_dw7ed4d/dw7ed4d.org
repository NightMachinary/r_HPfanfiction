You've set me off now.

Writers who don't know the difference between 'reign' and 'rein'.

We should bring back the death penalty for 'should of', 'would of' and 'could of', using a method that ensures the perpetrator hurts the whole time they are dying.

Loose/lose could just be a typo, I suppose, but it doesn't make the clenching any less uncomfortable.

Writers who don't get that 'pique', 'peek' and 'peak' are three entirely different words and just use one in all three places or worse, use them at random. That last makes me want to nail their ears to a coffee table.

I could, and at scant provocation will, go on.
