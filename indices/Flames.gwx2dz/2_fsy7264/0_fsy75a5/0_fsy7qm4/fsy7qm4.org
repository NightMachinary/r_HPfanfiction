I think it depends what they are actually saying..........if they say write a lenthy paragraph on why they dont like the story. They have still read it so you could take what they say on board even if its rude

​

But if the flame is just "you suck" or "this is shit"..........how do you know theyve even read it...........whats the point of having it up there? Its taking up space

​

I think people who come in to tell you theyve not even read it because they dont like the pairing..........why even bother informing the writer? its pointless and not needed

​

thats my take
