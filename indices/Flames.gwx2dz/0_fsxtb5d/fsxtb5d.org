One reader scolded me for getting Tonks all wrong. This reader informed me that since Tonks is one of the good guys, she can't have any flaws. This was for a story in which I portrayed young Tonks as starting off with the same anti-werewolf bigotry as the rest of her culture. She overcomes this only later, after she meets Remus.

Another reader was outraged because my POV character believed things that weren't true. I explained the concept of an unreliable narrator, but I don't think it got through.

I enjoy comments like that for showing me how other people's thought processes work. There are some strange ideas out there.
