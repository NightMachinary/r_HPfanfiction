Linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent) has a competent Order that engages with the Death Eaters in pitched battles and generally holds their own. It's very AU from canon because it was written pre-OoTP, so it's much more of an actual war, with outpost attacks and territory changing hands, as opposed to the guerilla war depicted in canon. The war isn't the main focus of the story though, so there's only a few scenes of the battles that aren't mentioned in passing or told as recaps.
