That's basically what Lupin objected to Harry doing in the Battle of the Seven Potters - Harry wasn't being /lethal/ enough. If anything, I don't think they shy away from killing. Moody kills Evan Rosier when he isn't compliant (and Sirius even praises him for 'bringing people alive when possible'), Dumbledore sacrificed Emmeline Vance for Snape's spy position and Lupin goes on a full tirade of why Harry should be killing, and 'at least stunning'.

Edit: a word... complicity is not the same as compliance :P
