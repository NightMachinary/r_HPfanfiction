In Wind Shear the Order doesn't exist yet, but Harry hooks up with 'the old crowd'. These are veterans of Grindelwald's war. People like Neville's grandfather and Charlus Potter. It's implied before the first war heated up, Voldemort had these elder statesmen picked off before they really understood what was happening. With Harry's future warning... They're in one depicted battle and they utterly destroy Voldemort's forces. Wind Shear linkffn(12511998)
