  Yeah, but one of those teens was Hermione.

Hermione's a very intelligent person, yes. But Gringotts has been around for centuries with the best and the brightest (some I'd wager much brighter than Hermione) behind it. And it's not like they broke in with any new technology, they just turned 1 employee, stole a wand and hair, and used Imperio a bunch of times.

  Anyway, I got the impression it wasn't that it was so hard to break into, but that it was near impossible to get out.
#+end_quote

I got that too, but I feel like (1) that wasn't the intended feeling (i.e. JK wanted it to feel hard to break into, which it honestly wasn't) and (2) Imo that's a pretty bad design philosophy.

  Normally, you'd be hunted immediately, posters everywhere.

That's actually a really, really good point (kudos). I can think of ways around that (or situations where it'd fail), but I hadn't considered that possibility.
