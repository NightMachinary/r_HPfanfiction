Yeah, but one of those teens was Hermione.

Anyway, I got the impression it wasn't that it was so hard to break into, but that it was near impossible to get out. If it wasn't a war, and they actually cared about anonymity, and weren't so desperate, they'd never escape that way, they'd be caught. Because it was war, and they saved the world, I assume the Ministry just smoothed it over best they could. Normally, you'd be hunted immediately, posters everywhere.

I personally feel Quirrell's heist more unbelievable. He apparently wasn't possessed at the time, so it was all him, and he seems to have gotten away unrecognized. Granted, he was actually a pretty decent wizard, but he was still one person.
