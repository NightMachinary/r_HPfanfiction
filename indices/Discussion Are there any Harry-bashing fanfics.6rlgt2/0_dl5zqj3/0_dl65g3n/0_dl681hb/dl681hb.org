My favourite wtf moment in the Harry Potter canon as a story writer is when JKR weaves this complex set of circumstances for Harry to solve in Half Blood Prince, and Harry solves them all... by taking a freakin' luck potion. How hard JKR had to work to make Harry as unmanipulative as he is. No, no. Can't have our paragon hero taking initiative and actually having to be cunning. That would send all sorts of wrong messages. Better make it literal Magus Ex Machina.
