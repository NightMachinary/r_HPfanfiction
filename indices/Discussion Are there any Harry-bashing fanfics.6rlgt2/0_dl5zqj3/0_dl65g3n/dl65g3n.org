I totally agree. Canon Harry is being held in very low regard in the fanfic world. Almost all popular fics involve a Harry who is significantly more competent, intelligent, powerful, proactive, and ruthless.

JKR wanted to write a story in which a not so great (better than average though) main protagonist beat a Hitler with superpowers. But the hero apparently needed an insane amount of luck, on top of deux ex machina, author fiat, plot armor, and assigning idiot ball to the villain.
