I think Harry is in fact probably the /most/ bashed character. He just isn't usually bashed in the same way as, say, Hermione or Ginny. Just about every indy!Harry fic, for example, is an indirect bash of Harry's rather passive behaviour in canon. Every grey!Harry fic is an indirect bash at his morality. Every smut!Harry fic is a bash of his utter lack of sex drive/willingness to act on it. Etc.
