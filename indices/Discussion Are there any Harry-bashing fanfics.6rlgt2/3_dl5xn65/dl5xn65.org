Bashing fics tend to be bad and I don't generally keep track of them. Several Hernione/Draco fics have this as a staple.

That said, there's no shortage of fics where Harry is not a particularly sympathetic figure. [[http://fanfiction.tenhawkpresents.com/viewstory.php?sid=35][Alexander Harris and the Shadow Council]] portrays him as a slacker who wastes his natural gifts. linkffn(The Golden Age by Arnisoe de Blassenvile) humanizes him in a less than heroic way. linkffn(betrayal by butalearner) turns him into a ruthless killer.
