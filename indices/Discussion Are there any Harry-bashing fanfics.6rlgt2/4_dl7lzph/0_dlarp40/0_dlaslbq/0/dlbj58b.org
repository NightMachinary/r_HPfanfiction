I had read some other stuff by her so I knew what I was in for, but I wasn't expecting Ginny's life to touch me as much as it did. She wanted a place of her own and to follow her own dreams, she built the life she wanted and it was taken away from her. The dollhouse killed me.

It reminded me a bit of the Discworld book 'Witches Abroad' - the power of stories playing out regardless of who is crushed under the wheel of narrative. Harry's story, his perhaps unconscious desire to live out the life his parents began, crushed a lot of others.
