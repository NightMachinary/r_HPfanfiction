Everyone is sane and normal except Dumbledore, who's gone senile, Harry, who's beyond stupid, and Voldemort, who's even stupider.

Highlights include Remus trying to convince Harry to turn over his cloak because no one (good guys or bad guys) trusts him with it.

  "Whatever." Harry went back to being a sulky little boy again, much to the relief of a certain very famous white-clad wizard who had been about to come out of retirement and thwap him one on the ear. "Anyway, Dumbledore gave it to me, and I don't see why I should give it to you."

  Lupin regarded Harry a long moment. Sirius watched him closely. He knew that expression. Remus was turning something diabolical over in his head. "The cloak doesn't actually belong to you," Lupin said at last. "It belongs to your father."

  "Yeah, so?" Harry kicked at the floor. "Dad's dead."

  "No." Lupin was more conversant with Muggle culture than most wizards and realized he should have donned a shiny black helmet and done some heavy breathing to make his next statement more appropriately dramatic. Still. . . "I am your father, Harry."

  Harry's mouth fell open. So did Sirius's -- at the sheer audacity of Lupin's scheme. Fortunately, Harry wasn't looking in his godfather's direction. A moment of silence passed. "Dad?" asked Harry weakly, at last. "But. . . that's not possible! Everyone says I look just like you an' I don't!"

  Lupin stifled a sigh. Harry was even stupider than he'd suspected. "The real Remus Lupin and I used a Switching Spell sixteen years ago, back when we knew Voldemort planned to attack us. So I am your father James in Lupin's body."

  "Oh," said Harry.

  "But. . . why didn't you save Mummy the day Voldemort came to kill me?"

  "It was a full moon that night," said Lupin sadly, "and unfortunately, since I was in a werewolf's body, I changed shape. And of course poor Remus was too clumsy a wizard to fend Voldemort off -- "

  Sirius hastily turned his laugh into a sneeze. But Harry nodded wisely. It only stood to reason that his father would be a much better wizard than some dumb werewolf.
