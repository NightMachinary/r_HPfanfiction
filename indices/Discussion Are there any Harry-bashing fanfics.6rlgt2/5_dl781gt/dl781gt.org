Pretty much anything with a Draco/Ginny pairing has Harry bashing, because why would Ginny go for Draco unless Harry was actually horrible. (But actually, the ones with Harry bashing tend to be the really poorly written ones).

Honestly any Slytherin/Hermione or Ginny, because of reasons stated elsewhere in the comments.
