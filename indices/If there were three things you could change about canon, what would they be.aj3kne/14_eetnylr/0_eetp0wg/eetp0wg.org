  Have Ginny befriend Harry after his name comes out the cup.

Yes, please! If you're going to make that a pairing, then you need to give them moments before the kiss and stuff leading up to it. If you have to one Weasley member stop being friends with Harry, then let another Weasley family member take Ron's place in the mean time.

Or hell, let Harry and Ginny get to know each other sooner, after Ginny was brain washed of sorts, from Voldemort's diary, Harry never tried to make sure that Ginny was okay, and that always striked me as odd. I know that he was closer to Ron then any of the other Weasley's, but you'd still think he'd write to Ginny or something to make sure she was okay after everything.
