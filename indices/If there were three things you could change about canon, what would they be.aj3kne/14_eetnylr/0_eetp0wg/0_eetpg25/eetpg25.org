Yeah they really could have done with a lot more moments between them, like Harry seeking her out and apologising for forgetting about her possession. They're my OTP, but really that's more because of fanfics than anything in the books.

I'd also like to see a bit more of that summer before 6th year, just the trio and Ginny hanging out and being teenagers at the Burrow.
