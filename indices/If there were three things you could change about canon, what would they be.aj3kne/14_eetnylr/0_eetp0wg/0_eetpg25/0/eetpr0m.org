Like boom! Harry kisses Ginny and that's it, they're together. He suddenly got a crush on her and it was so random and out there, it would be like him suddenly having a crush on Luna or Hermione out of the blue, like that. Just so strange how she did it. Though to be fair I always thought the romance was her weakest writing points.

(For me, personally; anyway).
