1. Make harry atleast a somewhat powerful hero. I mean the guy really killed a basilisk, can cast a patronus that can drive away a hundred dementors, can side along apparate to a great distance just on his first try. It always irked when harrys true potential was never explored, and in the end it was made out he just defeated Voldemort on just pure luck

2. Downplaying Dumbledores manipulation to a ridiculous level. The man confesses in ootp that he was aware of Harry's abuse yet harry instantly forgives him, the same happens in the king cross scene in deathly hallows.. this is the exact wordings from the book " Dumbledore patted Harry's hand, and Harry looked up at the old man and smiled; he could not help himself. How coul dhe remain angry with Dumbledore now? ".... I mean seriously man...the guy witheld every ounce of information from you....and you instantly forgive him....

3. Rowling never focussed much on the payback the bad guy got, it seemed as if it was just mentioned in passing, while she went so much in detail on the injustice that was done to th good guys. Malfoy should have suffered so much more for all the shit he did throughout his school life, Umbridge should have been flayed alive for even exisiting, Dursley should have burned in hell, and I don't even want to talk about Snape...

4. Would have loved to have seen harry with Hermione.

5. And last but not least," Albus Severus potter...I'm truly very sad you have a crappy name""
