  The way that Snape is some sort of hero doesn't sit well with me because regardless of doing one thing out of love for his lost love he was a terrible person and basically did it for selfish reasons
#+end_quote

he didn't do 'one thing', he did several things. he wanted to atone for his past wrongs and he actively tried to save lives where he could

as for the question:

- lucius and narcissa are killed. they're evil, and i think their walking free after DH is kind of ridiculous. per pottermore, draco is still having dinner with his unrepentant parents even into adulthood. he's still in a limbo of sorts as a grown man, even though he's no longer a bigot. i think his parents are a huge part of that. their deaths would make it a lot easier for him to resist any potential expectation that may be put on him, in a way draco wouldn't have the initiative or courage to do otherwise

- ditto with vernon and petunia, but to a lesser extent

- scrap snape being a professor entirely. give him a more active role in defeating voldemort, and more opportunities to show off his skills. he doesn't die at the end of the series, and walks free
