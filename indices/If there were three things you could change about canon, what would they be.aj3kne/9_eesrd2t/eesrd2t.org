In the spirit of the question I'm going to focus on discrete changes which leave canon largely intact.

*ONE: THE HERO'S PATH*

Make mild adjustments to HBP to make Harry better at magic. Not super Harry or anything like that, just enough for us to respect him more as a character and progress his "hero's journey" arc that was running through the Patronus training/Triwizard Tournament/Dumbledore's Army.

HBP was full of references to how much Harry was struggling with magic; I'd remove those and replace them with a few sections pointing in the opposite direction. First and foremost I'd make him good at non-verbal magic, which really he should be good at, drawing on his strength of will from the Imperius and Priori Incantatem incidents in GOF. He was bad at occlumency but that was because of poor emotional control, not because of a lack of will/focus.

In addition to making him better at non-verbal magic, I'd insert a couple sections about how he was finding his classes easier as he was coming into his own. By the time DH comes around, in canon Harry suddenly pulled out a load of new spells we never saw him learn (Confringo etc.) so I'd /show/ him actually learning them in HBP to give him a greater sense of being proactive after hearing the prophecy.

*TWO: HALLOWS FORESHADOWING*

I'd foreshadow the Hallows much more, throughout the books. JKR has historically been very good at foreshadowing. The horcruxes in particular were a masterwork of foreshadowing, with major elements as early as CoS. I'd do something similar for the Hallows -- given that they are instrumental to Voldemort's defeat, the reader deserves to have more of an "Aha!" moment at the end of DH when everything comes together.

I genuinely think JKR just didn't invent the hallows until post-OotP at the earliest, and possibly even not until post-HBP. By which time it was too late to foreshadow them - the best she could do was go back and co-opt pre-existing story elements such as the ring horcrux.

*THREE: TEEN RATING IN LATER BOOKS*

I'd progress the tone of the books as the characters age, so that the later books were more YA in tone than children's stories. So basically: more direct speech strong language, rather than secondary speech like "Ron swore"; and more sexual references/jokes.
