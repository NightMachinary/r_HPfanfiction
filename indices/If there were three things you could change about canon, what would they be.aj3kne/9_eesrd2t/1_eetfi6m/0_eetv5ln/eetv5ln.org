I think we agree, it's just that the English language gives the word "will" several meanings which is obscuring our agreement.

Willpower can mean having self-control, the ability to resist your own desires. A synonym for this type of willpower is "discipline".

Willpower can also mean having force of will, the ability to resist the will of other people. A synonym for this type of willpower is "stubbornness".

It was the latter type of willpower which was involved in Harry overcoming the Imperius Curse and winning the Priori Incantatem against Voldemort.

It is the former type of willpower which occlumency requires, which Harry lacked (past tense because he learns in in DH after Dobby dies). Occlumency is all about having discipline over your own thoughts whereas Harry lets his thoughts go wherever they are led by his emotions.

When it comes to not wanting to learn occlumency in OotP, Harry's problem was being too immature to (a) set aside his dislike of his teacher and (b) defer to the wisdom of more learned individuals regarding the need to learn it. These are both problems of discipline, i.e. the former type of willpower.

I believe the performance of non-verbal magic has more to do with the latter type of willpower - the force of will type, not the discipline type. So Harry's failings at occlumency do not mean he should be bad at non-verbal magic, as they have their sources in a different type of willpower.

(There's actually a third meaning of "will", but let's keep it simple. My headcanon doc has full details).
