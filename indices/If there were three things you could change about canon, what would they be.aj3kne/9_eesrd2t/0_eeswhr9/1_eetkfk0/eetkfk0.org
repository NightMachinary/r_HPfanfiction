  Harry the Magic Savant

I don't really think he was. As seen with Neville, they seemed to have situational greatness. There's a reason Harry was able to cast such a powerful patronus, even though it was his first time. And to a lesser extent, even Ron does this. With his near-broken wand, designed to be entirely against him, in first year, he managed to cast his first levitation charm on a troll's club, which is quite heavier than a feather.

You want a magical savant, that's Snape, Voldemort, or Dumbledore,
