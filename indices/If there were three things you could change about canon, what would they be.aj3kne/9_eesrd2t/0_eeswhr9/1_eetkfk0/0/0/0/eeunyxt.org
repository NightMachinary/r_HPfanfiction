I think I mostly agree with you, but we're mostly getting hung up on a specific word (savant) that I mostly just threw into my OP because I didn't have a more descriptive word for it.

I think it's pretty unquestionable that Harry sort of gets an aptitude nerf in the later books of the series that can't just be attributed to him having poor work ethic. HBP in particular goes out of its way to show Harry struggling with magic in ways that seem to contradict previously established abilities (as [[/u/Taure]] pointed out with non-verbal magic), and I guess we could mention the point about adrenaline and life-or-death situations but I think it's poor writing to make your protagonist unspectacular 99% of the time but then constantly write him succeeding in situations where he should fail; it completely defeats the point of writing a "normal" protagonist.

I also think that the fact that Harry's role was seemingly rewritten halfway through the series brings up a lot of problems for the dynamic of the trio later on in the series, because it essentially makes Ron a redundant character since Harry now takes up both the role of the hero as well as the slacker everyman in the party that the average reader identifies with. Maybe JKR wanted to subvert the trope of the prophesied hero getting a magic sword and slaying the evil wizard, but it doesn't work as well when she basically writes Harry as Ron but moodier and with a shitty childhood.
