All three of them are exceptional, even if Ron doesn't apply himself, but to call them savants is misleading. Hermione's incredibly diligent and intelligent. Harry has great magical aptitude. And Ron's been shown to excel even when he half-asses things. But let's look at the other three.

Snape, according to Sirius, knew more dark magic coming into Hogwarts than most seventh years. He invented spells in as a teenager and corrected text books. He was also the greatest in occlumency, maybe second to Dumbledore, being able to keep Voldemort out for years.

I'm sure Dumbledore and Voldemort don't need explaining, as their accomplishments speak for themselves, even at young ages.
