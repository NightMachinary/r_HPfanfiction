I somewhat disagree. You're right that Harry often succeeds in life-or-death situations, but I think there's plenty of proof that Harry did have raw power: being able to throw off an imperius curse in a classroom setting, which is the exact opposite of a life-or-death situation, is nothing to sneeze at. What sets people like Snape, Voldemort, and Dumbledore apart from him is the fact that they were not only powerful, but driven as well. Essentially, all three of them are Harry with Hermione's work ethic, without a Ron to keep them grounded and on the right path. That flaw of Harry's is remedied by the fact that Hermione and Ron exist, so while he'd never be as strong enough alone, together they can defeat Voldemort, neatly slotting into the theme that love (or friendship) can overcome evil. But if you diminish Harry's magical ability, then the trio add up to one slightly better than average wizard and aren't a match for Voldemort without winning via Deus ex Machina, which canon pretty much does by introducing the Hallows.
