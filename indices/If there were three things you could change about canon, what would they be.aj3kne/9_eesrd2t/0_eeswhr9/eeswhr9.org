I really never understood why JKR scrapped the Hero's Journey arc through the first four books. I guess she wanted Harry to be the Everyman because that was more relatable, but wasn't that the entire point of Ron's character? He's the (relatively) normal kid keeping Harry the Magic Savant and Hermione the Know-It-All grounded. Suddenly making Harry struggle at magic, especially when he seems to intuitively understand it beforehand, undercut his role as the protagonist immensely in the last couple of books.
