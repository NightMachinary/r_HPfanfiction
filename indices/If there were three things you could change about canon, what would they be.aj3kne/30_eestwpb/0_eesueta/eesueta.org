  While I think Dumbledore's lessons in sixth year were stupid in the way they were done, I don't think even Dumbledore could have trained Harry to be able to stand up to Voldemort in a duel. Voldemort had decades of experience over Harry. Harry wasn't catching up anytime soon. Still, something more could have helped, if only against the Death Eaters.

Just an idea, but I always liked how Harry (or the idealized idea of Harry) could inspire people. So him continuing in the vein of the DA and training some kind of resistance has some appeal for me.

Voldemort being defeated by a thousand mosquito bites might be cool.

Rowling had the right idea by making Harry virtuous and having strength of character instead of going the superhero "solve all the problems with might" kind of way.
