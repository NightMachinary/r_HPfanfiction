  Dumbledore not training Harry in anything but history was total crap and kind of made the final battle anticlimactic as the magic was pretty basic compared to Dumbledore vs Voldemort which was epic.

While I think Dumbledore's lessons in sixth year were stupid in the way they were done, I don't think even Dumbledore could have trained Harry to be able to stand up to Voldemort in a duel. Voldemort had decades of experience over Harry. Harry wasn't catching up anytime soon. Still, /something/ more could have helped, if only against the Death Eaters.

And though I understand why JKR went the way she did in the final battle (it was never going to be some epic fantasy-esque duel), I also think it could have been made better. Perhaps Harry & Voldemort race to the Room of Requirement to get the Diadem, and rather than dueling Voldemort head on, Harry has to just keep Voldemort behind him. Or something, I dunno.

As for my own choices, one would be to make Harry more proactive and generally better at magic. It seemed like JKR was going in this direction with Prisoner of Azkaban, but then decided to make him more just above average when it came to his peers.

As for two other things, I agree with [[/u/Deathcrow]]. 2) Scrap HBP and 3) Scrap DH. Especially in regards to Hermione's character. Everytime I relisten to those two audiobooks I want to write a Hermione bashing story just to get the frustration out of my system.
