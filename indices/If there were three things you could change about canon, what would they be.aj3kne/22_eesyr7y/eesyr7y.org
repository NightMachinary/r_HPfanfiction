1. I was also deeply dissatisfied with Snape's character arc, but I would have preferred if he actually was depicted like "some sort of hero." What I wanted from Snape's character was an exploration of how somebody can be the kind of shitty person who holds a grudge and is mean to kids without actually being /evil/. I wanted a Snape with an actual moral compass, free from the implication that he's motivated solely by his love for a single woman. I deeply resent that JKR derailed this characterization.

2. Draco Malfoy would get an actual redemption arc where he's shown to grow past his father's racist attitudes. And we would end up with a more nuanced view of Slytherin house in general.

3. I would get rid of the epilogue, because it needlessly narrows future possibilities, and the same-old mirroring of previous generations that it does is frankly depressing.
