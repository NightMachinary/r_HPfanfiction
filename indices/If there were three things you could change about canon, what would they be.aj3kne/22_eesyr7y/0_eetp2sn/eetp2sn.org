You know what would have been awesome? If TPT had shown, instead of Snape turning to the Light because of Lily, Snape coming to Dumbledore of his own free will and offering to spy for him.

I mean, we know he was very young when he was recruited, and as we know, terrorist organizations and gangs etc have really good methods of drawing disenfranchised youth into their fold. Now imagine if Snape had been brought to the DE on the premise of people who appreciate his talents, people who want to protect the WW from the dangerous Muggles (given what we know of his home life he would absolutely buy into that) and so on. And then he gets in and he sees what it's actually about and he's like 'this is not what I signed up for' because he's an arsehole, but not a fucking murderer and he's not here for genocide.

So he goes to Dumbledore and he's like 'Big V is horrible and I've made bad choices, let me help you bring him down'.

You don't even have to cut Lily out entirely. Make her his only friend, have the whole story with their relationship play out as it did, but don't make her his only motivation for changing sides. It's disrespectful to both of them - Lily turns into a character with no more purpose than to motivate a man, and it leaves Snape ambiguous by implying he never would have turned if it hadn't been for her being threatened. Honestly his story would have been much better if he saw the evil of the DE for himself, and has to live with the regret that his choices cost him his only real friend.
