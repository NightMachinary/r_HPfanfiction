I wouldn't go so far as to call him a creepy stalker, or his feelings for Lily 'obsession'. For one thing, a Patronus change indicates true soul-deep love, which is incompatible with obsession.

For another, I don't really see anything stalkerish about their relationship, just a friendship between a normal, popular girl and a boy who has trouble interacting with people.
