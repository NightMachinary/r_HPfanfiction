Honestly?I disagree with your number 2. No amount of training was going to help Harry against Voldemort. It just wouldn't make sense.

Voldemort was the most talented of his generation, had 60 years to train, learn and practice magic/dueling, did all sorts of dark magic and rituals to improve his body and no doubt his magic...

What does Harry have? 5 years of traumatic experiences, dicking around and mediocre learning? He could have had 5 years of one on ones with Dumbledore anyday and it wouldn't do him any good.

The only way for HP to beat Voldy was ALWAYS going to be some sort of MacGuffin. It would always be a one sided fight otherwise. The fact that Voldemort didn't wipe Harry out on the first move with a wave of Fyendfire is a mercy.
