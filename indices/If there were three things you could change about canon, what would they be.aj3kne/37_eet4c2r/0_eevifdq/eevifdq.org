  Voldemort was the most talented of his generation, had 60 years to train, learn and practice magic/dueling, did all sorts of dark magic and rituals to improve his body and no doubt his magic...

While I don't disagree with you, the gap between Dumbledore and Voldemort was about ~60 years old. And Dumbledore needed the Elder Wand and his Pheonix to be able to equally fight Voldemort. So, Harry becoming as powerful as Voldemort technically is canonically possible, but he would have to be as big of a prodigy as Voldemort was, and Harry is nowhere close to that.
