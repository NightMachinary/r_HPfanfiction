  while Voldemort was restored to an optimal body

Not correct. I even have proof

#+begin_quote
  "There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer's Stone anymore, for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality. I set my sights lower ... *I would settle for my old body back again, and my old strength*
#+end_quote

Which means that his body was still as old as it was when he died. If he had the philosophers stone he would have gotten the optimal body.

#+begin_quote
  Plus, like I said, the willingness to go through dark rituals probably had something to do with that.
#+end_quote

Even though we have little canonical proof, yeah, that probably is correct
