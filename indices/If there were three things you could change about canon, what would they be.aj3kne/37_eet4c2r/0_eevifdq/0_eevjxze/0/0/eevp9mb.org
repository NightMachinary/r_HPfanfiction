Yeah, and his old body is still half as young as Dumbledore's.

I get the point you were making. I am not saying that raw talent and tenacity can't make up for experience and age. But there has to be a limit. When the difference is too big I just don't see how.

The most skilled 12 years old martial arts master in the world isn't going to beat, say, the guy who plays The Mountain. Even though technique compensates for size difference.

Voldemort only had half as much time as Dumbledore, but Harry has 1/5 of Voldemort. If that.
