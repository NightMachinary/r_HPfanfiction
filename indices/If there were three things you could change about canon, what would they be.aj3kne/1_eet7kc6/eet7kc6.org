1. Epilogue - it was just too clichéd.

2. Never have emphasized how Ron was “incredibly strategic” in Book 1 only to not further develop that characteristic in him throughout the rest of the series.

3. How most of the messed up things that happened in the last 3 books didn't accurately reflect the characters she'd previously created, and only served to move the story in the direction she needed.

4. Having shown more house unity especially after having the Sorting Hat make up an entire song in OOTP about it's importance in times of trouble.
