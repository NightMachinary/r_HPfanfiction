I definitely agree with Snape and Dumbledore points. The only reason Snape became a turncoat was that Voldie targeted Lily. If Harry wasn't born or was born on a different month, Snape would still be a Death Eater loyal to the Dark Lord.

As for Dumbledore, the history lesson was pointless and boiled the "final battle" to Expelliarmus and Avada Kedavra. It's...pointless in the end and after the Dumbledore vs Voldemort battle in Order of the Phoenix, it's kind of a let down.
