1. All Slytherins are evil (Tbh Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw also deserve better). Actually have unity people.
2. Replace the epilogue with something like Cauterize.
3. More mature themes? Harry turning out pretty undamaged by the Dursleys was rather frustrating, but then again its also meant for children (I think?). Plus they're all teenagers and while there are spectacular moments of angst and drama, it felt too little (probably because of my weirdness but still). And how are they not traumatised?
4. I wished there was like at least some mention of substance abuse or similar stuff. I mean some of the potions sound amazing and very easy to get addicted to.
5. This is more than three but meh. I wanted more Luna because she felt like an amazing character.
6. The vampire at slughorn's ball. He would be /so/ interesting.
7. Chest monster was just weird.
8. Cursed child should be burnt and the ashes sent to hell.

Edit:

Oh yeah and the last minute points were terrible imo.
