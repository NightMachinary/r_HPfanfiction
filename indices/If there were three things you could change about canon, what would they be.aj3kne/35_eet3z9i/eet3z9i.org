1.) I would change the relationships No Harry/Ginny No Ron/Hermione No Remus/Tonks

2.) Fixing Dumbledores Mistakes Dumbledore should have told Harry the prophecy In book 1 as well as the Horcruxes earlier Dumbledore should have started training Harry during 5th year or before Dumbledore did not need to space out watching the memories in the 6th book. He should have finished the memories in one or two sessions
