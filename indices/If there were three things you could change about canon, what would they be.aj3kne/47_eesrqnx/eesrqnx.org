Great question!

This might be a bit different to some answers, but, I actually have (little to) no qualms with the epilogue, call me old fashioned, and the main pairings, so these will just be small things.

1. Less final pairings of people they dated when they were 16-17. JK, you established that wizards are longer-lived than Muggles, so everyone getting married to their teenage friends and/or getting married and having kids at 20-21 is really unrealistic. I would be fine with keeping Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny, but would prefer them to be two outliers among their classmates which would also help them stand out due to their experiences.

2. Lupin/Tonks is never a thing and Lupin is canonically bisexual or gay. He might still need to die for thematic/JK's endgame purposes, unfortunately, but we would neatly sidestep the weird absentee!father + adventurer/reliving his youth Lupin beat that we hit in DH, the weird student-teacher thing, and the sudden (what I feel to be) straightwashing of a character explicitly introduced as an allegory of someone living with HIV, written at a time when that was strongly connotated with the LGBT community. Also, by extension this would probably spare Tonks and leave Harry and co with a female role model who isn't a matron or an old maid, as well as sparing Andromeda what in canon feels like a harsh belated punishment for leaving the Blacks.

3. Ron doesn't choose to leave out of the blue in DH, or, if he has to leave, some other means comes up or it is more explicitly caused by the Horcrux. After the same beat happening in GOF, it struck me as off for it to repeat, as well as out of character a little for it to be the boy raised in poverty on hand-me-downs and rough and tumble play who breaks from a few months in the outdoors, as opposed to Harry or Hermione. I would have found Hermione snapping to be more realistic, as well as stronger thematically and from a story perspective to both equalize Ron and Hermione as Harry's friends, as well as to bring them together as having similar flaws, and also to come full circle to book 1 when Ron was Harry's first real friend. It would also help to counter the image of movie!Ron as useless and a poor friend.
