  Lupin/Tonks is never a thing and Lupin is canonically bisexual or gay. He might still need to die for thematic/JK's endgame purposes, unfortunately, but we would neatly sidestep the weird absentee!father + adventurer/reliving his youth Lupin beat that we hit in DH, the weird student-teacher thing, and the sudden (what I feel to be) straightwashing of a character explicitly introduced as an allegory of someone living with HIV, written at a time when that was strongly connotated with the LGBT community.

If you're making an allegory (which I think Rowling was), I think it's helpful not to hit the nail /too/ hard. Basically it's better for the sake of the allegory if Lupin isn't gay because if he was, readers might just think that other characters don't like him because he's gay. The theme that I get from Rowling (see also hatred of muggleborns) is that people will find something to hate about other people even if it seems ridiculous to other people. Making Lupin gay would dilute that theme.
