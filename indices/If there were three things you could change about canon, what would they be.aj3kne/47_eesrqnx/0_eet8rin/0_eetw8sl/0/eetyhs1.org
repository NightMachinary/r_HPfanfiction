I am talking about making an allegory. An allegory uses symbolism to convey a wider point. It doesn't explicitly use the thing it's trying to make a point about. It wouldn't be an allegory if it was explicitly stated to be about gay people and/or those with HIV/AIDS. It would be a noble thing to write, but it wouldn't be an allegory.
