I know what an allegory is.

I just think its mean to queercode characters and then pair them up, and then to also explicitly rule out bisexuality.

Sure, Lupin may have been an HIV metaphor - but his 'condition' also works as a nice implicit metaphor for being a gay teacher written at a time when homosexuality and pedophilia were strongly conflated by the mass media.

As a queer kid growing up who didn't know about STDs that was always my take-away - confirmed bachelor, good with kids but not a dad, openly a fan of chocolate and sweet foods (just like Dumbledore), never shows any inkling whatsoever of a wife or girlfriend, seems pretty outcast by a society which seems just as heteronormative as our own...I mean, draw your own conclusions but there was a lot of fuel there. Before we even get into his single-minded devotion to Sirius, the hug, the wolf-dog connection, and them buying Harry a present from them both.
