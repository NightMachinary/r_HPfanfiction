Not gonna lie, the first time I read your line about Lupin being canonically gay I did a double take in confusion.

/But/, I took a second to read the sentence again and my brain obviously realized that was a change you were referring to.

Just pointing out that it's an easy misread to make due to the use of the word 'canon'. All it took was me skimming over the number 1 and I misunderstood what you were saying.
