The title of the thread is about three things you would change. Given that I actually even numbered my three choices, how is everyone continuing to miss that this was my #2?

To address that point directly also, it's not like no gay people ever have married the opposite sex and had a kid.

Beyond that as someone who's been an adult in the fandom for a long time, it was tacitly assumed by many fans from POA to GOF and beyond that Lupin and Sirius were lowkey lovers and that JK simply wasn't able to be explicit about it. Both Lupin and Tonks are heavily queercoded as well - which was why then shifting gears and pairing them in HBP came across as a slap in the face for many adult and LGBT fans. JK has since expressed that Lupin and Tonks are both definitely straight addinv fuel to the fire - though no doubt come 2020 she'll u-turn on that for brownie points.

Essentially all my post does is ressurect those beliefs of us early fans before JK had her first apparent u-turn and, apparently, a chunk of the younger fandom went with her for the sake of getting (yet) another heterosexual otp because we didn't have enough of those in the universe.
