1. No Pairings/No Epilogue. The books would have ended far better with them taking the boats back across the lake after graduation and ending as friends.
2. Flesh out at least one decent Slytherin classmate that isn't evil.
3. Rewrite the entirety of HBP. So much in that book makes no sense (the length of time it took Dumbledore to go over TMR history even though the headmaster was dying, the relationship angst that really had no place in the books, no one figuring out that Draco was using the RoR, Hermione's reaction to the HBP, Dumbledore's willingness to potentially sacrifice other students to protect Draco, etc).
