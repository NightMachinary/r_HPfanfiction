I would argue that you should go the other way. Show us that Ravenclaws can be useful for more than to out-Wikipedia +Wikipedia+ Hermione. Show us Hufflepuffs who are courageous out of their loyalty, not just "hard workers" or the spares. I mean, even if the sorting represents the students at age 11, by the time they are adults they are different people. Maybe some Ravenclaw who has overworked himself into burnout/depression. We already have cowardly Gryffindors (Pettigrew) and brave Slytherins (Andromeda Tonks). The best addition would have been Neville as Hufflepuff yet he gets his heroic moment in DH (or scarp that idiocy altogether and focus more on the DoM battle).
