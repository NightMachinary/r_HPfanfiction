Make Dumbledore a character with goals, desires, and abilities rather than a plot device to move the story forward. As a plot device, he makes more sense as a villain. Stop it.

Make more characters 3 dimensional while you are at it. As you note, H/G doesn't really work with how underdeveloped she is a character.

Show more of the social reasons why someone might want to side with the Death Eaters, or be Neutral. This might be harder, as things are mostly from Harry's PoV, but seeing the legitimate conflict inherent in a heavily intermarried wizarding world would increase tension.

Avoid white washing characters based on the trim of their robes. Rowling did a decent job of this with some of the Gryffindors (Lupin running out on his wife and kid, and Sirus's casual cruelty towards Kreacher spring to mind) but she could have let someone from Slytherin not be a jerk. Sure, Snape and Draco have their moment in the end, but that's only after spending 99% of the story as antagonists. Actually write some decent people into the house of the ambitious.

Look more into how the magic system works. As it is, I've heard the HP magic system get compared to X-Men, where it changes as needed. Explore the how and why of magic, rather than treating it like a Swiss army tool. I don't want "change a match stick into a needle" I want the underpinnings of what that exercise demonstrates
