James was not worse than Snape. Snape had shady friends who use dark magic and he thinks it's just harmless fun despite a strong implication of rape occuring. And that was before his "worst memory". Marauders vs Snape and Junior Death Eaters were a fair fight, not bullying. Both shat on the other side.

If you want a reason to hate Ron, look no further than the epilogue. The shit he pulls with his driving instructor is something you'd expect from a Death Eater, not a supposed good guy. Assaulting a Muggle's mind, fraud and violating the Statute of Secrecy (magic in front of a Muggle) with no valid reason to do so. He did it for the bragging rights for fuck's sake.
