  The possibility of rape aside, Snape was pals with Mulciber and his crew during their Hogwarts years. Lily states in Snape's memory that Mulciber used Dark Magic against one of Lily's friends. I remember her describing it as "evil" but I could be mistaken there. Snape laughed and called it, "a bit of fun."

Probably just jinxing or hexing someone. The bat-bogey hex Ginny uses is technically dark magic, so there's an incredibly large margin for interpretation.

  Ron Weasley assaulted a muggle for...nothing. He wanted to pass his driving test to prove to Hermione that he could. In the end he couldn't on his own so he confounded the examiner. It wasn't an evil act, but it wasn't just something to pass off.

Yes, but to compare it to a Death Eater? That's like comparing a man who killed a person, that just so happened to be Jewish, to Heinrich Himmler.
