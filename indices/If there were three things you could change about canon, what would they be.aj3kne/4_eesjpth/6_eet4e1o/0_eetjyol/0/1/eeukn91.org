  Marauders vs Snape and Junior Death Eaters were a fair fight, not bullying. Both shat on the other side.

Except that never happened. As far as we know, it was only James, Sirius, and occasionally Peter, ganging up on Snape. It got to the point where he started expecting it every time they'd approach, so it must have been a pretty common occurrence.

  Assaulting a Muggle's mind, fraud and violating the Statute of Secrecy (magic in front of a Muggle) with no valid reason to do so. He did it for the bragging rights for fuck's sake.
