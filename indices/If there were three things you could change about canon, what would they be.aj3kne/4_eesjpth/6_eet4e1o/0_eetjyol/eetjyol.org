James bullied Snape for years for one snide comment he made about Gryffindor, which James started, the first time they met. Dude even had the gall to use Snape's own spells against him and tried to blackmail Lily into going on a date with him.

Ron just had a temper and some insecurity issues. I'll never understand why the same people that jerk off to the Marauders are so adamantly against Ron.
