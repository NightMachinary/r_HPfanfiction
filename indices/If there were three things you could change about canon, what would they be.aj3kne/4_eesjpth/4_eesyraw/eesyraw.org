I think Horcruxes are ok, but Harry as a Horcrux is BS. I suspect JKR just wanted to force her Jesus analogy through. Duh. A fic writer should absolutely get rid of this cheap ripoff of the Bible.

Even if Harry is a Horcrux and he absolutely has to die, he should not offer himself to execution (where Voldemort could interrogate him first and blew everything), but go out in a blaze of glory like the 300!
