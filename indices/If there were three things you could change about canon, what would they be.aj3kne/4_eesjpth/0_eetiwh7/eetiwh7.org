I disagree with the horcrux removal bit- rowling had something like it planned by book 2 obviously, if not the exact concept then certainly a general idea of "bits of voldemort in a thing". The real issue I had was with the Deathly Hallows, because they were clearly just rowling sitting down at the end of book 5 and being like "ok so that fight scene was amazing but how the fuck do i realistically make harry that powerful in two years?"

I do agree that part of the series would be scrapped in this hypothetical scenario of my dream story.

But most of all the one thing i wanted was more fight scenes like the one at the end of OotP. That was awesome.
