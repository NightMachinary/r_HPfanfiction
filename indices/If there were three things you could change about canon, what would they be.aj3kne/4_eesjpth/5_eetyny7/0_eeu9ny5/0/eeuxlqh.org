But, what was so bad about it?

Harry learnt some really cool spells (Levicorpus) and some which were really not (Sectumsempra - also an excellent example of why not to meddle with dark magic without proper training). It reminded him of the powers of a bezoar without which Ron would be poof by now. It laid the base for the eventual, mind-blowing revelations about Snape. And most importantly, it helped create one of the very few instances in the series where we get a glimpse into Hermione's negative traits - in this case, her ultra-competitive nature and unwillingness to accept defeat graciously.
