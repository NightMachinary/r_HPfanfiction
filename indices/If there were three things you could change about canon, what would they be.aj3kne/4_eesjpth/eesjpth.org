Scrap and rewrite the entirety of HBP and DH.

In detail:

1. No Horcruxes... Harry can still have a mysterious connection to Voldemort that somehow ankers him to this world. That's fine.

2. Dumbledore still has to die in HBP, but let him do something useful in the meanwhile (no bullshit lessons drawn out over a whole school year)

3. No potions book

4. No "Harry thinks Draco is a Death Eater but no one believes him" nonsense

5. Give Ron a plotline that mirrors James'. Getting serious about his studies, trying to be a better person. Realizing that Hermione is better off without him.

6. No Hermione character assassination.

7. Ginny & Luna play a bigger role.

8. Less "Harry the jock" more "oh shit, my two best friends almost died for me, because I ran into a trap, I need to be better".
