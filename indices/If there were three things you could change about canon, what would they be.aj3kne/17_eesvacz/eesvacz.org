My top 3:

1. No Horcruxes. I hated the idea of them, how much they dictated the story, and felt they restricted things far too much, not allowing the story to breathe and expand beyond its boundaries.

2. Better pairings. I know everyone has a different opinion of who should end up with who, but I know for a fact I would have scrapped the Ginny/Harry Pairing, even IF she was "built up" better. For me personally, I would have liked to see Harry end up with either Hermione or Luna. Ginny with Neville, and perhaps Lavender with Ron, or have Ron die in the final battle rather than one of the twins in some heroic fashion, to really put a twist on things. See 3 below on my thoughts on the Weasleys...

3. Removal of the Weasleys as Harry's "crutch". Should they play a role in Harry's life? Sure, but I always felt they were TOO important and it seemed like a setup from the start, and at the end, JK decided it needed to be even more on the nose and so boom.. Harry/Ginny. Instead... develop the Tonks family more. Perhaps have Sirius or Remus/Tonks live. Perhaps make Dumbledore more into a father/mentor figure, or Minerva into a Mother/mentor figure. Anything else. I might get some hate for this particular one... but so be it.
