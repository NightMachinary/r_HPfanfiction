I already don't consider Fantastic Beasts and Cursed Child canon. Aside from that...

1. Agreed with Ginny. Harry's attraction to her seemed to have materialized from out of nowhere. wtf.

2. Make each house more three-dimensional.

See, the house system only realistically works if it's about what traits you /value/ the most. Everyone needs to be hardworking, brave, cunning, and smart! And besides, there's a loot of overlap. A mindset of "study hard" is both Ravenclaw-ish and Hufflepuff-ish, for instance, and "I want to fix the problems in society!" could be both Gryffindor-ish and Slytherin-ish (since people with this mindset could pursue a career in politics and must be cunning).

So there's a lot of room in each house for different characters. I feel like we're just left with the impression that all the Slytherins are arrogant and prejudiced.

1. In general, the worldbuilding is quite flawed. None of the population statistics make sense... ugh...
