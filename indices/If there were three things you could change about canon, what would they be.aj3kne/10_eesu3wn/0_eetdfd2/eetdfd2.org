HBP and DH are like part 1 and 2 of the end. They work together even though I may not agree with everything that happens.

It might be nice to keep the pairings open. Or if there was an epilogue to keep the pairings ambiguous. So that you'd have to guess who the trio ended up with.

The epilogue is pure fluff which is nice but the story doesn't change without it. The best part of the epilogue was Albus Severus. Maybe that part could've been expanded to how all Houses are treated more equally n stuff.

Cursed Child is trash I refuse to accept anything that comes out of it.
