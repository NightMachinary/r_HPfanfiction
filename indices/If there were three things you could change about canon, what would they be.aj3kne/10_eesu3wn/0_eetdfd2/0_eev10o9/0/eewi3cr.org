I like both. This is an unpopular opinion but I like the idea of Harry naming his son Albus Severus. I find it symbolically significant to have a name from two Headmasters of different houses. Snape was a significant background presence in HBP as was Dumbledore in DH. I got the feeling that by "The Flaw in the Plan" Harry had forgiven both of them and somewhat understood their actions in the war. The name "Albus Severus" tied along with the character fretting over his Sorting serves to show that both Houses and their members are worthy of honor and appreciation. This is in stark contrast to Harry panicking in the first book when the Hat suggested Slytherin.

Also, I highly doubt that anyone calls him "Albus Severus" everyday. It would likely be "Al" or "Albus."
