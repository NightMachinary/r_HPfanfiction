  Leaving out Veritaserum and viewable memories entirely or at least give a REASON why they seem to not be used in trials (eg. Sirius trial)

It's actually a minor plot point in GoF that Sirius */did not get a trial/*. In flagrant violation of due process, he was apprehended and immediately thrown into Azkaban, on the orders of Bartemius Crouch Sr.

With that being said, from the little that we do see of the wizarding community's judicial system, it certainly seems that due process does not seem to be a very significant priority.
