1. Instead of the Epilogue occurring 19 years later, have it in September 1998. Harry and Ginny are broken up permanently because they've changed too much and really, those two weeks together were fantastic, but Harry only used Ginny to feel normal and Ginny deserves someone better. She's now happily with someone else, maybe Neville. Harry sees Susan Bones and muses that they have a lot of the same experiences. Ron and Hermione are back to being just friends but they're open to a relationship in the future.
2. Emphasize that Snape was a hero but he was not redeemed.
3. Show some of the trials and funerals and how they plan to rebuild the country instead of returning to the same-old system.
