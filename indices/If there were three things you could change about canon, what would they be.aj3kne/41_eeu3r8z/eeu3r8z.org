My gripe with entire series is that post his brush with death in first book and with knowledge that a certain megalomaniac is gunning for his existence Harry is complacent. If I were to know that a magical savant was trying to kill me I would try to learn as much as magic as possible to try and have an fighting chance at my life. Harry is so "reactive"....learning patronus because dementors affect him,studying magic "because" of tournament. His casual acceptance of abuse from student body aside,he never does anything to rectify the situation. And the less I speak about whole harry-Ginny oedipal complex..............given the amount of life threatening situation Harry/Hermione/Ron have faced together it is much more realistic that they end up in a polyamorous relationship in spite of Ron's insecurities. I myself prefer Harry with Luna. They are equally damaged individuals that somehow complement each other.
