Yes I'm pretty sure extra info from J.K informed that all racists are inherently Slytherin, even if not all Slytherins are racist. I don't dislike the house system as a whole, but I really don't like the way J.K wrote it. You're correct - canonically Slytherin is the 'Evil' house. But rather than scrapping the house or the house system, I would rather it had just been written with nuance. And yes, better role models.
