I personally disagree. Even if there are some genuinely good Slytherins, it doesn't mean that the House /as a whole/ is good. Slytherin promotes some bad role models. Salazar Slytherin himself has a terrible reputation of being almost cartoonishly evil and even their house ghost is a creep who murdered a woman. Also, one of the main values of Slytherin seems to be bigotry, need I say more?

Sending kids to that House is actually cruel. They have 0 good role models (the fact that Snape of all people was their head of house only made things worse) and peer pressure makes their bigotry even worse.
