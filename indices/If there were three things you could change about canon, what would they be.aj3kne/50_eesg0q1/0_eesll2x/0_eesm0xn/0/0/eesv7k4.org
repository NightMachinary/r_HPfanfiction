Yeah I liked that idea too. It makes a lot of sense to be wary of Muggles and Muggleborn at a time like this. I'd imagine Salazar would also be someone who pushed for something like the Statute of Secrecy long before it was established (what a visionary!).

Also it fits the Nazi analogy quite neatly, because they also miss- and re-appropriated historical figures and historical thoughts for their racist cause.
