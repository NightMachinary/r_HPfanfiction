Agree it makes little sense why they'd even continue to have a Slytherin house.

I was quite disappointed with the retconning of Salazar Slytherin. I liked the head cannon that Slytherin advocated for no muggleborns in a time of witch burnings and general danger in the muggle world for muggleborns and their families. Then Pottermore confirmed he was just a big racist, which seems more flat than his ideas being later understood out of context and misappropriated.
