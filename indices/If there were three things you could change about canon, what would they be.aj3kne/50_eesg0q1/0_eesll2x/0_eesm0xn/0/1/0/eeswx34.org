True about the basilisk. Although, on the topic of things we would change in cannon, what was up with leaving a basilisk under the school for 1000+/- years?? How did it even live? What did it eat? How would it pick out muggleborn kids to kill specifically? It seems to just kill everything it runs into with its death stare. Really, that plot point makes zero sense - am I forgetting some explanation from the books?
