I'd argue that showing a decent, non-evil Slytherin character that doesn't need a redemption arc, but is simply ambitious would solve most of the problems that lead to your first request. The redemption arc from Draco need not apply.

Overall, I'd point out that Rowling did half of that job right, by showing that all the houses produce flawed characters, but she didn't do enough to show that Slytherin can produce decent people.
