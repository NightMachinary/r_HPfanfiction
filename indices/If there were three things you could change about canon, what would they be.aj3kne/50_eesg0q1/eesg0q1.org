1)Abolish Slytherin at the end of the series, it had literally 0 redeeming qualities and it's unacceptable that they allowed such a house to exist. If you can't do that, then abolish /all/ houses. Or at least make Slytherin less obviously evil.

2)No pairings. I didn't really like the romance in HP and I feel like the shipping wars damaged the fandom.

3)Change Dumbledore's actions so that they don't appear so nonsensical. (why keep the PS in a school full of children? Why not hide it in a house under the fidelius? Why not do something about Snape's bias as a teacher? Why do nothing about the radicalization of Slytherins? Why do nothing about Draco after two attempted murders?)
