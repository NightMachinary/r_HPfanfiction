1) I'd do away with the house system (or at least, the supposedly-personality-based house system) at the end of the series, rather than abolishing one house. The entire system is rotten, and all Dumbledore can say is “sometimes I think we sort too soon” which shows a grotesque failure of imagination.

When I was reading the first time, I genuinely thought the house system would be abolished at or by the end. I was very disappointed.
