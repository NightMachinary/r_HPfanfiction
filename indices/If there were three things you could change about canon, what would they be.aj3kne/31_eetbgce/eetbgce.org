Honestly one of the things I think about when this question or something similar come up is that, if Voldemort had fought Harry the same way he fought Dumbledore, Harry wouldn't have survived. Sure the Elder wand wouldn't kill Harry but there's plenty of times where he didn't have it and just messed around. It honestly makes the whole story seem... I don't know lame? Or less dramatic? Maybe not the word I'm looking for but Voldemort is basically dumbed down when facing Harry and it takes away from the story in my mind.
