1) Get rid of time-turners entirely. Just scrap it. It was messy, poorly thought out, and completely ridiculous and opened up chasms of inconsistencies and missed opportunities.

2) Let Voldemort stay handsome and persuasive. Keep him soulless, rotten and insane - just show shit like that through actual actions and plot, not looks. Allowing for misguided fascination and actual basis for people to join him would make the story far more interesting. There could also be more political maneuvering.

3) Don't give house elves infinite unchallenged power. The mere fact of them apparating freaking everywhere (e.g. Hogwarts) makes everyone seem like a fool for not using them.
