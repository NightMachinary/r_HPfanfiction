Hmmm... three things? Okay, I have three things.

1: Give Ron a break. Seriously, the guy spent seven books only being the overshadowed sidekick and the universe's chew-toy while everyone around him got more attention and more importance. He was allowed to be upset about this, but not to actually do anything about it... after the first book, pretty much EVERY success he has takes place either totally off-screen, or it's overshadowed because Harry (and occasionally Hermione) has something more important going on, or both.

2: Move out of Harry's head more. Alternately, keep to Harry's POV for six book and then have the seventh book be multiple POV. That would really underline that this was the Big One, and how the entire wizarding world of Britain were fighting or suffering, not just Harry.

3: More girls. Seriously. The only girl who plays a central role in all seven books is Hermione. Ginny's a background character in more than half the books, Luna doesn't even appear until the fifth one, and all other girls are either minor characters or just get one book to have any sort of important role. The HP series is a boy's club... while that's okay for some series, I always get the feeling that JKR didn't INTEND for this series to be.

If I'm allowed to have a fourth thing, then it would be NO PROPHECY. I hate prophecies in fiction, they're terribly overplayed. But if I was given a choice, I'd change the above three things and keep the prophecy, rather than the other way around.
