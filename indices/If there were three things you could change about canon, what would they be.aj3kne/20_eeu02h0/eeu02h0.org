Unpopular opinion, but I wouldn't change anything major. Are there flaws? Sure, but I like the books the way they are. And if I want to see something different, that's what fanfiction is for, isn't it?

Anyway,

1. Develop Harry/Ginny relationship more or scrap it from the epilogue altogether. The way it is written in HBP is pretty realistic... for a mild crush on Harry's part where the romance would be over in 2 months anyway.
2. Introduce one or two good Slytherin students.
3. Maybe some minor scene of comeuppance for the Dursleys.
