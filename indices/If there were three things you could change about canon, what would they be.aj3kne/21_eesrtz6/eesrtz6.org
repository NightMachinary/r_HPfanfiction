1) Completely redevelop HBP and DH plot. As things stand right now, Dumbledore was utterly ineffective and criminally negligent in HBP; and DH is a disappointing collection of Deus Ex Machina, author fiat, plot armors, “lucky hero” trope, and “good guys don't kill” trope. Harry's walk to his execution is nothing but a cheap ripoff of the Bible.

2) No pairings or develop them well. If Harry gets together with a girl other than Hermione, make her an integral part of the story.

3) Remove all inconsistencies. Too many magical devices were used once and then never again. They must stand the test of repeat uses and still not breaking the story.
