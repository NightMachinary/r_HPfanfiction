- Make a few elements of the magic simpler and more sensical. For example: use the fanon version of the Trace, the one that's a spell put on the wand that detects magic in the vicinity (but not necessarily from that wand). It makes everything make a lot more sense.

- Kick out the Chest Monster into the darkest abyss. Shoo.

- Fix some of the worldbuilding. For example, show us some male Veelas, or else explicitly tell us they reproduce in some weird non-gendered way. Avoid making Dementors irredeemably evil --- just say the ones in Azkaban are cranks. (You managed it for Goblins! And Elves!) Think about the implications of stating snakes are sapient in your universe more than five seconds. Consider that if magic is advancing rather than receding, you can't just handwave away the couple of actually powerful ancient artifacts that we see --- the Resurrection Stone should be as surprising as finding a medieval nuclear reactor.
