I've always figured that Veela are kind of like the Asari - they can reproduce with humans or house elves or goblins or centaurs or whatever they like, but the offspring is always Veela, and always female.

Ofc this is not supported by canon since Fleur is speculated to be part-Veela, but I like it anyway.
