I cannot speak for reproduction with other humanoid species such as house-elves, goblins, or centaurs, since none of the above are mentioned in canon.

In the specific case of Veela/human interreproduction, however, I think you're not that far off the mark. As Bill Nye used to say, consider the following:

- Fleur's grandmother is a veela. Which one(paternal or maternal) is never explicitly stated, but can be inferred from subsequent details.
- Fleur has no male siblings that we know of; Her only identified sibling is her younger sister Gabrielle. Both seem to have inherited the blonde hair characteristic of veela, along with being abnormally beautiful and being able, to a much reduced degree, to influence the minds of any male individuals in their immediate vicinity.
- Fleur's mother, IIRC, is identified as being strikingly beautiful and likewise shares these characteristics.
- Cousins are mentioned, and while their gender is not IIRC explicitly identified, they are implied from the dialog and actions of other characters to likewise be female.

*Conclusions:*

- Fleur's */maternal grandmother/* is a full veela. Fleur's mother is thus half-veela, with Fleur herself being quarter-veela.
- The veela's ability to influence men is inherited, but with less potency in mixed-blood
- No male part-veela has been identified in canon.

Thus, it is entirely possible that veela abilities are passed down matrilineally, and it is conceivable that the offspring of human/veela unions could indeed be exclusively female.

*EDIT:* This actually brings to mind another question of mine, actually. Of the ones seen in the series, veela are exclusively female; no male veela is ever stated to appear. Which brings to my mind two possibilities:

- They do exist, but are not as prominent; perhaps they may lack their female counterpart's abilities, or have them to a much lesser extent. Sexual dimorphism does occur in real-world species in nature, and it is possible that some form of the same could be at play.
- They do not exist, and veela exclusively depend on procreating with humans in order to maintain their numbers. This would be in line with your hypothesis that the offspring of these unions are exclusively female and are always veela, and as such do eventually exhibit the abilities shown by veela at the World Cup - perhaps once they reach adulthood.
