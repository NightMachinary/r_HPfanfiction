I think that what you're saying is pretty much how it works in canon!

However, what I said is /not/ how it works in canon. The Asari are an alien race in Mass Effect who are exclusively female, although they can mate with each other as well as other races. When they mate with other races, however, the kids are not 'half-Asari' they're full Asari with some traits - mostly personality-wise - from the 'father' (who can be a female alien, but the Asari is always the one who bears the children).

They also live for a thousand years or so and mating within their species is very much discouraged because there's a mutation that creates Asari who kill their mates when mating, which happens only when Asari breed with other Asari.

Basically the Asari are awesome and it would be BRILLIANT if the Veela were like that.
