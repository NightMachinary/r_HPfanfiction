In mythology, the Vila are a kind of spirit which just exist. While the HP world generally takes mythological things and "normalises" them, the world does have plenty of creatures which basically "spawn" under certain conditions without any kind of biological reproduction - dementors, boggarts, etc. The Veela could be the same. Certainly they are noted to have a certain ethereal quality about them.
