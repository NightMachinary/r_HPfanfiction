  Avoid making Dementors irredeemably evil --- just say the ones in Azkaban are cranks.

That's a weird one. Dementors are the embodiment of depression: I'm not sure why we'd want that to be redeemable. Are you picturing them as sentient, intelligent beings? That's not the impression I get at all. I'd see them as more like fairies and doxies than goblins and house elves.
