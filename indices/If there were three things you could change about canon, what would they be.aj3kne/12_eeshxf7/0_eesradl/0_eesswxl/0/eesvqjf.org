They are certainly intelligent, but whether this renders them sapient (i.e. capable of exercising true independent judgement/decisions) in the HP world is up for grabs. The HP world is dualist - it is your soul, not your mind, which is your true self, your essence.

Magic seems to be able to gift things with intelligence quite easily, but it's not really full sapience - these magically intelligent things, while they have general intelligence in the sense of passing the Turing test, are generally constrained in some way. They do not exhibit independent judgement like a person has.

The Sorting Hat, for instance, is clearly intelligent but at the same time its intelligence exists for a function - Sorting. For the rest of the year that intelligence is content to sit on a shelf and do nothing. It's not sitting there wishing it could be free. Its general intelligence is directed entirely towards the performance of a single task.

Similarly with portraits, they have intelligence but it's a kind of constrained intelligence. Sir Cadogan is a good example: clearly he can interact with people, but at the same time he's a kind of caricature of the real Sir Cadogan - the portrait is locked into certain over the top behaviours, incapable of introspection or change, like a person stuck on repeat.

With dementors, it seems clear to me that they are intelligent but also constrained by their nature. A dementor could no more choose to do good than a person can choose to fly.
