I disagree with you, Taure. Isn't a Dementor "doing good" by guarding a prison, feeding them, burying the dead? That's all doing good. Bringing captive people food, is a good deed. Keeping prisoners contained is a good deed. Burying the dead isn't just good, it's also showing respect for the dead. Their nature doesn't dictate if they can do "good" or not, I disagree. Otherwise don't you think they'd just freeze up or start spasming all the time because they're already doing good? They have free will, they can think and reason and choose to do what they want. If someone taught them morals, gave them punishment or reward they could certainly do good.

I don't think of them as "constrained" by some innate thing, like a programming block or something. I think it's more like URGES and INSTINCTS. Like sadists and serial killers. They have urges to harm, to kill, and in the Dementor's case to sap emotions and take souls, but they can resist those urges if they want to.

They do, in canon, otherwise wouldn't all of Azkaban be full of empty husks? Wouldn't they swoop onto the first Ministry worker that they have to be around? But they don't. And when they got ORDERED after harry by umbridge they certainly didn't just go nuts and have a feast on the entirety of little whinging! They CHOSE to not go attacking everyone in sight, and chose to solely focus on finding Harry. That's instinct, resisted, by CHOICE, not some programming constraint that hard locks them or whatever you say about it.
