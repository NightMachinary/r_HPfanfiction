According to pottermore, the dementors existed in Azkaban long before the prison did. When the ministry found them, they decided to turn it into a prison and make the dementors the guards, instead of displacing the dementors and loosing them on mainland Britain. It's a win-win for both parties: the wizards get free guards, and the dementors get fresh prey to feast on. The “good” they do is just simply part of their day to day tasks in that role.

Dementors control the Azkaban prisoners by constantly sapping the happiness out of the prisoners. That's what makes them so effective at the job. As Hagrid said in prisoner, “they don't need walls to keep you in.”
