Dementors ARE sapient, intelligent beings.

From canon itself, they can actually TALK, they can convey exact words and information from what Sirius was muttering in Azkaban.

  "The guards told Fudge that Black's been talking in his sleep for a while now. Always the same words: â€˜He's at Hogwarts...he's at Hogwarts.' Black is deranged, Molly, and he wants Harry dead."

They were said to bring food to prisoners.

  "It was as if someone had lit a fire in my head, and the Dementors couldn't destroy it ...it wasn't a happy feeling...it was an obsession...but it gave me strength, it cleared my mind. So, one night when they opened my door to bring food, I slipped past them as a dog and they bury people who die."

They bury the dead.

  "Crouch never came for his son's body. The dementors buried him outside the fortress; I watched them do it." Sirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his mouth and instead picked up the flask of pumpkin juice and drained it.

They have always been canonically sapient, intelligent beings in their own right. You are wrong for seeing them as nonsapient or unintelligent beings. That view of them is all fanon, clearly not canon. Canon is the opposite, and it's very clear.
