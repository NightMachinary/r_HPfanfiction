Weeell, they never said that Pettigrew was /stupid/ per se, just that he was a coward who gravitated towards friends more talented than him, and that he had very little in the way of actual magical abilities.

And honestly hiding out as a rat IMO doesn't require intelligence so much as a great deal of patience and very low standards.
