Zacharias always seemed to be the biggest jerk-wad from Hufflepuff, in Harry's year; I think he even ran away and didn't fight in the final battle; that's the closest to a "evil Hufflepuff" that we have, I think. I wouldn't mind more variety and versions as well.

I mean we have a coward in Pettigrew who is evil and betrayed Lily and James Potter, who sent Sirius to Azkaban, who killed twelve Muggles. We have a Regulus who found out that Voldemort had a Horcrux and decided to try and destroy it, labeling him more neutral, we definitely need more evil to neutral characters in other characters.

Thinking about Pettigrew, I want a better written Pettigrew, he was a complete and utter coward; and yet we're suppose to believe he followed a plan like betraying Lily and James without any suspicion? He killed twelve muggles and was able to stay "dead" for years with Sirius in Azkaban? That just seems way too smart for canon Pettigrew to pull off.
