1. Good /and/ evil characters from /all four houses/, preferably at least one fleshed out one for each (yes, even indisputably good Slytherins and evil Hufflepuffs). The unequal distribution of good and evil characters across the houses, even when you factor in the biases stemming from having Harry as the main character through whose eyes we see the world, has always bothered me. Start the series with a black and white, Gryffindor vs Slytherin world view, and gradually demonstrate through the characters we meet that the quality of /all four houses/ can be used for good /or/ evil, and that it's our choices that matter. And by Merlin, at least one Slytherin in DA please!

2. Either better character development and a bigger role for Ginny plus the complete overhaul of the H/G romantic subplot, or no endgame pairing for Harry at all. (And before you say "just have him end up with Hermione instead," I prefer them to be friends/pseudo-siblings, as one of the rare examples of a completely platonic relationship between a male protagonist and a well-written female main character).

3. Make a choice between horcruxes and deathly hallows as the key to Voldemort's defeat and the center of Harry & Co.'s quest, and stick to it.
