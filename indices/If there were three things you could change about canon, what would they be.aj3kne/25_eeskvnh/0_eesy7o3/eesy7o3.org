This is really the crux of why the books got frustrating for me: in books one through three Harry is an absolute Hero.

Book four is his low point: he sees a friend murdered in front of him, and sees just how out of his depth he is in comparison to a resurrected Voldemort.

Book five he fails again, and it's much more his own fault than anything that's come before...which is ok, I guess. Little bit angsty but he's a teenager, so fair enough. The extended low point should serve as extra motivation, right?

Books six and seven see him transform from proactive hero into passive martyr. It's not at all satisfying.
