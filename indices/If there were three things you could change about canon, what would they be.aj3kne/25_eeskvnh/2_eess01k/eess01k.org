That's a pretty good point in book 4 - Harry studying the summoning charm for the first task. It isn't magic that's above his level, or even being studied later in the year - it's something he's already expected to know and that other students have already mastered in the classroom. I don't know what he was teaching sometimes, because Harry's spellwork was apparently below average.
