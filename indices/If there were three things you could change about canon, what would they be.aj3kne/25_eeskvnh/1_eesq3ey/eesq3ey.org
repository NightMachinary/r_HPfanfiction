If I were to write Ron in DH, I would have removed the worthless concept of him abandoning the tent and instead brought back the strategic side of him that was dropped after the first book. Have him be the one who hastily plans how to escape from situations like Malfoy Manor or how to go about attacking a group of Death Eaters. Deathly Hallows was definitely the book where Ron fell the hardest on his face imo.

I don't think he needs an epic death to redeem himself, that just seems cheap. What I think would have been a great moment for him is if he was the one who saved Lavender from Fenrir. The moment he sees her in danger, he blasts Fenrir out of the sky and then makes it his responsibility to take care of her, making up for how inconsiderate he was of her feelings the year prior. This would also foreshadow them getting married later down the line.
