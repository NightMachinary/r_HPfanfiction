But we have no indication that he is actually a strategist. He is good at chess, which is very far from battlefield tactics, especially on a squad level. It might serve as an analogy for a Great War General who sends his troops into no-man's land without a second thought other than gaining a mile, but not for "we need an escape plan now".

I mean, Chess is still a game. I ranked out at the global #62 spot in Ski Jumping (Vancouver Olympics game back in 2010), and yet I have never even worn skis. I am decent at realistic RTS games, yet utterly unqualified to command troops in battle. And the Wargame series is a lot closer to reality than Chess.
