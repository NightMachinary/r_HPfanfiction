Tactics and strategy are very different things. Ron being so good at chess speaks to his tactical ability. How sharp his mind is and how easily he can change up his game plan. His dueling style is also unconventional, as seen in OotP, and there are several ways to utilize this, just as Hermione is resourceful with her environment and using non-combat spells. He's very smart, in a practical sense, and quick-witted, in both dialogue and situational awareness.

But that being said, Ron isn't much of a strategist, as he's terrible at planning and thinking ahead. That's more Hermione's thing, whereas she cracks under pressure. I wish these aspects of their personality were utilized more, but Hermione does start to think more clearly under pressure, seen when Ron got splinched, and Ron does start to show signs of perspicacity when he starts leading the group after his return. He's also got good business sense, according to JK.
