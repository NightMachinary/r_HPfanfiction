1. Harry/Hermione should be the pairing.

2. I've said this before in a different post, but either give Ron something worthwhile to redeem himself or give him an epic heroic death at the end. He ended up as a mediocre character who was not on the same level as Hermione or Harry.

3. A little more competence from Harry. Not saying he should've done a power training montage that ends up as Super Harry, but as he says himself most of the stuff he's done in canon was through luck and not so much magical ability. There are too few grand magical feats from him, in 7 books only the Patronus was truly exceptional in power. With him learning the Patronus in book 3, learning a lot of (basic) magic in book 4 and doing the DA in book 5 it boggles the mind that he just sits on his ass after that. He even has the ambition to become an auror and does no sort of studying.
