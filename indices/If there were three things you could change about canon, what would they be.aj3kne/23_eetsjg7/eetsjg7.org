Ginny's actually ostracized, bullied and mocked post-book 2. people found out what happened in regards to the Chamber of Secrets, discovered that Ginny was involved. however, they reach the wrong conclusion. that she's a future-death eater just biding her time so she can rejoin her "master". this leads to Ginny developing a massive anti-social complex, so she's not interested in having friends and is not social at all. this also means she doesn't mock or bully others herself the way she did in Canon. only her family and a few other people actually believe her. so when Harry actually approaches her to check that Ginny's alright, she becomes suspicious and remains so for quite a while.
