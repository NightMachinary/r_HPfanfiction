In general terms, these are the three main things I would change in terms of the story overall.

*/1. Either ditch or completely rewrite the Epilogue./* Most importantly, /change the name of Harry's second son/, even assuming I keep that part of it at all...which is not likely.

*/2. Severely overhaul the relationships angle for most of the paired characters./* Harry/Ginny is severely underdeveloped, Lavender/Ron is a completely unnecessary Romantic Plot Tumor, Harry/Cho is badly mishandled and borders on RPT as well.

*/3. Drastically alter the inter-House dynamic./* As it is, Gryffindor is The Good Guy House, Slytherin is The Bad Guy House, Ravenclaw is The Nerd House - and even that's an informed ability, since there's no Ravenclaw ever actually shown to be substantially /equal/ to Hermione, much less superior. And Hufflepuff is The Sort-of-there-but-basically-irrelevant House in five of six books that are set at Hogwarts. One idea I had was to have the main characters be students from different Houses, rather than lumping all of them together into Gryffindor.
