1. Write from different characters' perspectives. So much was missed from having the entire series from Harry's perspective.

2. Rewrite HBP. Ron and Hermione tripping over themselves was relatively pointless and did both of them a disservice. Harry's attraction to Ginny was poorly executed. Not enough overall story progression.

3. Change the overall world building. I'd delve deeper into lore and magic, make the Death Eaters actual threats, and spend more time showcasing how exception our protagonists are, which was hardly ever utilized.
