The ending. I'm sorry, but I really think Harry should have died /for real/ and not had the option to come back to life again. I think that was a cop-our from Rowling.

Characters in other similar themed works have to sacrifice something important to defeat evil - Frodo never recovers mentally and has to leave Middle Earth for good, Luke Skywalker loses his hand /and/ his dad, etc. It never feels to me that Harry makes a choice and faces a consequence for it other than his mistake in OotP with Sirius, which isn't quite the same thing.
