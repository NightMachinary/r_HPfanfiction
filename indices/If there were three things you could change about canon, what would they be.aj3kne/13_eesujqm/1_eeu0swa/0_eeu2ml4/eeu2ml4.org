I don't agree. The first few were kids books 100%, but the later ones read much more like YA. The romance didn't suck because it's a kids book, it sucked because she didn't write it well. I love JKR and her writing for most of the series, but the romance, maths, and ending were comparatively poor.

I feel a bit like once GoF and the huge Pottermania boom happened, her editors stopped editing as harshly, and parts suffered for that.
