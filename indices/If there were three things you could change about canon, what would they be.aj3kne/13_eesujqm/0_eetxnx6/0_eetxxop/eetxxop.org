All Harry's real loss and suffering (bar Sirius) was before the books even started - his parents and then living with the Dursleys. And Frodo and Luke both grew up without parents too. So I'm afraid I don't really buy that we saw any especial suffering from Harry for his victory.

If I was re-writing the ending, I would have Harry choose to die as he did, but is then faced with the choice of passing on to see his family or staying as a ghost to finish of Voldemort. He sees something through his link with Voldemort just as he dies that is the key to killing him, so Harry chooses to be parted from his parents forever and returns as a ghost to tell Neville how to kill Voldemort. So that the prophecy then swings both ways. Epilogue would then be Harry, as the vital key to defeating Voldemort and in recognition of his sacrifice, gets taken once more to the department of mysteries and asked if he wants to try going through the veil, which he does.
