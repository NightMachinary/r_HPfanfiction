Okay. But he lost Dumbledore too. He had to witness Cedric dying from close range. He had to actually kill a guy in his first year as an eleven year old, even though it was in self defense. My point is he had to endure horrors (and abuse - it didn't really stop during the series, did it?) that most kids in fantasy don't have too.

I get your point, but Harry's character isn't without its set of trauma. And Luke isn't really comparable, because he was practically an adult when the series started
