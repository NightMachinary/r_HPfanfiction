He lost Dumbledore, but pretty much every coming-of-age hero loses their mentor (and usually to death). That's a trope of fantasy. Luke lost Obi Wan, Frodo lost Gandalf (and didn't realise he'd reappeared til the end).

If you'd rather compare him to a kid in classic fantasy, see the Belgariad or an equivalent - child brought up, usually without parents, gets forced into an adventure they don't really want, realise they can't go home, see a lot of death and destruction along the way, end up having to take up responsibility and then life changes irrevocably for them if they survive. Harry ticked all the usual boxes except for his win - he didn't sacrifice anything for his defeat of the dark lord, and the epilogue is so sickening because it hammers home that life carried on as if Voldemort had never risen again.

Harry's life is no bed of roses, absolutely. But compared to other fantasy heroes with a similar arc, he gets away pretty easily with his victory and hence why it feels very anticlimactic and hollow to me personally.
