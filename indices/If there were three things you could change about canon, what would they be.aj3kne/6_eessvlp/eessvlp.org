Oooh good topic! And appropriate to put it here rather than [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]]

1. 100% agree with you about Harry/Ginny. Either scrap it for another pairing or develop it better.
2. Don't make Ginny such a transparent overlay of "she's Cho Chang, only better!" This kind of goes hand it hand with point one though, about developing Ginny's character earlier and better, so that she doesn't careen in as the perfectly placed love interest at just the right moment.
3. Don't make the final decision for Voldemort living or dying rest on Harry pulling some wands out of Draco's hands one time. Maybe let it be something more significant than overly complicated wand lore that didn't come up at all until DH.
