I would change more or less everything: 1 Create a consistent magic system with rules and an explanation for those rules, explain how magic works. 2 Make Harry powerful and create distinct power levels, for example make Voldemort and Harry more powerful than Dumbledore, it would explain why Harry is actually the only one who can defeat Voldemort 3 Make Dumbledore and Voldemort competent 4 Scrap the Dursley, I never understood why Harry after facing the most powerful Dark Wizard alive would go back to be abused by muggles 5 Take the series out of Hogwarts by the time book five or six rolls around 6 Give the Hallows an actual meaning for example the wand should give you the knowledge of all its previous owner, the stone should let you control the dead, the cloak should give you absolute stealth it makes no sense to me that Moody could see through it also make them much harder to gain and don't give them all to the same person 7 Either give Snape and Malfoy an actual redemption arc or kill them off
