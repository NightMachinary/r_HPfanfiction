The students should have been more friendly among houses as well as have more friendly Slytherins and/or more neutral to bad people in the other three houses. I really like how HP fanfiction and the Hogwarts Mystery game has you easily make friends across the houses, no matter what house the MC is in.

Honestly, making the Raven the mascot for Ravenclaw and the blue and silver colors look way better as well, I thought. I'm glad they changed that detail in the movies and that the merchandise is ravens. It just fits for intelligence too in mythology/fantasy, since ravens/crows talk often in stories and they are the pets of Odin, the god of wisdom in Norse mythology.

Also, I agree that the epilogue should not have been added, especially with all the kids names being cringe-inducing to me. It was corny and I was happy with the last chapter having an open-ending.
