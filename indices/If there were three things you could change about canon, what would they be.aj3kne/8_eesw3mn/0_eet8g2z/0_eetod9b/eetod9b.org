I understand the deaths of basically every other character in the story from a plot standpoint. Sirius and Dumbledore were never going to stand aside at let Harry face Voldemort, those two had to die to give have that opportunity. Tonks and Remus died to create a parallel between Harry and Teddy. I can even see it with Fred who made a conscious decision to fight in a war. But Dobby, all Dobby wanted to do was protect his friend Harry Potter.
