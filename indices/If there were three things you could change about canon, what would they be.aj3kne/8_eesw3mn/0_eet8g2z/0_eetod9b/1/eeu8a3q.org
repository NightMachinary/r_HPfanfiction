Honestly Fred was for me the worst one. Why not Percy? The son that finally joined the fight, finally stood with his family and then gets ripped away so soon after reconciliating with his family... it would have made just as much sense as Fred. Rly jkr just killed Fred for the shock value and the "war doesn't care who you are" thing (because they where twins).

Or Ron, would have worked too (and Ron was one of my faves)
