That's what realistically would have happened, but if JKR wrote Harry in the Epilogue married to his former Auror partner Jane, a Ravenclaw 3 years younger/older than him, everybody woud go "Huh?" and bitch about introducing a new love interest out of the blue in the last chapter.

There's no winning with this one.
