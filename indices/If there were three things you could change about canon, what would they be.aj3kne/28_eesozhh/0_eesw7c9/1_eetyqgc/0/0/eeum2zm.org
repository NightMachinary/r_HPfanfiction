I think they could have still done a Hogwarts Express epilogue either on September 1 or at the end of the next school year. Play catch up with Harry, Ron, Hermione, Luna, Neville, and Ginny. (I mean, even if the boys aren't going back to Hogwarts, the girls would have, maybe they are dropping them off or picking them up.) Give an idea of where they are all going, hint at pairings if you must, but without the children and the sad midlife doldrums they settled into.
