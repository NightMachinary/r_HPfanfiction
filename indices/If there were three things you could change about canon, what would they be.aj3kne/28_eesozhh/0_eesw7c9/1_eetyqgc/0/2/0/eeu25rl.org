Idk if I agree with the Malfoy thing tbh, I think he was a child and got put in a goddamn hard spot. As far as I can tell the worst thing he did was letting the death eaters get into Hogwarts in HBP and that was under threat. He was terrified. I doubt Azkaban would be the right option for him. Instead, I think someone like him might benefit from some sort of mandatory giving back to society and muggle studies program or something like that.
