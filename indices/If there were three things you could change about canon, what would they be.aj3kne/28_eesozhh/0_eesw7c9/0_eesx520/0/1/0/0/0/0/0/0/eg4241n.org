Most of Mao's victims starved due to his insane attempts at modernizing the country. There was at least some twisted logic behind them. Destroying your capital, in the hope that you may destroy some wizards, who could teleport wherever they want? Not really.

As for the barrier troops, since when does detained means shot? In the vast majority of cases, they were stopped and forced back. If you look at the Russian original, this is even more clear:

#+begin_quote
  Из числа задержанных, арестовано 25 878 человек, остальные 632 486 человек сформированы в части и вновь направлены на фронт.
#+end_quote

Which translates to:

#+begin_quote
  From the detained, 25,878 were arrested, the other 632,486 were formed into units and sent back to the front.
#+end_quote

Of course, many of those shot probably did not undergo trials, but it's far from claiming that most were shot.
