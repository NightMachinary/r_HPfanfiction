You imagine that they would practice the same type of secrecy as practiced in Britain, rather than simply discontinuing taking in Muggleborns (which Durmstrang doesn't for example) or take more serious secrecy measures.

Also even Mao wouldn't destroy his own capital to catch a few wizards. There is ruthlessness and there is sheer stupidity. There is of course also the point that he would not live long if he attempted to openly hunt for wizards. It's not as if he could defend himself against being assassinated by wizards.

And off topic, but the barrier troops sole (or even main) purpose certainly wasn't to gun down fleeing soldiers. This might have happened with penal troops, but in the vast majority of cases their aim was to force retreating troops to return to the front, which was more useful than shooting them.
