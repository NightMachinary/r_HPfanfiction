See, that's what I don't get. I've written a few romance oneshots, all of which got very good reviews, and I didn't have a single declaration of love in any of them. Evidently, people are happy to read such kind of story.

And yet for some reason 95% of all romantic stories have some rushed declarations of undying love before the first date is even over. The climax is coming together (heh), not the relationship. People keep transcribing romance movies or dramas like Romeo and Juliette, other people get inspired by that and write their own take, and so you get thousands of romances which are nowhere close to reality.
