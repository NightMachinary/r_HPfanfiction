Sirius getting a trial and being able to raise Harry, I'd love to see how a Harry who was loved from the beginning and knew about the Wizarding World would be. That in turn would change a lot of the actual plot points that came about, I feel.

That's the major plot point I'd change.

I'd also change Harry being a Horcrux, as I always thought that plot point was extreme.
