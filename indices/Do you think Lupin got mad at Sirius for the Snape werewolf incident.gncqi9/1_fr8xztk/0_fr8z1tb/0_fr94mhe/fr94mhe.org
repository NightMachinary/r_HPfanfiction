I would agree that "prank" is a little too lighthearted for what he did. It was more ok you bastard you want to find out what's going on then here you go let's see how you handle it.

If terms of Sirius' dislike/hate remember that at this time Sirius was cast out of his family for not following their pureblood beliefs and being aligned with Voldemort. You have the war heating up, you have the deatheater supporters at school, and you have Snape aligning himself with the deatheaters. You have Snape calling Lily a mudblood (I believe this happened before the Lupin incident) emotionally hurting Lily because a supposed friend turns against her.

And then add Sirius being very protective of James (because his parents "rescued" Sirius) and of Lily and you can easily see Sirius going overboard to "get" Snape who represents everything that Sirius is turning away from/rejecting.

Then add they are all hormone driven teenagers who rarely fully understand the potential consequences of their actions and you can see where things can go wrong.
