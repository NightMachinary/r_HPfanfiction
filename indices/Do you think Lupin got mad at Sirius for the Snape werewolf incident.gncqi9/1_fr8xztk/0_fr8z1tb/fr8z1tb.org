I know he says Prank but i really do wonder if it was really a prank for him. He does really intensely hate Snape I dont think its just a Marauders thing. Lupin for example doesn't seem to hate Snape that much even though Snape outed him as a werewolf which made it harder for him to find work after the anti werewolf bill passed. He should probably dislike Snape more than Sirius who has no real canon reason to hate him this much honestly
