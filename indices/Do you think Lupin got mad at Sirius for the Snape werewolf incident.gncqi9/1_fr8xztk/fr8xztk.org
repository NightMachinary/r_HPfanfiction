I think Lupin would still be mad at Sirius. First mainly because it would pretty much be guaranteed that at that timeframe Lupin would be executed for a werewolf attacking a student.

Two because Lupin hated being a werewolf because of being attacked as a child. So for him to attack another person and either kill that person or turn him would tear Lupin apart emotionally/mentally. And for this to happen because Sirius wanted to get back at Snape would be a betrayal.

Lupin would also see this attack as Lupin betraying Dumbledore's faith in him by allowing him to attend school even though he knew he was a werewolf. Basically meaning that no other werewolf child would ever get the opportunity (of course, this begs the question why was no other child who was attacked by a werewolf given the opportunity to go to Hogwarts. Surely Lupin wasn't the only deserving child).

So bottom line I think Lupin would be very mad at Sirius for doing what he did. I think James would be mad as well knowing what might have happened to their friend if Sirius' "prank" had been successful.
