I imagine that killing someone, even someone as unpleasant as Snape, whilst transformed was one of Lupin's biggest fears, therefore he would almost certainly have been very upset at Sirius for essentially using him as a weapon to potentially kill someone.

I recall reading a theory that the event caused the two to fall out quite significantly and thus explained why Black was willing to believe that Lupin was a spy during the first war, and why Lupin was willing to believe that Black had betrayed the Potter's.
