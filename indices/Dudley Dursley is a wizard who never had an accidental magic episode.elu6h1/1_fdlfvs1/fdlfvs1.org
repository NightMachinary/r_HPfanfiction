I can imagine two ways to go with this prompt.

The easiest one is fairly similar to most "Dudley is a wizard" prompts in that he's never had any accidental magic incidents and doesn't know he's a wizard until he's 11. Most of these I've seen have his magic bound by Dumbledore at the request of the Dursleys when he was a baby. This Dudley usually turns on his Dursleyness and becomes very OOC immediately.

The other way would be to somehow rewrite/reinterpet the reception Hagrid gets in the shack as the Dursleys forbidding Dudley to go to Hogwarts, with the Hagrid reporting that back to Dumbledore without Harry or the Dursleys realizing what Dudley is. Canon proceeds until 5th year, when Harry realizes that Dudley can see the dementors.

Personally I've never had any interest in "X comes to Hogwarts late" stories so I would be more likely to pursue the first option with a canon characterization of Dudley.

I would envision lots of accidental magic from tantrums once he stops getting everything his way. I'd imagine he'd call everyone freaks a lot. He'd slowly warm up to magic over the years, probably have an interest in spells that allow him to be lazy like the summoning charm. The food at Hogwarts would be a big deal for him. Draco would probably bully him a lot for practically being a muggle. It would be interesting to play with the character development. Dudley obviously went through off screen development between being saved from dementors and abandoning privet drive. I think being around Harry in school might see those changes happening sooner or more deeply.
