  The best revenge is living well.

No it's not. That's not even /revenge/, let alone "the /best/ revenge". The only merit the entire phrase has is the notion that /they/ should suffer from your revenge, not you (or to put another way, your quality of life is more important than the vengee's quality of life or lack thereof).
