No you sign your name. Where i'm from the comma at the end of a letter represents a break. For example Thanks- meaning thank-you for taking the time to read this letter, Warryn- to represent who I am. Basically "Thanks for reading this, my name is Warryn". This is only in the end of written communication.

Thanks, Warryn.
