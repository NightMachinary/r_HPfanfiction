Sorry. Where I live, that is how you end any form of written communication. I've had this argument already, and decided it is probably a difference in culture. So again sorry, but this is how I learnt it, and I don't wish to change it. If I ever move to Britain or America, sure, but otherwise that's just how it is where I live.
