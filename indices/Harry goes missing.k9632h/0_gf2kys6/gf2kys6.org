A wide selection lol.

DrT - [[https://ficwad.com/story/120541][A Fist Full of Galleons]] and [[https://ficwad.com/story/81436][When Vernon Didn't Miss]] both qualify. They're on ficwad, however, so can't be linked. His stories tend to be Harmony and super!Harry and very old/full of things that are now cliche.

Harry Potter and the Irish Choice - Harry nopes out of Hogwarts during his first year and goes to an Irish school.

Pack - Do you like dinosaurs? This has dinosaurs. Jurassic Park crossover where the portkey at the end of the maze does a stupid and he stays gone for as long as possible.

Behind Blue Eyes - Romance. Harry runs off with a muggle girl.

Of a Linear Circle - Harry vanishes on his birthday in fifth year. Slash, and snape-isn't-actually-a-dick-itis. Good lord I hate Snape, but this fic still rocks.

Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbone - Adventure fic that goes into magical theory a lot. Don't remember what year he buggers off during, but it was a very unique fic and a good read.

Make a Wish - the cracky classic itself.

Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia - whether he 'goes back' is questionable, but it's an awesome gtfo fic.

A Place Apart - another gtfo fic... right before fourth year. In progress, updates sunday nights/monday morning depending on time zone.

Harry Potter and the Elder Sect - Absurd Bewitched crossover, lots of crack. Disappears Pre-Hogwarts.

The Denarian Renegade - Big series, Dresden Files crossover. Disappears Pre-Hogwarts.

Blood Doesn't Make Family - Supernatural crossover. Disappears Pre-Hogwarts. Warning: Not a happy ending.

The Secret Life of Epsilon Brown - Men in Black crossover. Disappears Pre-Hogwarts. Really good tbh.
