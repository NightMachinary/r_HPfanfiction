So? I know a woman who has two children, but has also had at least three miscarriages and has been unsuccessfully trying to even get pregnant again for years. Fertility is complicated, and there are more possibilities than just "you can't have kids," "you're lucky to have one kid," and "you can have as many kids as you want."

Maybe her parents wanted more kids, but were only able to have two. We don't actually know what the gap between Petunia and Lily's ages, so there could have even been several years of failing to get pregnant between their births.
