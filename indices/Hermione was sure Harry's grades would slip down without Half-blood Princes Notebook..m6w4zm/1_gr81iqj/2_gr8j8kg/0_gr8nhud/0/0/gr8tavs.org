You make a good point, but it's still not impossible. Maybe fertility issues run in her family. Maybe she was hit by a curse or was in some sort of magical accident that healers said would make it hard for her to get pregnant. Maybe a muggle doctor told her it would be difficult for her to get pregnant for some reason, so she looked for a magical solution.

Or maybe Lily just also wanted to "get lucky."

Or maybe they were into some really weird kinks, so they decided to take Felix Felicis beforehand to make sure no one got hurt.

But I guess those last two would make Harry probably an accident.
