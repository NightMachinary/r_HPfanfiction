If you take in consideration that Lily was only 19 when she got pregnant with Harry (only a little more than one year after she graduated from Hogwarts) I think we can rule out that they had trouble getting pregnant. I wouldn't be surprised if Harry was an accident.

Other than that, I love the idea of both of them taking Felix Felicis while conceiving Harry.
