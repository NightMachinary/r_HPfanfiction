Dumbledore's characterization in /Defiance/ is one of the best I've read. linkffn(12516323)

Tonks, Ron, Neville and Fleur in /Renegade/ are well-written, 'improved' versions of their canon counterparts. linkffn(11302568)

Harry's characterization in /The Merging/ is brilliant, especially because it doesn't fall too much into the 'angsty' or 'ridiculously independent' sides. linkffn(9720211)
