Yeah, I couldn't keep reading after their "marriage". I mean, "slow burn" but the first 5 minutes that they know each other, they get married ? wtf. Not to mention her being way too fucking op, and Xanxus' line of thoughts were so irritating, him thinking everyone as "trash" "slut" "scum" and such, I get that it should fit the canon, but it is annoying to read it over and over again.
