I can't thank you enough, I know exactly how you feel about the slash, its really hard in the Twilight-verse to find good non-slash with HP.

Of the PJxHP, I've read pretty much everyone you suggested except "The aftermath" and Serpents. And both seem quite interesting.

Chrysoclorous is hands down, my favourite crossover of Twilight, that I've read so far, but all of the other ones you've suggested, I've never seen, and I'm a huge fan of Jasper. One that I found to be quite hilarious is The Girl Who Imprinted, sadly, its abandoned...

I love Slowly, and Then All at Once, I've read the "spin-off" that najex wrote and is still writing from it first, because I didn't know about this one. Then I read and fell in love with it too. The spin-off is called By Courage and Love, if you want to know, if you haven't already, that is.

I also liked To train a Dragon Rider, but I kinda got a bit bored towards the end, until it showed the deeper lore that the author did, with the first dragon and whatnot (don't remember the name, the one that is rainbow coloroured) and was sad that it wwas abandoned too, or at least in massive hiatus. Its still in my fav list though, so here's hoping.

The last one from Eragon was one that I've seen in my searches, but never felt the impulse to read it, but considering that I'm a bit bored, I could give it a try.

Thanks again for the suggestions.
