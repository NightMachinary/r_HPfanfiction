I imagine it would be pretty hard to let go of a grudge against someone who had tried to kill you multiple times and who had created a future so bleak and desolate that you had to leave everyone you loved behind in order to attempt to stop the person. (I'm biased as hell though - I love Realignment) I love the request show, I love powerful Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Grindewald though I prefer Harry to be a touch less skilled than Dumbledore and Voldemort.
