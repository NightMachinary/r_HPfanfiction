Huh, my interpretation of the ending was that it was left up to the reader. An explanation for Harry's survival is that as master of death (and with Tom's soul piece in him still), Harry could survive a killing curse from Tom. An explanation of his death of course is that the Horcrux piece ceased to matter after Tom's resurrection and the master of death part cannot protect the master from death. I like to think Harry survived personally. He's definitely too blinded by hatred, though I think it's a reflection on Harry as a character as opposed to a reflection of the quality of the writing. He may abhor Tom but he is clearly driven by other things. There's still a bit of that "saving people thing" you can see. I think Harry's character works for the fic.
