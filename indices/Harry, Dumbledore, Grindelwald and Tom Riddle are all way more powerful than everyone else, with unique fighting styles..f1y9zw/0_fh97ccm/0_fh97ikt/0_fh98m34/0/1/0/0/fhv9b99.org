:END:

The ending has great similarities to 'a cadmean victory' and makes it easier to think up a happier ending. Though tbh the writer made no effort whatsoever to make us feel sympathetic towards Harry. Not that we feel sympathetic towards Tom either. Neither did he/she explore the character of Clara very much which made the impact of the ending far less heavy that what you get in a cadmean victory.
