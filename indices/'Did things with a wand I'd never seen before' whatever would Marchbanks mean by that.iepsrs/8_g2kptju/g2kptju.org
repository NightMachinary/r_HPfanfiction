I think a bit of both. For example, someone like Snape used peppermint in the Elixir of Euphoria to balance the side effects, a masterstroke that Slughorn found uncommon, so maybe something in that line.

I like to think that he did everything in record time and with precision. Conjuration, modification, and things of those variety. If we're looking at fanon for spellcasting then he could've done it with minimal wand movements as well (there's a fanon idea - which I also subscribe to - that wand movements are meant to be discarded, just like incantation, and this is the reason why adult wizards and witches cast spell with just a flick or a twitch of their wand). He could've also done distinct modification over his Transfiguration or Conjuration like changing an owl to a pair of glasses and adding a specific flowery pattern to the frame (this is all just my sloppy examples of course).

Another example - during his fight vs Voldemort, he enchanted the statues to become animated, resist spell (Voldemort's and Bellatrix's spells did nothing), take Harry as far away as possible, inform the Ministry Officials, all with just one wave of his wand. This is another fanon idea - which I like - that you can cast multiple Transfiguration or Charm spells at once on a body if you have certain control over spellcasting. Imagine casting the Piertotum Locomotor, Unbreakable Spell (it is an actual spell, Hermione uses it on the jar in which Rita Skeeter was captured), giving it some command and so on - casting at least three spells with just one wave. That was more than a century old Dumbledore, so maybe the younger Dumbledore also casted multiple spell (on a smaller scale of course) during his exams.

If he's able to cast multiple spells with no incantation, with minimal movement, and make subtle modifications over extreme subjects like a living being then that could catch people's eyes.

There's also spell creation, he could've created his own verson of Avis or Aguamenti or something similar to that to further show his control over Conjuration or any other branch of Transfiguration and Charm magic.

I know a lot of it ended up being rambling and fanon ideas, but hopefully this helped in giving some imagination to the particular event.
