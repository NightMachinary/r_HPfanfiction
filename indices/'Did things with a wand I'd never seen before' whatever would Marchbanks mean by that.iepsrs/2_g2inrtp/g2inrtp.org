I imagine a combination of both - a grasp of difficult, old or unusual magic and at the very least some tweaks on a few spells. Maybe some more efficient ways of doing things, or perhaps simply the speed of transfiguration (Harry spent some time adjusting his transfigurations).

I imagine some of the new spells are run of the mill by Harry's time, others perhaps used by professionals or even outdated. Others, probably only the likes of Dumbledore, Grindelwald and Voldemort can cast.
