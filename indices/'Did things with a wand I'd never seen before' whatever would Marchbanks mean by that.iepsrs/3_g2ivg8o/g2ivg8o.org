I always took at as within the context of the exams. 15 year old Dumbledore walks in and performs transfiguration on the level of a transfiguration master. Marchbanks never saw a student do something like that before. Unless the exams were different in Dumbledores time, he wouldn't really be able to do something different than the other students. After all they are told what magic to perform. It's only because the examiner was curious about Harry being able to de a patronus that he was told to do that. As far as I know there was no freestyle section.
