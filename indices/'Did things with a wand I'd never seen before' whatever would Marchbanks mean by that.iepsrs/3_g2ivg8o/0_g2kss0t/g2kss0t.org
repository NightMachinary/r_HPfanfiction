True, but I guess there are ways you can still showboat while doing the tasks asked of you.

Say, the exam is to turn an owl into a pair of opera glasses (I think that was Harry's exam task) - you could go for a very fancy, fine, maybe silver pair of glasses, or glasses that also have a telescopic vision charm on them, or some such. They could be richly detailed with filigree or whatever.

I think an imaginative Dumbledore would find a chance to be a show-off regardless of the task set in the exam.
