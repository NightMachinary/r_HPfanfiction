I always took that to be on the tests. As in she'd never seen someone display that level of skill on the exams before or after Dumbledore. Not sure he could really showcase totally new magic in 15 minutes. Even Harry was promoted to perform the patronus charm.

The real question here is how old is Madam Marchbanks??? It seems like an examiner would need to be reasonably experienced to start with and Dumbledore sat his exams a veeery long time ago.
