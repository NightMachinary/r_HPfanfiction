This is how I like Dumbledore depicted in fanfiction. Just effortlessly doing magic that most adults struggle with in conjunction with other things.

I like when Dumbledore misdirects, as well. He uses magic like a /magician/, not just a wizard, so while he's talking to you, he's doing magic. While his familiar is exploding into a younger self, he's doing magic. While he's fishing for some random object he lost in one of his pockets, he's doing magic. It all seems so seamless because he's lining everything up in the most efficient way to make it seem like he's this savant. Having the Elder Wand probably helps as well.
