What do you mean by "total inbreeding"? Do you mean "no consanguineous marriages ever" (commonly defined as no first cousins or anyone more related than that marrying)?

Or do you mean that occasionally consanguinity may occur (say, first cousin marriage), but never at a high enough frequency to cause inbreeding depression (lowered fertility, infertility, and more genetic diseases)?
