Absolutely not. The theory that after the Toba supervolcano humanity was "bottlenecked" to 30-10,000 individuals, while debunked now, was not ignored because of biological impossibilities. 200,000 is an insane number

Furthermore, /"A 2005 study from Rutgers University theorized that the pre-1492 native populations of the Americas are the descendants of only 70 individuals who crossed the land bridge between Asia and North America."/

Another theory suggests population numbers in Sub-Saharan Africa was as low as 2,000 at one point. And as mentioned above, Tristan de Cuhna had 15 original people, and only suffer relatively minor degenerations due to inbreeding.
