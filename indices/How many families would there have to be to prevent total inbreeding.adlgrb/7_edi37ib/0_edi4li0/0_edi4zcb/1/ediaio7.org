Effective population is considered about 3100 humans of breeding age.

This is assuming those people are left to their own devices. With strict controls on over who those people are allowed to have children with, a smaller number could be viable.

And even a far smaller number could make a comeback for the human race, but then there would be quite a few problems from inbreeding before it would work itself out. (assuming those inbreeding problems aren't too habsburgian)
