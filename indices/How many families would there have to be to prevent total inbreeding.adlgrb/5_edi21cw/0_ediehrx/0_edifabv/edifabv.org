Yeah, but we know there are basically no true Purebloods left in the Wizarding World. There doesn't need to be more than 28 families for the Wizarding World to make sense, because nobody is /actually/ trying to maintain a breeding population out of the 28, they just kind of whistle and pretend that they are.
