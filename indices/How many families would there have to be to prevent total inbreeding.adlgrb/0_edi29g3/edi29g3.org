28 families is sufficient.

15 individuals, 8 males and 7 females are certainly enough to create a sustainable population, capable of growth without any out-breeding, albeit with some genetic diseases due to in-breeding.

The reason we know this is because of a small island on the Atlantic Ocean, Tristan da Cuhna, which has a robust, growing population of 266 (May 2016), and have been inhabited for about 200 years. All people living on the island can derive themselves from 15 individuals, 8 males and 7 females. The population is a textbook example taught in genetics courses.
