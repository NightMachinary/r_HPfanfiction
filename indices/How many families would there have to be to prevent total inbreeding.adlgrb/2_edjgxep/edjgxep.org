The 28 Sacred Families thing is a book that was written by a Nott. It contains only the families that he considered to be not only pure enough but of good standing in society. There is no evidence in canon that purebloods are limited to marrying people from those same 28 families. The Black Family does seem to try and keep things British, pureblood, and to marry people of good standing in the British Society, but there's no rule that other families can't marry foreign wizards and witches or that you can't select a family that hasn't been “pureblood” for that long. Keep in mind that the Shacklebolt, Abbotts, and Longbottoms are in that list and they hardly strike me as the kind if families that would want to do inbreeding for the sake of purity. Even the Black family doesn't really take things that far. We know that Bellatrix's grandmother was a Crabbe and that Dorea Black married a Potter, and neither the Crabbe Family nor the Potter Family is in the Sacred 28 list.
