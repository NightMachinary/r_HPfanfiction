By my understanding, it is extremely dependant on number of generations.

For example, you could probably have children with a first cousin and the child will come out perfectly healthy. Repeat that over many generations and you get the health defects of inbreeding.

Considering multiple children in a family so marriages between a family and multiple other families, by the second generation of children there could be a shared ancestor (if one family had 15 children and those children married into entirely different families who had only a single child each), and can take up to 5 generations before a married couple has a common ancestor (each pair has only a single child and the child never marries if there is a common ancestor)

Tldr; it depends on number of children and number of generations.
