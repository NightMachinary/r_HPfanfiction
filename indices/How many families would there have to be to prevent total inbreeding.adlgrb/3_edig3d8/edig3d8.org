Ummm... is this specific to the British Magical community? Because there are way more than 28 families - there are 40 or 42 first year students in 1991, one set of twins and only a handful of them are muggleborns. Even if 30% of families decided the middle of a civil war (1980) was the perfect time to have a kid, that still would mean there would have had to have been some 100 families. Beyond that, the 28 families is a list made up by an anti-muggle blood supremacist who pretty much only included families he was closely related to or was friends with.
