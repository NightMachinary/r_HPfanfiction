Umm...Kinda? Maybe. Yes. Unfortunately. This one is going to definitely get me a few rss tags.

[[http://www.skyehawke.com/archive/story.php?no=2336][Here]]. I believe this is a midquel between two different fics, I just can't remember which ones. It's been 8 years since I read this, but the author always stuck in my mind for being persistent if nothing else. I believe the last fic in this series is like 200k+ words long.
