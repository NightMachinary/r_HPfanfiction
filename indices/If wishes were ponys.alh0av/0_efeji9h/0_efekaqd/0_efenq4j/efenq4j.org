Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11500936/1/Long-Live-The-Queen]]) Was the fanfic that I read to scratch my Harry Potter muggle/magical politics itch because /If Wishes were Ponies/ wasn't updating fast enough for me.

I very much enjoyed [[https://canoncansodoff.fanficauthors.net/Muggle_Summer_Wizards_Fall/index/][Muggle Summer, Wizard's Fall]], it gives me the same vibe as some of the Embassy chapters.
