It's a school match. The school wouldn't be able to afford to do that and we see that the school brooms are really bad. Oliver Wood panicked when he thought Harry might have to play on one in a match. But as we see in canon, the broom clearly isn't everything, otherwise Slytherin would win every game. They don't. The Gryffindors have a more skilled team.
