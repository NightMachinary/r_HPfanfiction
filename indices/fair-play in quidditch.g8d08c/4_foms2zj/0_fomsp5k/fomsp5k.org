But that's what I'm talking about - they can choose whatever they want, which could be e.g. a specially commissioned new broom with all the best features that's not even available yet or maybe won't be at all.

In Hogwart's matches - how is it fair that one team has newest generation brooms while the other has brooms older than their grandparents? There should be a uniformity in my opinion.

I'm all for Harry being out there and crushing his opponents into the grass, but still.

Brooms are such a major, game-changing, so to say, in-game factor, is what I'm saying.
