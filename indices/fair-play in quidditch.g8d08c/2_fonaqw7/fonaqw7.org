A really interesting idea in a fic I recently read (can't remember the name) was that different quidditch positions require different strengths on a broom and that the idea of just buying the newest/fastest broom rather than the one best fit for your position is actually a hindrance. For example, seekers who have to fly super fast to catch the snitch benefit most from fast brooms, while keepers who need quick maneuverability don't.
