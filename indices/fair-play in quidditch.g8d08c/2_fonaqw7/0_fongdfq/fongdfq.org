This is an interesting idea, however from what I inferred from canon - the newer the broom, better the overall spectrum of utilities it has. If I remember correctly, Firebolt seemed to have both speed and maneuverability and more.

But this is definitely something to consider if one were to write a more Quidditch-focused story.
