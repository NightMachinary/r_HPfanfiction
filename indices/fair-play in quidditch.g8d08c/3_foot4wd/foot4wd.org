Dearest Mother and Father,

I hope this letter finds you well. I have an idea, which I hope you will agree is a good one. Today, a Gryffindor boy was taunting me, claiming that the credit for my apparent quidditch prowess was actually due to my high-quality broom (for which I thank you again.) I laughed at this suggestion, and challenged him to a one-on-one snitch snatch, using school brooms from the shed. I offered him first choice of course. He accepted. I then suffered an embarrassing defeat, as I was quite unused to the very poor quality of the school's brooms. I could barely steer it. I have an increased admiration for the students who can fly them at all.

After congratulating the Gryffindor for his victory and thanking him for the lesson, I sunk into a deeper level of embarrassment when I realized the repercussions. The pride I had formerly felt at the Slytherin team's victories was, I now realize, quite unearned. Slytherin, mainly containing students from the generally wealthy old wizarding families like ours, has a team with the best brooms in the school. The other houses, which accept students from less ambitious families, as well as muggleborns, have teams with much lower-quality brooms. Now that I think of it, I don't see why the school allows competitions between teams flying such mismatched brooms. The only fair competition would be on brooms of equal quality, so the only variable is the students' skill.

I feel that the school brooms need to be replaced with some of a quality as good as mine. There should be fourteen, so two teams can play a game. I believe there should be a rule that only the official school brooms may be used for games. They should be inspected before every game to ensure that they are evenly matched, and randomly assigned, so neither side has an unfair advantage. Could you suggest this at the next meeting of the Board of Governors?

Of course, paying for these brooms is the issue. Perhaps Grandmother could organize a fundraiser, as she did for the penmanship tutors for the muggleborn students. Or this may be too much to ask, but I believe our family could just buy them outright and donate them. They could then be known as the Riddle brooms, which would burnish our name, not that our name needs any help.

Please write back soon, telling me what you think of this idea. I assured the Gryffindor that my father would hear of this, so we are both eagerly awaiting your reply.

Sincerely, Your loving son, Tom Riddle III

His signature was ornamented with so many flourishes and swoops, even Tom thought it was ostentatious, but such extravagance was forgivable in a teenager.
