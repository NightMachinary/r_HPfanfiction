The standards and regulations for F1 cars are actually very tight, the teams cant really go creating the fastest possible designs because of the constraints. It's not a standardized car but they end up very similar. F1 isnt a great comparison either because all the teams that are in it are all fairly well funded. Just nitpicking a little there. But in terms of quidditch, it is very much like real life sports where it's not based solely on the individual. Barring genetics, 2 people from different economic backgrounds would have a very different time getting on in sports where the baseline cost to play is expensive like hockey or bobsleigh or something. You have to pay for equipment and then on top of that ice time/slide time?(whatever its called). The less well off person could maybe never even have a shot at trying it, even if with the same rich person support they could may well excel even more than the person who has access. Comparing that to low baseline cost sports like running or soccer, everyone has to work just as hard for what they are able to achieve, barring politics and nepotism of course. Once at higher levels though, sponsorships and the likes happen and the baseline for monetary support gets reestablished so if you make it that far on money alone, and arent good, you get dropped, because you have never had to work hard for something ever. It kinda makes me wonder if Harry would have had any success at higher levels of quidditch, sure at Hogwarts he worked hard and had success, but he did always have the best broom, so many people on his side. Once you get to higher levels every one has that, they are all using the very best gear. Which also makes me wonder about the quidditch league itself. Like how does it work, how is recruiting done? How long do people play on average before they retire? How big is the player pool in Britain? I feel like it would not be terribly hard to get into compared to soccer or some other large player pool sport. I cant be bothered to do the math on it but I'm making the non researched assumption that. Anyways sorry, I meant to just respond to your comment but ended up writing more than i thought i would
