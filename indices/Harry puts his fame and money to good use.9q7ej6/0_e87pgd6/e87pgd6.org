We don't know canon Harry wouldn't have made change with his fame. He was a bit busy during his school years and all we see of after the war is him dropping his kids off at school.

Cursed Child notwithstanding, I see no reason that canon Harry couldn't have done a LOT of things after taking down Voldemort.
