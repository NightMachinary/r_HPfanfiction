if we're talking competent!Lockhart, then the one-shot Battles with Basilisks is pretty good. It's an alternate ending to COS that asks "what if Lockhart actually WAS the competent warrior he pretended to be?"

The fun part here is that even if Lockhart IS genuinely smart and heroic here, he still SOMEHOW manages to be perfectly in-character. Also, Harry and Ron get a lot of funny snark.
