It's frustrating how rare this pairing is. There are a few good stories on fanfic.net and AO3 but not many new ones. I'm starting to believe the closest thing I'll get to the Remus/Narcissa dynamic I want is the Comoran Strike novels, where the hero is a brave, disabled war veteran who struggles to open his heart while hunting down evil-doers and the heroine is torn between becoming the kind of frightened girl who would marry a pathetic narcissist and the kind of absolute badass Helen McCory plays on Fearless. Except Comoran isn't nerdy enough for me and Robin doesn't have that special Helen McCory something.
