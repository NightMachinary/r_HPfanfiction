Oh is it that short? Sorry, I'm relatively new to fan fiction and I read a few that had pretty short chapters and I thought that was the norm.

I have a plotline in mind, but it might change due to circumstances. I've always been very intrigued by how American wizards might operate, so internally I've fleshed out a governing system. I'm not sure exactly what's happening with Arthur in the far out future-my main concern is that he's too similar to Harry and fundamentally passive, but sometimes you need a more passive character when fleshing out a world that's unfamiliar to the reader.

I'm mostly doing it as a mental exercise, it might become a Sunday afternoon tradition- it's been very fun to write to far.
