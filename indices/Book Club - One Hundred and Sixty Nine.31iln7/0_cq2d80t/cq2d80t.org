I truly did enjoy this fic (though it's not one of my all time favourites). It's light reading, for the most part, and definitely a bit of fun (as long as you're not completely allergic to cliche). It's got nearly sixty chapters, though, and I always find it hard to read fics with so many (no matter how short a chapter may or mayn't be)--perhaps I'm the only one, but I've always thought there was something to be said for concise story telling.

The characterization is a little spotty, so sometimes it feels as if something a character says hits the nail right on the head, but at other times their words seem foreign from their mouths. More than once something that was said made me laugh out loud (though I finished a week or so ago, so I don't quite recall what), and the I found the situation in which [[/spoiler][M15 think Hermione's working for the KGB]] quite amusing. It was a rather sudden twist and definitely brought my attention back to what was becoming a bit of a dry read.

The end of the fic, where it turns out that [[/spoiler][Hermione actually unintentionally abandoned her original reality and all her friends in order to go back and change the past]] bothered me a bit, though I'm not sure if that's because it seems like a cop-out, or just because it's personally disappointing to know that [[/spoiler][technically she didn't save anyone she'd wanted to at all, or improve the lives of her friends as she'd hoped.]] Hermione didn't have much of an emotional reaction to that, which seems entirely out of character for her (for pretty much /anyone/, actually).

Despite my slight disappointment at the end, it was certainly worth reading overall. If I hadn't read it before, I would currently be advising myself to give it a go.

/TL;DR: enjoyable, funny fic with relatively believable characterizations, but paced in a manner that might leave you giving up somewhere 'round the middle./
