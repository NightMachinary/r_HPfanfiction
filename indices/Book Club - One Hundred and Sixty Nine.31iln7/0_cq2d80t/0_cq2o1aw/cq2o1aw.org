  Hermione didn't have much of an emotional reaction to that, which seems entirely out of character for her (for pretty much anyone, actually).

That /really/ bothered me, too. I mean, that's a pretty heavy bit of knowledge for anyone, but Hermione is probably the last HP character who would just brush if off for a "happily ever after" ending. :/

Other than that, though, I really enjoyed the fic! The Marauders were well characterized and I liked how they portrayed Peter's betrayal of the Potters.
