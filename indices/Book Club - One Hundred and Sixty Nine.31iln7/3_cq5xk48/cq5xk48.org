Thoughts - this was really, really long. I'm 100% with [[/u/Hocus_Bogus]] in that I feel like this story would have really benefited from some severe editing down.

I was really frustrated with the end. [[/spoiler][Hermione jumping out of her own timeline, rather than going back in time]] and then having NO strong reaction to that? Really OOC. It seemed like the author liked the idea of that plot point, but not dealing with the mental/psychological ramifications that any normal person would experience.

I HATED [[/spoiler][the end where Dumbledore is killed by the Muggles in the van.]] I think it was a great plot point, but I reacted really viscerally to it, and I can totally understand the motivations of [[/spoiler][the group who want to police Muggles better due to the shockwaves Muggles ignorantly caused by killing one of the most powerful wizards alive. I don't often sympathize with extremist groups but damn did his death rub me the wrong way.]]

I really liked this author's Remus and [[/spoiler][his tea face]]. Super cute. (:
