The author of /169/ is pulling the story at the end of the month (from ff, not ao3) due to harassment both in reviews and messages, so for people who like to save stories, I recommend you do so.

Edit: taken from my Tumblr post forever ago on this story over I finished it...

  I just finished reading “one hundred and sixty nine.” I think it's probably one of my favorite things ever. Legitimate laughing at scenes the whole way through, close to tears at some parts, frustration followed by revelation at the end... This one is getting moved onto the actual kindle when I get around to charging it.

It has since been put on my kindle, this remains one of my absolute favorite ships, and it's a fun read.
