I tried so hard to finish this, but somewhere in the middle of the story, I couldn't do it anymore.

There wasn't anything in particular that turned me off. I'm not a big fan of the Sirius characterization in this story. It's the annoying redeemed romanticizer. It's a trope that I hate.

I'll try again to get through it so I can a better review
