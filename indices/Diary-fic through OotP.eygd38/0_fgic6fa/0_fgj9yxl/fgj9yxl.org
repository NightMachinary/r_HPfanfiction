Yes and no: yes, because the story part is entirely ready (and has been since 2014); and no because I keep polishing my English/adding a few details to each chapter before I post them. Since I know where I'm going with the whole thing, I don't see why I wouldn't finish it. I understand, though, if this isn't enough "guarantee" for you to start reading - I VERY often feel the same way about unfinished fics that had grown on me. Thanks for commenting anyway!
