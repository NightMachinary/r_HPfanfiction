I've only started posting it last May, when I dusted the whole concept off a bit. Normally, I update on every 12th and 21st - I've been off schedule lately, though, because I had the impression that no one was really waiting for those updates anyway.

If you're interested, I have another story which is a prequel to this one, with the same characters: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13036198/1/Gadding-with-Ghouls]] --> This one is complete, so it might give you an idea if you'd like to continue or not.
