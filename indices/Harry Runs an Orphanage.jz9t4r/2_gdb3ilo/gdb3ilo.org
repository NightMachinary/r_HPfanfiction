There are a couple fics where Harry is involved with starting an orphanage that have Daphne Greengrass as his love interest: "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13498575/1/Potter-and-Prejudice][Potter and Prejudice]]" (complete) and "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13022013/1/Novocaine][Novocaine]]" (in progress). Both involve a wealthy attempting to rebuild the wizarding world. I prefer Novocaine, though I like them both.
