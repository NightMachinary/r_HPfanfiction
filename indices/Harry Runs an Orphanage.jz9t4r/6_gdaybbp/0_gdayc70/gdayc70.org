  Have you been missing a time travel Tomarry where Harry and Tom are on somewhat equal footing? Where Tom is a plausible budding political leader? Where Harry can stand up to him and their relationship doesn't seem toxic? Where the surrounding events and characters don't go unnoticed? I have, so I gave writing one a try.“The war is over and the Wizarding Britain has been slowly rising from the ashes. Harry just wishes none of it ever happened -- what will he do when he's given a chance to change the past? Was Dumbledore right about “the power he knows not” after all?“
