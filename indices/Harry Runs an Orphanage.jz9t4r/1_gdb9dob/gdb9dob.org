There's Witches of Westfield, which is the only one I know that hasn't been recc'ed already. Not sure if I'd actually recommend it on quality, this is purely on it meeting your request. It does feel very much like a character-driven romance-focused TV show from the 90s though, so if you like that vibe you'll probably like this.
