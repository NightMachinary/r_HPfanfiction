Spoilers for linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent):

The Power He Knows Not in this is anti-magic, but not in the sense of reflecting magic back. Instead, Harry can negate spells, making them disappear without their effects happening. I've always loved this concept, because 1. It doesn't require a Deus Ex Machina to bring Harry on par with Voldemort magically - there's no believable way to do this in the canon time frame if they're both competing in traditional magic and 2. It's something that would legitimately terrify Voldemort. He's based his entire identity on magic and his skill in it - anyone who can invalidate that and turn him into a regular person would be his worst nightmare. I'm still bummed no one else has taken this concept and ran with it separately - Blindness by AngelaStarCat had something similar, with Harry being able to unravel spells, but it was just a side effect of his greater understanding of magic, as opposed to the main focus
