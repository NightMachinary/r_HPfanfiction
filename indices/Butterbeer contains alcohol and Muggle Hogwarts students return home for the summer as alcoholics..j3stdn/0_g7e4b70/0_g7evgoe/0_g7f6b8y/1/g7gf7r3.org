It means it is a small beer

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_beer]]

Small beers have very low alcohol content. Historically, they were drunk by all ages because water wasn't always safe. Fermented drinks were less likely to go bad than stored water.

Incidentally, this is also where the name comes from. A buttery is a place used to store alcohol during medieval times, such as weak beer.
