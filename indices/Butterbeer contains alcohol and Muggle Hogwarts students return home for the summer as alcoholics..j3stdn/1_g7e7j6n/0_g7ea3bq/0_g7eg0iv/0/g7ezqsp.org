Of course, every American girl is a supermodel, and all of them have perfect body, brilliant mind, and very friendly personality.

However, I have been truly shocked when I heard from my American friends, how many of them never tried alcohol, and how many of their parents are serious in offering alcohol even to your own children under twenty-one at home is a crime (which apparently it is ... I was in a dry state, so laws are probably slightly more strict, but still).

And yes, then I was also shocked by how many frat parties of firsties ended up with alcohol poisoning, including fatal ones.
