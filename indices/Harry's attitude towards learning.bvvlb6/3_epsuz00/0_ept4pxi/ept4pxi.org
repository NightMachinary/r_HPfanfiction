I mean, the real culprit here is Rowling, not Harry. Either she hadn't conceived of aurors until the fourth book, or she hadn't slipped it in as a world building detail until it was relevant. And then since the reader needs aurors explained to them when they're first mentioned she has one of her characters be ignorant so that they can solicit exposition. Probably it could've been slipped in via some other device, but the entire narrative being so closely tied to Harry's point of view limits the options.

Really, this is the reason behind a good number of characters holding the idiot ball in the series.
