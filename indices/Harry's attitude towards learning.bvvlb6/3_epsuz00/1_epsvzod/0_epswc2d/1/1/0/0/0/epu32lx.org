I don't think Aurors would be called in for the Troll. That sounds more like the Department of Magical Creatures or some such. I also think Aurors tend to be undersold as 'Wizard detectives' in fanfic, whereas what they are is a somewhat narrow and unpopular-in-times-of-peace division of the Wizarding police.
