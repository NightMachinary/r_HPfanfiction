Yes, this exactly. To be fair, I was reminded more by fanfiction that Aurors are not the only patrollers of the Wizarding World. I did pay enough attention, though, to remember from the books that Arthur Weasley is a departmental sub-head (if that is the proper way to phrase it) of Magical Law Enforcement. Frankly, I think that Arthur dying in book 5 would have been a huge boost for those trying to convince the rest that Voldemort was back. Of course, it would have also made people wonder why he was in DoMy territory in the first place, but he certainly should have been familiar with the area, if only due to his job. We hear of Fudge trying to lower the budget for Aurors, and it's billed as being an attempt to lower the budget for law enforcement in general. That wouldn't make sense, though, since Obliviators are also part of MLE, and would be more needed as the muggle population grew.
