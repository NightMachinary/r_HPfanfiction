I do agree with you, I guess I meant that they would've been called in to secure the area around and maybe figure out how it even did so. Our only real interaction with the DMLE are Aurors in the Order, so I always assumed that while they were 'the best', that was more along the lines of SWAT or HRT. Where they are normal LE/Agents until a situation that needs them comes along, and then they kit up.

The situation with Black was apparently bad enough that Dementors were stationed in Hogsmead(e?) and Hogwarts. So where were 'the best'?
