Thank you for this. It does help remove some of the ambiguity in the roles of Auror vs Hit Wizard. I didn't realize that the Hit Wizards were a part of Magical Law Enforcement Patrol (or even that such a department existed) until you mentioned it.

Out of curiosity, which book and chapter was the second passage from? The one mentioning the regurgitating toilet.
