  “A regurgitating toilet?” “Anti-Muggle pranksters,” said Mr. Weasley, frowning. “We had two last week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing --- well, you can imagine. The poor things keep calling in those --- those pumbles, I think they're called --- you know, the ones who mend pipes and things ---” “Plumbers?” “--- exactly, yes, but of course they're flummoxed. I only hope we can catch whoever's doing it.” “Will it be Aurors who catch them?” *“Oh no, this is too trivial for Aurors, it'll be the ordinary Magical Law Enforcement Patrol --- ah, Harry, this is Perkins.”*

  "Who is Mad-Eye?" asked Harry. "He's retired, used to work at the Ministry," said Charlie. "I met him once when Dad took me into work with him. *He was an Auror - one of the best. . . a Dark wizard catcher,"*

  “Yes?” Professor McGonagall prompted Harry. “Well, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,” Harry mumbled. *“You'd need top grades for that,”* said Professor McGonagall, extracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it. *“They ask for a minimum of five N.E.W.T.s, and nothing under ‘Exceeds Expectations' grade, I see*. Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office. It's a difficult career path, Potter; they only take the best. In fact, *I don't think anybody has been taken on in the last three year*s.”
