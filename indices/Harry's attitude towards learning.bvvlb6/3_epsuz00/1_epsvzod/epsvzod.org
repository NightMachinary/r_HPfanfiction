Aurors arent wizard cops, they are basically special forces who hunt dark wizards and guard important people like the minister for magic or the prime minister. Its quite normal for a 14 year old not to know about something like that, I certainly didn't at 14.

The wizards cops are just called Magical Law Enforcement Patrol and Harry probably knew about them, since he didn't ask anybody about them when they were mentioned.
