This is the problem with so much of Rowling's canon.

She tells, she doesn't show.

Throughout the whole books we're constantly told how good he is at DADA, how he's top of the class. Alright, half the classes were useless because of the teachers (best school, remember), but let's take that at face value.

Where do we actually see him do /anything/ impressive? When have we seen him cast anything except for the stunner and disarming spell? Hell, that's even what she wrote him to beat Voldemort with.

Literally the only impressive or above-average thing he did was when he cast the patronus in the third book to drive away those dementors. And that was apparently a very overrated spell anyway, since it just needs emotion and he taught it to his contemporaries not long after: j see no reason they also couldn't have learned it in 3rd year if taught.

Seriously, what has he actually done or shown for him to be considered the best at defence? As far as I can remember, almost literally nothing.

This is a deeper problem with the Canon writing. Rowling constantly asserts many things, but they're never shown to be true. Voldemort is supposed to be very intelligent, but he acts like an idiot. Death Eaters are supposed to be very frightening, but a group of school children get away from a fight with them nearly unscathed.

There's a lot of issues.
