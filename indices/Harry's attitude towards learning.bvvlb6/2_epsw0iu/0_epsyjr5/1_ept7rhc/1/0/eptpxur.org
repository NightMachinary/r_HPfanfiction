Half of these are unrelated to combat though - like getting taught protective spells in DH by Hermione, or throwing off imperious requires willpower or whatever.

The wandlore thing is funny though, since it's unrelated, but also untrue. Like how exactly does he know wandlore?

And yeah, ancient magic....? What ancient magic...? The ancient magic of insane luck lmao?

The death eaters (and Voldemort, to an extent) are also complete pushovers. I agree, it's Rowling underpowering them, not Harry and Co. being particularly skilled or powerful.
