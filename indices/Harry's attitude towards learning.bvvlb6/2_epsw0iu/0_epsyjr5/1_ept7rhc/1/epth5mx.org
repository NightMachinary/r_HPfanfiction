  Has a superior grasp of ancient magic

What would that be?

  and wandlore than Voldemort.
#+end_quote

I fail to see how that is impressive.

  At 13, successfully casts a corporeal Patronus in the face of Dementors.
#+end_quote

Take note that he managed it because he knew that he has managed it, after he realised that the patronus caster that saved him was not his dad but himself

  Harry sat down too. He explained what he'd seen; how, as the nearest Dementor had lowered its mouth to Harry's, a large silver something had come galloping across the lake and forced the Dementors to retreat. Hermione's mouth was slightly open by the time Harry had finished. “But what was it?” “There's only one thing it could have been, to make the Dementors go,” said Harry. “A real Patronus. A powerful one.” “But who conjured it?” Harry didn't say anything. He was thinking back to the person he'd seen on the other bank of the lake. He knew who he thought it had been... but how could it have been? “Didn't you see what they looked like?” said Hermione eagerly. “Was it one of the teachers?” “No,” said Harry. “He wasn't a teacher.” “But it must have been a really powerful wizard, to drive all those Dementors away... If the Patronus was shining so brightly, didn't it light him up? Couldn't you see ---?” “Yeah, I saw him,” said Harry slowly. “But... maybe I imagined it... I wasn't thinking straight... I passed out right afterward...” “Who did you think it was?” “I think ---” Harry swallowed, knowing how strange this was going to sound. “I think it was my

  And then it hit him --- he understood. He hadn't seen his father he had seen himself --- Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand. “EXPECTO PATRONUM! ” he yelled. And out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless cloud of mist, but a blinding, dazzling, silver animal. He screwed up his eyes, trying to see what it was. It looked like a horse. It was galloping silently away from him, across the black surface of the lake. He saw it lower its head and charge at the swarming Dementors... Now it was galloping around and around the black shapes on the ground, and the Dementors were falling back, scattering, retreating into the darkness... They were g

  At 14, learns more powerful magic that most adults cannot perform such as the Shield Charm
#+end_quote

Only the shield charm.

#+begin_quote
  as well as many other powerful spells ahead of time such as the Stunning Charm, Reductor Curse, etc.
#+end_quote

Both the Stunning Charm and the Refuctor curse are something a fifth year could learn. Learning it a year early is nice, but it doesn't seem that impressive. What would be the other spells that you had in mind when you wrote "etc."?

#+begin_quote
  Beat Voldemort in priori incantatem.
#+end_quote

Voldemort also wasn't giving his all. He was distracted by the new magic and fascinated.

#+begin_quote
  "Do nothing!" Voldemort shrieked to the Death Eaters, and Harry saw his red eyes wide with astonishment at what was happening,

  Out-duels multiple Death Eaters in OotP, HBP and DH.
#+end_quote

Yes, but the death eaters don't seem to be all that compatent canonically or any good.

#+begin_quote
  Self-teaches mastery of Occlumency in DH.
#+end_quote

I always disagreed with this. We've seen him use this supposed Occlumency once.

#+begin_quote
  His scar burned, but he was master of the pain; he felt it, yet was apart from it. He had learned control at last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape. *Just as Voldemort had not been able to possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could not penetrate Harry now, while he mourned Dobby.* *Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out . . .* though Dumbledore, of course, would have said that it was love. . . .
#+end_quote

It looks to me that it was more that he used his strong emotions like grief and mourning to drive him out.

#+begin_quote
  Is able to cast the campsite protection spells in DH.
#+end_quote

I'll give you this one. It is somewhat impressive. Then again, considering he is never prepared, being compatent once seems bigger than ever.

#+begin_quote
  Resisted the Imperius Curse from Barty Jr and Voldemort himself
#+end_quote

Barty Jr was not in the best state of mind. He was under the imperius for extreme periods of time, and he suffered dementors. It is very much possible that his decreased mental state weakened his will and his spell. Now, it was never stated that your will has to overpower someone else's, but considering someone will a strong will can break free, and considering you highlighted Voldemort as an example instead of saying he resisted the imperius, I'll assume that will is taken into the account, and therefore someone who is heavily independant or dislikes obeying others, would have a good chance or resisting Barty. Voldemort is a different issue. It could be that the horocrux in Harry helped him resist, after all its two "minds" fighting one, or really how effective would be imperius against yourself? And Harry is part Voldemort both in Horocrux and in blood. Nevertheless, I will give you this one too. Him resisting Voldemort is impressive.
