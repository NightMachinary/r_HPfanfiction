  If you remember, he was told by the spectres to break it, to cause a distraction.

The fact that there were spectres at all was because Harry won the contest.

  /Don't break the connection./

  I know, Harry told the music, I know I mustn't ... but no sooner had he thought it, than the thing became much harder to do. His wand began to vibrate more powerfully than ever ... and now the beam between him and Voldemort changed, too ... it was as though large beads of light were sliding up and down the thread connecting the wands -- Harry felt his wand give a shudder under his hand, as the light beads began to slide slowly and steadily his way ... the direction of the beam's movement was now towards him, from Voldemort, and he felt his wand shudder angrily ...

  As the nearest bead of light moved nearer to Harry's wand tip, the wood beneath his fingers grew so hot he feared it would burst into flame. The closer that bead moved, the harder Harry's wand vibrated; he was sure his wand would not survive contact with it; it felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers --

  He concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the bead backwards towards Voldemort, his ears full of phoenix song, his eyes furious, fixated ... and slowly, very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then, just as slowly, they began to move the other way ... and it was Voldemort's wand that was vibrating extra hard now ... Voldemort who looked astonished, and almost fearful ...

  One of the beads of light was quivering, inches from the tip of Voldemort's wand. Harry didn't understand why he was doing it, didn't know what it might achieve ... but he now concentrated as he had never done in his life, on forcing that bead of light right back into Voldemort's wand ... and slowly ... very slowly ... it moved along the golden thread ... it trembled for a moment ... and then it connected ...

  At once, Voldemort's wand began to emit echoing screams of pain ... then -- Voldemort's red eyes widened with shock -- a dense, smoky hand flew out of the tip of it and vanished ... the ghost of the hand he had made Wormtail ... more shouts of pain ... and then something much larger began to blossom from Voldemort's wand tip, a great, greyish something that looked as though it was made of the solidest, densest smoke ... it was a head ... now a chest and arms ... the torso of Cedric Diggory.

To be honest, a lot of the things you say make it sound like you have watched the movies but not read the books.

Stuff like the Patronus Charm - it was /always/ the case that the impressive thing about it was conjuring it in the presence of Dementors. As anyone who has read PoA could tell you, Harry is able to conjure a corporeal Patronus in the absence of Dementors /months/ before he is able to conjure one with Dementors present (the incident in which he casts one at Malfoy pretending to be a Dementor). Even after his first corporeal patronus, he continued to struggle greatly against actual Dementors.

What the DA did is equivalent to Harry conjuring the Patronus against Malfoy, not equivalent to his conjuring it against actual Dementors.

Similarly, with the Stunning Charm - in the books, we see this being used to take down dragons, we see Aurors use it as their standard spell, and we know that if a human is hit with multiple stunners, they can die. It is clearly a powerful spell. The fact that Harry learnt it in GoF as part of his tournament preparation (not as part of the standard curriculum) is a testament to his ability; it doesn't make the Stunning Charm weak.
