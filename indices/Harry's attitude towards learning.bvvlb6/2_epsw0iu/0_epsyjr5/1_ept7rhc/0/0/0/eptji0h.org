I think its more of a fanon thing than a movie thing. Lots of fanfics have the characters regularly use stunning and shield charms in first year, not to mention making stuff like Occlumency is not only common knowledge but something that you learn before even entering Hogwarts. People really forget how hard magic is in canon.
