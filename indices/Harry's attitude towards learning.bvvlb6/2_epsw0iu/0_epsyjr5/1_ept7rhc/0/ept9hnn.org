We clearly have very different ideas and perceptions of Canon - some of the things you listed gave me a good laugh, others proved my point, and still others are irrelevant to the question: such as priori Incantatum, another dues ex machina Rowling created, and one where he certainly didn't beat anyone with. If you remember, he was told by the spectres to break it, to cause a distraction.

As I told the other guy, we can agree to disagree, it's doubtful there's any use discussing this when we see things to differently.
