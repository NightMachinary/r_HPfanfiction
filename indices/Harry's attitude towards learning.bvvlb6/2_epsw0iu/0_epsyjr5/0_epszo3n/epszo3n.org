  Where do we actually see him do anything impressive?

Deathly Hallows, where he fight Death Eaters on multiple occasions and comes out victorious, just during the battle of the seven Potters he kills like three of them and during the battle of Hogwarts he downs a lot more.

He is also very proficient with the protective magic, using reliable protective enchantments on the places they were at and using the shield charm protecting other from curses cast by Voldemort.

Ron, Ginny, and Neville were both injured and Hermione nearly died then so not really unscathed .
