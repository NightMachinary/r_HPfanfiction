But what does he actually /do/? Is it anything that half the students in his year can do? As you admitted, he really only uses three spells, over and over - disarm, stun, and shield (protego). I don't remember any enchantments, either.

As for them getting away from the Dep. of Mysteries, half of those injuries were from experiments there (Ron brain attack), not the Death Eaters. Who, as I might remind you, are grown adults who are part of a feared terrorist organization, yet they can't even manage to seriously maim a single student. So yes, pretty much unscathed, I'd say!

And since when do stunning spells reliably take down opponents....? It takes one other enemy to cast "ennervate", and they're back up at full capacity.

I guess you can try and argue that these simple spells are most effective, but then that doesn't really take away from anything I said, does it, in that Harry doesn't do anything impressive to warrant the reputation.

Him beating death eaters with absolutely nothing of note is more of a testament to how pathetic Rowling wrote them to be (in contrast to their reputation), and really further proves my main point that Rowling has a problem of writing one thing, but then failing to show it in action.
