Oh yeah, I make no secret of the fact that I hate Canon and think Rowling is a highly overrated, sub-par author when compared to her contemporaries.

I'll admit I had a laugh when she anonymously released her crime book, and it was a complete failure with only 1,500 sold the first week, totally dead in the water with lukewarm reviews.... Then someone gave an "anonymous tip" (not suspicious at all) and boom, #1 on Kindle and half a million more books hurried into production.

So really, it's a love-hate relationship with Harry Potter - love the fanon, hate the Canon, lol.

And don't get me started on all the asinine retconning she's done over the years. If there was ever a proper example for virtue signalling, it's Rowling retroactively making characters gay or black in some vain attempt to get social credit.

There's plenty of good literary reasons to dislike the Canon, and certainly plenty of good reasons to dislike its author...
