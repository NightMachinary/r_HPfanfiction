Honestly, I'm on your side in this debate but coming from a different angle.

I think Rowling for the most part did a good enough job justifying Harry's skill (for the most part).

But the bigger problem is just that some readers/viewers have different expectations/standards from the story and how it handles magical skill and combat.

I was never satisfied with Harry's grasp on magic and the manner in which everyone, bad guys included, used magic and learnt it. It came across as incredibly limited and uncreative.

But at the end of the day you have to look at it like Quidditch. Rowling purposefully didn't put much effort or thought into Quidditch because sports don't interest her.

I think she did the same thing with magical fighting, and to a lesser extent how magic would affect and change a society. If it didn't interest her, she didn't flesh it out more because it's not a crucial part of the story she wants to tell.
