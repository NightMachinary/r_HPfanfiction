Preach.

I especially agree with your last paragraph.

I've kind of grown to actively dislike canon, to the point where I have little interest in re-reading the books or rewatching the films, and there are several fanfics I much prefer to the original works. I sometimes actively avoid stories that self-label as canon compliant.

But at the end of the day I still respect canon for inspiring it all. Without canon, I wouldn't have all these other stories that I adore.
