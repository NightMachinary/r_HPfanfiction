  But the bigger problem is just that some readers/viewers have different expectations/standards from the story and how it handles magical skill and combat.

I think you've nailed it. And I agree with everything else you said.

After so much fanon and other fantasy epics like LotR and ASoIAF, you start to expect much more from HP, even in a weird retroactive way. At the end of the day, it was a children's book scrawled on a napkin, one that was never intended to turn into what it has become.

Looking at it now as an adult, there's so many glaring issues with plot, continuity, characters, etc etc. That's why evil Dumbledore was so popular in mid-2000s, because Book 1 was especially bad when looked at critically - I'm sure you know what I mean...

At the end of the day, even though I kind of hate Canon after seeing everything it could have been in fanon, I do still respect that it inspired so much other writing.
