  It's not how many times he succeeds in disarming, it's how many times he casts it
#+end_quote

still just three times.

  And yeah, any spell would have been enough to kill Voldemort... another perfect example of everything I've been saying so far. Instead of requiring something interesting, clever, or impressive, he gets out of another supposedly dire situation because of Rowling's love for dues ex machina.
#+end_quote

I totally agree with that, Harry beating Voldemort because he was lucky enough to steal Malfoys wand is pretty much my least favorite part of the books. But Harry was still a skilled wizard.

  Which curses and hexes? It's been a while since I read canon, I'd love for you to refresh my memory if you're right.
#+end_quote

Look there are online list of spells Harry casts in the books, I dont really feel like going through each battle and pick them up, but just for example he uses the blasting curse to take out a death eater during the battle of the seven potters and the Cruciatus to take out one of the Carrows and there is this part during the battle of Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  Harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd.

  That being said, how would this be impressive? Draco Malfoy and even 3rd Year Ginny Weasley could cast hexes. Or do you consider anything mildly offensive at all to be impressive?
#+end_quote

Its not their nature as hexes which makes them impressive but that he has a variety of spells uses to take out death eaters.

#+begin_quote
  Where do you get that most adults can't cast it?
#+end_quote

Its the entire reason why Fred and George were so sucessful with their Shield Hats

#+begin_quote
  *“You wouldn't believe how many people, even people who work at the Ministry, can't do a decent Shield Charm,”* said George. “ 'Course, they didn't have you teaching them, Harry.” “That's right. . . . Well, we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh, you know, challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off. But the Ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff! And we're still getting massive orders!” “So we've expanded into a range of Shield Cloaks, Shield Gloves . . .”

  Well, a note, that's not what myself (and I think most people) think of when they think of enchanting in the HP world. Afaik the word and concept of "warding" is fanonish, but that would really fall under that category.
#+end_quote

At many points in the books spells like that are called protective enchantments. Just this for example

#+begin_quote
  if we're staying, we should put some *protective enchantments* around the place,” she replied, and raising her wand, she began to walk in a wide circle around Harry and Ron, murmuring incantations as she went. Harry saw little disturbances in the surrounding air: It was as if Hermione had cast a heat haze upon their clearing. “Salvio Hexia . . . Protego Totalum . . . Repello Muggletum . . . Muffliato . . . You could get out the tent, Harry. . . .”

  Anyway - so he's the best at defence and an impressive fighter because Hermione taught him those spells after months of being fugitives?
#+end_quote

No protective spells were explicitly tested for during the O.W.L and thats where he had a better grade then Hermione, also nowhere is it said that Hermione taught him the Spells. Nowhere does it says he didn't know them. She started because she was the one who suggested it.
