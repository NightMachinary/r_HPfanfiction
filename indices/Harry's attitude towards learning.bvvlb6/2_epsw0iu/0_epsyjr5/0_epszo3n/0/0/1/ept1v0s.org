  No I didn't, he barely disarms anybody, after Goblet of fire the only people he disarms were Stan Shunpike(who he was explicitly avoiding to kill because he was under the imperius curse) and Goyle. And against Voldemort pretty much any spell would have been enough to kill him and Harry was aware of it.

It's not how many times he succeeds in disarming, it's how many times he casts it, along with the the stunner. And yeah, any spell would have been enough to kill Voldemort... another perfect example of everything I've been saying so far. Instead of requiring something interesting, clever, or impressive, he gets out of another supposedly dire situation because of Rowling's love for dues ex machina.

  During fights he mostly uses a lot of different curses and hexes and occasional stunning charms
#+end_quote

Which curses and hexes? It's been a while since I read canon, I'd love for you to refresh my memory if you're right.

That being said, how would this be impressive? Draco Malfoy and even 3rd Year Ginny Weasley could cast hexes. Or do you consider anything mildly offensive at all to be impressive?

  the shield charm itself is a impressive feet since most adults cant even cast it.
#+end_quote

Where do you get that most adults can't cast it?

Either way, other students also didn't have much trouble learning it - I fail to see how that's very impressive in the least. It's one of the three main spells he uses.

  Hermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering. Though Harry could have happily lain down and slept, he staggered to his feet, drew out his wand, and started casting the usual protective spells around them.

Well, a note, that's not what myself (and I think most people) think of when they think of enchanting in the HP world. Afaik the word and concept of "warding" is fanonish, but that would really fall under that category.

Anyway - so he's the best at defence and an impressive fighter because Hermione taught him those spells after months of being fugitives?

Again, it's been a while, but I'm pretty sure if you turn to the beginning of Deathly Hallows, Hermione was the one casting them to start and he didn't know them.
