On some details perhaps, but nearly as much as you seem to think. I'm just not impressed. At all.

I don't think anything you put forth seriously undermines my main assertion that Rowling doesn't actually show what she tells in practice; and the elite, evil, feared death eaters being owned by school children with simple spells is just another example of this.

You see it as evidence that Harry is strong or particularly skilled - I see it a different way. As I said, we can agree to disagree.
