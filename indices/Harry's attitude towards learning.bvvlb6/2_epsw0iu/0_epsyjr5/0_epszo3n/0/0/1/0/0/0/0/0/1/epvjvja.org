Actually, now that I mention it, I'm reading a review of that same crime book, and holy crap, both the book and review is cringe as fuck. Just listen to this stunning endorsement:

#+begin_quote
  Rowling tries to bring a contemporary edge to this novel by featuring a beautiful biracial victim and delving into the demimode of high fashion and hip-hop royalty . . .
#+end_quote

Tell me everything about this doesn't make you want to throw up. Just, everything about it. What the hell even /is/ hip-hop royalty? The 'demimode of high fashion' - can there be a more pretentious phrase?

Also, it's fine that people get together with who they feel for, but pushing interracial relationships to seem chic or progressive is just so disgusting to me, especially when there have been so many studies showing [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1448064/][increased negative behavior and health risks for mixed race children]] due to the stress and loss of identity formation;

#+begin_quote
  Mixed-race whites and Asians show significantly greater risk for considering suicide, having sex, repeating a grade, and being suspended.
#+end_quote

Fuck, I guess it's accurate that the only "beautiful biracial" person in her novel is a corpse. Just terrible, on every level.

You can kind of see this thing on [[/r/hapas][r/hapas]], it's pretty sad. Anyway, this is only vaguely related, but just another perfect example of why I think Rowling is just a poor quality person.
