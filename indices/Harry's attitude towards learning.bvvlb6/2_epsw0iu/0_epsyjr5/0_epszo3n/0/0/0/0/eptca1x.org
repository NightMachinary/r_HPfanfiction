Firstly you can fail at a single spell and still pass, Hermione didnt fail defense in third after she couldn't get past the boggart. Secondly a lot of people probably fail them, its not like you are excepted to pass all your O.W.L

also the average grade for them should be acceptable, you dont need a good shield charm to achieve that.

Then there is also the differences in how good you are at shield charms, in goblet of fire Harry could not even block a single jinx cast by Hermione, in Deathly Hallows he protects a lot of people from powerful curses.

Or they just never used it past school and became unable to use it, defense against the dark arts would rarely be used outside of schools, except for the occasional pest like boggarts or red caps.
