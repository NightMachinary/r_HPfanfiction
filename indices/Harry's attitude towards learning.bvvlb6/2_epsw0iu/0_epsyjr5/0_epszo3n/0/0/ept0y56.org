  as you admitted, he really only uses three spells, over and over - disarm, stun, and shield (protego).

No I didn't, he barely disarms anybody, after Goblet of fire the only people he disarms were Stan Shunpike(who he was explicitly avoiding to kill because he was under the imperius curse) and Goyle. And against Voldemort pretty much any spell would have been enough to kill him and Harry was aware of it.

During fights he mostly uses a lot of different curses and hexes and occasional stunning charms and the shield charm itself is a impressive feet since most adults cant even cast it.

  I don't remember any enchantments, either.

Here , in Deathly Hallows when Harry, Ron and Hermoine were in hiding they were using different spells to protect themselves from Death Eaters.

  Hermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering. Though Harry could have happily lain down and slept, he staggered to his feet, drew out his wand, and started casting the usual protective spells around them.
