First of all, half of Harry's class indeed know most of the same defense spells as him, /because he taught them/. It may seem like stunners or simple shields are nothing, but Harry was about as good is not better than the others champions who were the best seventh year of their respective schools, and most ministry employees aren't even able to conjure a good shield. It's not Harry not the death eaters who suck, it's just that you seems to picture the wizard fights more flamboyant that they really are in canon.

Also props for not mentioning Harry knowing semi-advanced protection charms in DH and learning the Patronus at thirteen. And in a 1 vs 1 a stunner is as guaranteed a win as the killing curse.
