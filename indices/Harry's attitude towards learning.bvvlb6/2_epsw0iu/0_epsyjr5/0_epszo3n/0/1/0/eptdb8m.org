  but Harry was about as good is not better than the others champions who were the best seventh year of their respective schools
#+end_quote

Yes, that's what Rowling made Hermione say, but its not true. Let's compare then task by task, shall we?

FIRST TASK:

CEDRIC: "Cedric did this weird thing where he Transfigured a rock on the ground. . . turned it into a dog. . . he was trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of him."

FLEUR: "And that Fleur girl tried this sort of charm, I think she was trying to put it into a trance - well, that kind of worked too, it went all sleepy, but then it snored, and this great jet of flame shot out, and her skirt caught fire - she put it out with a bit of water out of her wand"

KRUM: "Hit it with some sort of spell right in the eye."

HARRY: Summoning charm and flying.

So lets compare. Cedric used complex transfiguration, Fleur put a /dragon/ to sleep completely, Krum disabled the Dragon's eye, Harry summoned his broom and flew. Ranking on complexity:

1. Fleur
2. Cedric
3. Krum and Harry

SECOND TASK:

CEDRIC: "Cedric Diggory, who also used the Bubble-Head Charm"

FLEUR: "Fleur Delacour, though she demonstrated excellent use of the Bubble-Head Charm"

KRUM: "Harry turned and saw something monstrous cutting through the water toward them: a human body in swimming trunks with the head of a shark. ... It was Krum. He appeared to have transfigured himself- but badly."

HARRY: Needed Dobby for everything. Dobby told him who to rescue and gave him the method how. Needed Myrtle's help on where to swim.Zero points. If I really wanted to give him some points, then he did manage to save the most hostages.

Krum performed complex transfiguration, Fleur and Cedric managed charms, Harry...did nothing.

Ranking:

1. Krum.
2. Cedric
3. Fleur and Harry.

Notes: Technically Harry deserves to be at fourth place, but since he did manage his task, I put him with Fleur.

THIRD TASK:

CEDRIC: "as he had done with the skrewt, and shouted "Stupefy!''just as Cedric yelled the same thing."

FLEUR: "I Stunned Fleur Delacour as she passed"

KRUM: "And then Harry heard Krum's voice. "Crucio!" "

HARRY: (I am only listing spells that managed to acomplish their purpose) Point me Spell, Riddikulus, Impedimenta, Reducto, Stupefy, Solved a riddle, Expelliarmus

Cedric managed a stupify, Krum managed a crucio(although he was under the imperius", Harry managed bunch of spells of various branches.

Ranking:

1. Harry
2. Cedric and Krum
3. Fleur.

Notes: Cedric alongside Harry did win, that's why he is so high up. Krum managed to perform some seriously hard magic, so that puts him up there too. Fleur was useless.

Overall Score:

CEDRIC: 3 times at the second place

FLEUR: 2 times third place, one time first place.

KRUM: 1 time third place, 1 time second place, 1 time first place

HARRY: 2 times third place, one time first place.

Overall rankings:

1. Krum
2. Cedric
3. Fleur and Harry

Notes: Voldemort fight is not added since:

1. Only Harry fought him.

2. It doesn't add anything or change anything. Harry managed an expeliarmus, Summoning charm and thats it.

Summary:

Despite what Hermione has said, Harry was not the best. Krum was. Harry actually came in the third place in the comparisons.

  Also props for not mentioning Harry knowing semi-advanced protection charms in DH
#+end_quote

Like what?

Edit to my last question:

Yes, Harry did cast some protective spells....once. All of the other times Hermione did it. It is reasonable that she taught it to him in case of emergencies during their travels
