We were talking about Harry's achievements in DADA, the fact that he couldn't transfigure rocks and shit is not relevant. In the third task specifically, the one which relied the most on DADA skills to succeed, he was able to fare better than the others three and arrive to the cup first (even before Cedric, and he didn't have any points on him).
