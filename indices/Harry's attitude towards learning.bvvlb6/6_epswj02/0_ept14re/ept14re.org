Shouldn't eleven year olds find animating toy soldiers to be fun? Transfigure twigs and stuff you can find on the Hogwarts grounds into miniature broom toys and use animation charms - bingo, you've got a miniature quidditch team. Or just transfigure that stuff into toy bikes/cars (like the Hot Wheels stuff) and race them using animation charms.

What's /useful/ to a eleven year old, anyway?
