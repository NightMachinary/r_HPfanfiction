  because none of the trio specialised in Food related magic. They never needed to. Hogwarts had always kept them fed with amazing food

You bring up a good point. I never thought about it that way. Sure one could argue that Hermione and Ron, both being of age and understanding that they'd likely be roughing it at some point in the search for Horocruxes, made a serious error in judgement by either overlooking or simply not brushing up on food-related magic. But that wouldn't be the first time otherwise intelligent individuals made a stupid mistake.
