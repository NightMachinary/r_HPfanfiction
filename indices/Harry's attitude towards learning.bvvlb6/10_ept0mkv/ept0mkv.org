Many of you mentioned his skill in DADA. I don't disagree with that at all. Harry is shown to be excellent at that, him teaching the DA and the paronus and all.

What I meant to ask is why Harry is mostly ignorant about facts and information. I don't recall a single time when he tells Hermione or Ron something that they don't already know of. He could have shown to have some useful knowledge, (maybe household stuff and all) especially when the trio was on the run.
