Besides that, the fact that he don't even know the name of Voldemort's supporters, anyone could have come up to him a moment when he was alone and given him a poisoned/cursed/explosive fruitbasket or something.

For example, in the summer before third year (OOC-ness, just doing this quick):

  "Mr Potter?" Said the wizard, looking fairly nervous, holding in his hands some kind of box.

  "Yes", Harry replied, feeling quite tired after his day spent in Diagon Alley, wanting nothing more than to relax in the hottest bath he could pour himself.

  "I am part of a group that support various causes, the Death Devourers Brotherhood, and we would like to gift you this box of various tokens of our appreciation.

  -The... Death Devourers Brotherhood? Why that name, if I may ask? Oh and thank you very much for the present!

  -I'm afraid that I am not at liberty to explain it to underage wizards. I can tell you however, that our founder, Lord Gaunt, had quite a peculiar sense of humour. However, if when older, you would like to join us, you would be most welcome, our owl address is written inside the box.

  -I see... well thank you very much, I shall think about it.

  -That is all we ask for, Mr Potter." With that, the wizard did a short bow and, having placed the box in Harry's hand, made his way to the stairs, making sure to climb them at a normal pace despite the fear he felt. Soon, he was on the ground floor, nodding to the bartender before leaving via the muggle side. There, he quickly crossed the busy street and, finding an dark alley, put on a invisibility cloak and apparated to one of the roof overlooking Diagon Alley and settled to wait, hoping that the boy would take such an obvious trap, therefore proving (among other things), Dumbledore's utter incompetence.

  He didn't have to wait long, barely an hour when the first floor of the tavern he was watching exploded, showering the street with debris. But what caught his eye, along with anyone in the alley proper, was the glorious skull rising from the smoke, a snake slowly curling around it. The wizard took a few more moments to admire the sight before turning on his heel and apparating in his living room, drunk with joy, success and, soon enough that expensive bottle of firewhiskey he bought years ago for such a joyous occasion.
