Perhaps it's really jarring for him to transition from the Magical world, where he can use magic actively on school grounds, to the Muggle world where Magic is off limits and he's constantly given a crap for it? It's kind of how I am with getting a Driver's license right now, I could do it, I'd more than likely pass, but the motivation to get one is pretty drained because I don't have any access to a Car, and likely won't for a bit.

Plus one of the biggest sources for Magical information, is taught by the teacher that had a life and class so monotonous that he literally died, and just kept teaching as Ghost, and didn't realize for a bit that he had died. The Golden Trio often display, that they're going to learn the knowledge they value, this is why Hermione is easily the smartest, but bring up divination and she'll start chucking things XD
