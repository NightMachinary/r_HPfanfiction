I think this has to do with Rowling's writing. She came up with new ideas as she wrote, so things tend to be inconsistent. Still, Rowling did a lot of telling but not showing. Death Eaters, who supposedly paralyzed the entire Wizarding Britain through fear, have never done anything extraordinary in canon. And the ace of this â€˜terrifying' bunch, Bella, dies at the hands of a frikin housewife.
