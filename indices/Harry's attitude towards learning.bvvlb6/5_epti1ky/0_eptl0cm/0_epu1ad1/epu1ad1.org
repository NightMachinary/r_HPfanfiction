You're falling into that same fanon trap that gives us "Harry and Ron are idiots are par with Crabbe and Goyle who would never pass their classes without Hermione's help". Harry cooks all of once in canon, on Dudley's birthday. The implication is that this is not an uncommon thing, but not something he's been doing every single day since he could see over the top of the stove. Similarly, he's only given a huge list of chores that need to be done all in one day once, and it was after he taunted Dudley with made-up magic words in CoS (also the only time we see either Petunia or Vernon try to physically abuse him, the time Petunia swung at him with a frying pan).
