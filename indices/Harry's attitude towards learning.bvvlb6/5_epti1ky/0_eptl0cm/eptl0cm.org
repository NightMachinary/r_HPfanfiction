I agree completely. This is the reason for my question in the first place. I don't doubt his or Ron's intelligence (bear in mind Ron won a chess match with some serious handicaps). But he is shown to have little to no exposure to anything in the world. As far as I can tell there is not a single time in canon that he explains/tells anything to anyone. (ignoring the Horcrux stuff that Dumbledore tells him in the first place)

Everything Harry is good at in the books is completely instinctual. He's an excellent flyer, even though he's never ridden a broom before. He's got a proclivity for DADA, but he's never shown to be specifically studying it. Hence we have to assume its his natural talent again.

Yeah he's hard-working. But only out of desperation. He learns the Patronus because he's vulnerable to the dementors without it. He learns stuff for the tournament because he has to. Seriously, not giving the egg any thought, especially when the first task was bleeding dragons?

Ron is shown to be struggling, trying to practice Quidditch on his own. He wants to improve. Hermione is shown to have her own weak subjects that she wishes to conquer. Even Neville is shown to be shit at Transfiguration.

What exactly is Harry shit at? Not Potions, since its Snape that's the problem and not Harry. He gets EE on the Owls and does well enough in Slughorn's class.

Rowling could have shown Harry to be aware of some things in the Muggle world at least, trying to answer some question Ron has (instead of making Hermione the one to answer)

Why was Hermione making the food for the Trio during the Horcrux Hunt? Harry has been cooking and cleaning for the dursleys for a long time. Even though he probably hates it, he'll be better at it than the other two. Its primarily DH that irritates me the most. Rowling had the perfect opprtunity to show some skills of Harry, but as someone else said here, its "Hermione and the two useless cretin"
