Ah, I see it now. Did you mean something like “Why Harry cannot discuss West Ham v Tottenham Hotspur v whatever-is-the-main-Surrey-team?”, because of course every English male can discuss football? Why doesn't he contribute any special knowledge from outside of Hogwarts? That's a good question.

There are horrendous holes in the student life at Hogwarts. For example, my teen-age years were full of music. I spent endless hours listening and discussing Pink Floyd, Beatles, Magma, Jethro Tull, Brian Eno, or many Czech music groups. There is no music at Hogwarts, classical, jazz (except for brief Lupin's scenes), or rock and pop. Nothing. There Muggleborns would be in huge advantage, or does Wizarding Wireless Network carry Muggle pop music? We don't know.
