I think there is one deep fanon non-canonical assumption here: that Harry (and Ron) were slacking and poor students lately. Their work ethic may not be on the level of Hermione (who is however a bit ... is there such thing as a studyholic?), but outside of comparison with her they doing just fine. I don't recall any major study problem with them (outside of Harry and Snape issues in Potions), and *BOTH* of them (not just Harry, Ron as well) were doing very well with their O.W.L.s, Harry got eight of them, five EE, one O (Ron got seven and at least some of them EEs).
