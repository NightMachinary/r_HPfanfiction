Before he started Hogwarts he was isolated and had literally nothing to focus on, so even his history of magic text book became fascinating. Then he attends Hogwarts and it quickly becomes the norm and he gets a social life etc. When he returns to the dursleys each summer after that he has something to obsess over instead;

CoS: why aren't his new friends writing to him? Have they forgotten about him while he is locked away?

PoA: how do I get my guardians to sign my Hogwarts letter? I need to be on my best behaviour and not cause Aunt Marge to explode

GoF: wow I have a godfather, wait why am I dreaming these things?!

OoTP: Voldemort returned, friends ignoring him again, saw his mate die etc.

HBP: prophecy, sirius death, dumbledore mission to look forward to

DH: horcrux mission, turning of age, leaving dursleys for last time, Ginny etc.

Harry was smart but lazy and as he got older, there became more pressing reasons for him to procrastinate from studying.
