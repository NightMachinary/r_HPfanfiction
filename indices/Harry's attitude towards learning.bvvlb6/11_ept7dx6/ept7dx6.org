I think people forget that we see like 1% of Harry's life, and most of the 99% is spent doing routine things that the narrative does not consider worthy of mention. Most of that routine is attending Hogwarts. As far as we know, Harry always does his homework, pays attention in most of his classes, does spell practice dutifully, and scores pretty well in all his practical classes. So Harry's attitude doesn't suddenly change, it's just that the focus of the story isn't Harry learning magic. It's all happening in the background.

In the brief moments that we do see what Hogwarts daily life is like, we do see Harry applying himself to a fair degree.
