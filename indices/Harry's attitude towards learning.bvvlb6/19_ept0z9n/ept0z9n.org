It's the effect that Ron has on him. Ron is lazy, unmotivated and entitled as a person, and that attitude rubs off on Harry. Harry himself was an abused child, so he latched onto the first friend that he ever had and began to personify many of his worst traits in tandem. If Hermione had been his first friend, it would have been different, but as it stood, Harry joined Ron in being horrified by her drive for a long time. The silver lining is that Harry never became entitled, but he was certainly a poor student, regardless of the crazy events that occurred at Hogwarts.

Fanfiction really explores this topic in great detail. I don't like Genius!Harry stories because they're OOC, but I do enjoy those in which he is motivated by an intelligent friend or group of friends to achieve his potential. Dethryl's They Shook Hands is a great example of this at play.
