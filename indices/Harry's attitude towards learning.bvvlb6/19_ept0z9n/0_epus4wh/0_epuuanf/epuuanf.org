Many of those OWLs came as extremely average grades. The fact is, any child in his position would have devoured books on learning the truth. One doesn't escape from hell, find themselves in paradise and then proceed to fuck around for seven years, especially if they feel that they can grow closer to the memory of their parents by learning more. Any child would be buoyed into making the best of their circumstances except in the following circumstance.

With Ron, don't underestimate the power of "true" friendship (I say this laughingly because Ron was a dreadful friend for the most part). Harry would have been desperate to hold onto that friendship, so he subconsciously began to feed off of Ron's worst traits in order to appease him. I work with children and know how they tend to feel and act as a general rule of thumb, especially when they are dealing with the aftereffects of severe emotional and physical abuse. And hell, the abuse continued even after he discovered the truth. Harry saw how Ron reacted to Hermione's intelligence and confidence negatively and ensured he would not push Ron away by flaunting intelligence himself.

Hermione's behaviour is unique as well. None of the three act like normal teenagers in total. There are moments when Rowling treats them like five year olds and others when she treats them like adults. It's pretty cringeworthy to read when it happens.

At the end of the day, the books were written for children. Many of the characters are two-dimensional because of that target audience.
