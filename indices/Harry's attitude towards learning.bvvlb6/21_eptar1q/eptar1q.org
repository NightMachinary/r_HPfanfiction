I just thought that he knew that Hermione values being the top in the class, and knew that Ron had jealousy issues. He valued his freindships over his grades.

Or maybe Ron rubbed off on him.

Or maybe since he had always had to hide how clever he was when he was with the Dursleys, it became a habit and stayed with him at Hogwarts, and Ron didn't help as he was not very study interested. And Hermione, she had totally different methods of study than Harry. Harry probably thought he HATED study when really he just HATED being coerced into studying like Hermione. These alll are just theories, don't take them seriously.
