Rowling: "I wanted Harry to be a normal boy."

Also Rowling: "The child of prophecy will see many of his friends die in front of his very eyes. Some of these deaths will be his own fault. He will be raised in an abusive household, living in a mere cupboard and being starved regularly. He will be shunned and celebrated by his classmates in turns, and his best friends will be a loyal (but lazy) boy and the most brilliant witch of his generation (aka moi~ ;-] ). Harry will have the soul of his enemy, the most evil wizard ever, embedded in his forehead. In the end, Harry will defeat Voldemort... with some kind of wand law bullshit idk LOL I didn't plan this far
