The worst is after 4th, 5th and 6th year. I understand that he's a child before that and he may prefer to chill. After Cedric's death, maybe it didn't register completely but after 5th year, after seeing Sirius die (not only by his fault but also because he didn't put the effort into Occlumency), Voldemort duel Dumbledore and learning the Prophecy that guarantees he will have to face Voldemort one day or another, it's preposterous that he wouldn't prepare himself more. Even more, he saw that he can't trust "authority" as clearly proven by the Ministry's incompetence and even the teachers'. If this isn't enough to motivate himself he should just lay down and die. And lastly, after Dumbledore's death he tells Ron and Hermione not to accompany him but at the same time he doesn't prepare... AT ALL ! He learns nothing and doesn't prepare any package of any sort. Hermione had to do it all (again). Seriously the 7th book should be called "Hermione and the two useless cretin".

I think that's also one of the reason why there was so many fanfic about book 6 at the time. The frustration of seeing Harry excel in his mediocrity. In this Snape was right, he thinks (unconsciously) that everything will go well and that he doesn't have to work more to actually have what he wants. He doesn't give himself the means and relish in his uselessness. When in fics people makes him say it's not him that did it but the others... yeah that's about right. He doesn't do that much.
