Blame Rowling for this. She wanted Harry to be an Everyman, an ordinary guy who "triumphed" over evil so she quickly did away with all of his exceptional accomplishments beyond DADA. And even that is told, not shown, as part of his OWL score.

She had him master the Patronus Charm, an exceptional feat for a teenager, but then had multiple students achieve the same feat later /in a single session/ what took Harry months to achieve. She was basically pissing on his achievement at that point.

Part of it can also be blamed on the Dursleys. Curiosity and intelligence have to be nurtured and a credo of "/Don't ask questions/" is a horrible way to do it. While Harry should have grown out of it as he went through Hogwarts, he never did as he never gained an adult influence or role model who looked out or stood up for him and encouraged him.

Harry was an abused child in a children's tale and while Rowling tried to mature the story over the years, she wanted to stick to the characters as she envisioned them initially rather than let them grow naturally and Harry's character took the brunt of this. She ended up glorifying Harry's abuse. His lack of drive and passiveness is part of this.
