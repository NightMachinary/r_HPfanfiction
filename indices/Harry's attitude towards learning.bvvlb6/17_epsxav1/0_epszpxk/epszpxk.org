C'mon, they are at a boarding school. You severely underestimate the amount of free time one would have in such situation. Sure, you have friends, but how much time can you spend with them if the only available social activites are playing chess, cards or talking with each other about school/other people? The only thing to pass the time by yourself is walking around, sitting and doing nothing, or reading.

Take all the time you +waste+ spend on self-centered free-time activities like reading, watching tv etc. Let's be less than generous and take out a fifth of that time, and say that for a year you use that time on reading about stuff more or less closely related to one topic/genre (say, fantasy books). You'll be more than well-versed in general fantasy after that year.
