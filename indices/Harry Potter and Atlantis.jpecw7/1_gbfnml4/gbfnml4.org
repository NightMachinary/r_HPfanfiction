linkffn(Whatever Happened to the Likely Lad by nonjon). More involved with the remnant technology/magic of Atlantis, though. I quite liked this one.

The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/205025][Island of Fire series]] by esama. I haven't gotten around to reading this yet.

There's also a story (whose name I can't come up with right now) in which Harry does something (triggers an artifact or performs a ritual or something) and lives an entire lifetime in Atlantis in a dream.
