Perhaps its been underdone because it sounds like such a simple premise, but its more complex than folks think. I mean, its literally taking Ginny Weasley and sticking her where Ron was, but because of personality differences and the idea of Ron never existing, it leads to some interesting possibilities, pairings, and ripple effects. Especially if Ginny's character is better developed than she was in Canon. Rowling never did her justice and it hurt folks views of her, including mine, which is unfortunate.

It's actually a premise I had considered for some time writing myself. A few years ago I started writing fan fiction, and it was something I had planned to do. Sadly just after I started posting on FF.net I had some health troubles and had to stop writing. These days I read a lot from hospital beds, so I am often looking for stories that are similar to ideas I wish I could write myself. Living vicariously in a way haha!

So I would love if folks would explore this since it certainly does seem like few have done it.
