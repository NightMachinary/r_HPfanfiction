Ok, I don't have any offhand for you, but you might want to check the alwaysAGirl!Ron fics, as any of them on the nurture side of nature vs nurture will fit what you want pretty well.

(A female Ron would have most of the environmental factors of Ginny, being last child, spoilt, taught to daydream about Harry, older brothers, female). Thus depending on how the author feels about nature vs nurture will decide if the character reads more like Ginny or Ron.

Although it does seem fanfic prefers the nature side of the coin. Probably to keep the characters recognizable for fans...
