Sensible, I just see the story you want likely being labeled like that (ie, "what if the sixth Weasley was born a girl" is likely to be labeled fem!Ron regardless of if the personality fits or not.)

Another idea to check for is the "What if all the Weasley children we're one year older". Changing the Golden Trio dynamic without changing the Weasley dynamic
