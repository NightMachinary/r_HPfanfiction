  Thus depending on how the author feels about nature vs nurture will decide if the character reads more like Ginny or Ron. Although it does seem fanfic prefers the nature side of the coin. Probably to keep the characters recognizable for fans...

Yea and I think that's my main concern with a female!Ron. I don't WANT the character to be recognizable to the original character beyond simply being a Weasley and even then that aspect is not that critical part, but NOT being Ron is.
