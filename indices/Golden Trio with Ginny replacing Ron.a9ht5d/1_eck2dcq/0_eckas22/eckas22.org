Yes. So basically the idea is that instead of having Ron, they have Ginny, and then stop having kids (as they do after having Ginny in Canon), so Ron never comes to exist.

So basically NOT a female!Ron, but simply Ginny in place of Ron. So, for the most part, Ginny's personality. That said, I was not remotely picky on staying true to her canon personality, but mainly avoiding Ron's or the idea of Ron entirely (so not similar to him).
