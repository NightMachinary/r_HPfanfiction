I don't recall making anything up. I guess when it's time to choose teams you can pick Ron. I'm sure you'll be fine, at least if there's brains in a vat to make out with or hoops to defend against wild quaffles, Ron's going to have your back. Just make sure you bring enough food or he might turn on you and your team.
