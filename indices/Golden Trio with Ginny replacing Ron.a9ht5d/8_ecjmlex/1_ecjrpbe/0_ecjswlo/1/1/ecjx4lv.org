Who says there has to be teams?

Speaking for myself, I can appreciate Ginny just fine without hating on Ron. The reverse is also true. Both characters have good points and bad points.

You in particular seem to spend a lot of time hating on the Weasleys in general. That can't be a very enjoyable way to spend your time interacting with the series.
