"Hermione," Harry breathed through the glass, "You're brilliant. Absolutely brilliant."

The usually crimped haired, speckled faced woman who was often referred to as the cleverest witch of her time beamed back at Harry. The boy who lived, who once slept under the creaky stairs of a dusty cupboard in number 4 Privet Drive of old Whinging. He who once knew nothing of the greatness laid out before him, who had lost and suffered more than most, who in seven short years in this world would brave the most dangerous dark wizard of all time and emerge the victor, the boy, had now become a man. The man whose words bore into Hermione, and weighed on her, but she was unable to answer.

"I would have figured your animagus form would've be an owl?" He quickly inputted, "But the otter, it's brilliant. Really," he finished. Harry placed a hand on the glass and met the swimming Hermione at eye level. She planted a delicate fin and pressed it against his palm. Harry looked into her eyes and his lips broke into a smile.

"Harry," came a call from outside of the classroom. "Harry?" The fiery red locks that bounced on the athletically lean figure of a woman in full Quidditch dressing signaled the arrival of Ginny Weasley. "Harry, there you are. The match is about to start," she exclaimed while fingering the silver whistle that hung around her neck. "Oh wow, Hermione, is that you?"

The sleek ebony figure in the enclosure pulled away from the glass and somersaulted.

"Brilliant! How did you do it? Wait, never mind. You've got to show us more later, knowing you, you have every single detail written down somewhere and I want to know everything!" She pulled on Harry's arm, "Come on, we're late."

"We'll see you out at the game then Hermione?"

"Of course we're going to see her out at the game, she's the Head of Gryffindor after all. But we have got to be out on the field, oh damnit, that was almost 5 minutes ago," Ginny reeled. "Even this crowd's not going to wait for the first game!"

"We'll see you soon then Hermione?"

She nodded as Harry was dragged into the hall, their voices could still be heard talking about Kingsley Shacklebolt making an appearance, Harry being habitually late, even for his honorary opening of the new Quidditch field, flight plans on his new Nimbus, all hurriedly and excitedly until the room was once again quiet.

Hermione rose to the top of the tank, the once sleek fins melted away into her girlish fingers, a shrug of her shoulders as her face transformed back to normal, and her legs parted as she stepped out into the open. She caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror, the dark color of the otter had barely left her arms - covering her skin smooth and black, beads of water running along her figure as the last traces of her transfiguration disappeared. And without the same enthusiasm she had just moment earlier, she solemnly dressed and left the classroom to join the others at the Quidditch grounds.

"Oi," came the stark call of Ronald Weasley. "Have you seen my sister?"

Hermione turned around and faced the rather lanky Weasley, recognizable by their signature red mane, "She's with Harry."

"Figures," Ron said. "Wait, how come you're not with them?"

"I'm meeting with them right now, but Harry's going to open the new field by taking a few laps..."

"...and Ginny's going to fill in for Madam Pomfrey. Right. I suppose I'll walk you then, wouldn't want a lady going off on her own."

"I can take care of myself thank you very much Mr. Weasley."

"Tis not what I meant. I was just..."

"I know very well what you were just implying."

"Still as stuck up as ever eh Hermione?"

Hermione laughed, "Still as thick as ever?"

The two laughed and hugged.

"It's good to see you again," Ron said.

"It's good to see everyone again," Hermione corrected. "After all that has happened."

"You're right," he said.

Hermione noticed the sudden seriousness that fell across his face. It was a look she rather admired, from the usual antics that's often strewn across that mug of his, the little boy that always tailed his twin brothers as the trio caused mayhem and mischief all through the years.

"How are things? I heard you opened a store in Diagon Alley?"

"Zonkos, it was Fred and George's idea, but yeah, we finally saved up enough money for Gringott's to give us a loan. We just opened a few days ago, started with some stuff we've been cooking up since my fourth year."

"Glad to hear that our Hogwarts alumni are out there helping."

"Everyone except the Slytherins."

"That's not entirely true, Malfoy..."

"That git," Ron hissed angrily. "Did you hear him at the trial? He came in all high and mighty, killing Dumbledore, raiding the castle, putting a roof over Voldemort's head. I can't believe they just let him walk."

"Well, Harry said that..."

"Harry," Ron said incredulously. "He was the absolute worst, defending that little maggot, getting that slime off on a free ride. The-boy-who-lived sure went above the law on that one, thinks he's some sort of God now. Blimey, he practically is, isn't he? Oh look who I'm telling that to, you probably worship him."

"I do not worship him," Hermione replied rather defensively.

Ron tilted his head out to the field, "She sure does," he grumbled at Harry and Ginny who were locked at the waist, waving their arms out at the crowds. "You better go join 'em," Ron said before disappearing into the banisters.

"Look there's Hermione," Ginny shouted in elation.

"What," Harry said dumbly as the sounds of the cheering crowd thundered around them.

"I said..." but at that moment the deep luminous voice of Lee Jordan overtook the crowd.

"Wizards and Witches of Hogwarts and beyond! Welcome to the grand reopening of the Hogwarts Quidditch field!"

The crowd roared in approval.

"Before we begin," Lee continued, "Harry Potter would like a moment of your time! Go get 'em Harry," he egged on.

Harry turned to Ginny, but their conversation was inaudible, the crowd leaned at the edge of their seats straining to catch even a word.

"Sorry everyone, it looks like we're having some magical difficulties," Lee professed.

Harry got onto one knee, his heart thumped in his chest, his wand hand reached into his robe, and for the first time in his life they felt weak as it gripped the small black box. "Ginny," Harry began. The entire stadium was dead silent but Harry's words were lost on their ears. "This belonged to my mother. She had left it in the vault in Gringott's with a note, saying that it was my muggle grandmother's, that she wanted me to one day give it to the person that was most important to me in the entire world. For the person that I would move earth and sky for, to the one who would make my life magical even when all the magic in the world disappeared."

"And we're back!" Lee Jordan shouted as his wand hand was outstretched, acting as a boom mic for the couple in the center of the field.

"Would you be with me, forever?"

"Yes!" Ginny cried as she threw herself around Harry, "Yes! Yes, yes!"

"She said Yass Witches!" Put a ring on it. Trust me, you guys will get that one in a few years, and now thanks to my friends at Zonkos!" Lee signaled to Ron who was waiting at the tallest stands, who barely withheld himself from rolling his eyes before shooting sparks from his wand in the air that set off a coverage of shooting stars that danced across the sky before exploding into a large congratulatory ambiguation.

"To the future Mr. and Mrs. Potter!"
