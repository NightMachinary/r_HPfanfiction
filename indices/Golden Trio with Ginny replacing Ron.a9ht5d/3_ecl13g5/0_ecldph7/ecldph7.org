You have simplified the situation FAR too much, to be honest. First off, you are taking a Ginny who was younger and not going to Hogwarts and transferred her personality onto one who was. Arguably there would be quite a major difference between a girl preparing to go to Hogwarts and see Harry Potter, and one who was seeing her older brother off and fully aware Harry Potter was "older" than her, even if by just a year.

In addition, you are assuming she ends up exactly the same person if there was no Ron in the picture. No Ron for the Twins to torment when he was younger, no Ron to alter the dynamic within the household. Ginny would not be the "same" because the Weasley household would not be the same. Might she still grow up worshiping Harry Potter? Sure. But the point I am making is you are taking the exact same personality from canon and transcribing it on someone who would arguably be a bit different in some ways.

Also, a big point I make is that her personality was never done justice by JK Rowling due to her "rushing" her in later as a pairing for Harry. So I never claimed it needed to be exactly Ginny, but simply that she would be replacing Ron. Her personality might be completely different and I would be Ok with that.
