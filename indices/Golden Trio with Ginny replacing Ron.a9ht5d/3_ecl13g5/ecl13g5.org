Let's take her personality from the 1st and 2nd books and place her in the same year as Harry.

​

Ginny opened the compartment door, saw THE Harry Potter, deeply blushed and then without any word spoken loudly closed the door and ran away. The end.

​

For her it took a long time to grow up enough in order to have just a talk with Harry. In order to make them friends at that time you'll have to change her personality a lot and she won't be the Ginny from the books.
