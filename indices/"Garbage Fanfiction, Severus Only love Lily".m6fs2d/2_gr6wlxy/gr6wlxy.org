I've never understood people complaining on a fic because it ships x instead of y. Like... why even read the fic if you're against the ship?

I once read a fic that seemed to be heading towards some sort of weird love triangle that would ultimately be resolved by making everyone happy (one person had a double in the fic). I was somewhat intrigued, mostly because I like one of the ships involved. Then the fic seemed to turn around and beat people over the head with why the ship wouldn't work out, etc. I was disappointed, but it's not really my place to complain on an author for their taste in ships. I just stopped reading it.
