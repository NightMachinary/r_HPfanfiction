When I was active as a fanfic author, I had so many people try to dictate to me what I should write in my fanfiction.

"I like the idea of this story with x pairing, but can you write Hermione/Harry instead with this story?"

I mean, why not write your own fic if you want to see that instead of a Ginny/Harry?
