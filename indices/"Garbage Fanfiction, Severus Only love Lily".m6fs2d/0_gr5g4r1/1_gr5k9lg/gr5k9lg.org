People do that in many fandoms, yeah.

I mean, I like Daphne, but insisting someone change the pairings? Gah.

You see it mostly, honestly, with Hermione in Harry Potter or Ochako in My Hero Academia. Their shippers seem to be the most strident in their demands.

Got to a point with one author where they put in the Ao3 tags something like "Uraraka Ochako Does Not Exist". People still insisted. :)
