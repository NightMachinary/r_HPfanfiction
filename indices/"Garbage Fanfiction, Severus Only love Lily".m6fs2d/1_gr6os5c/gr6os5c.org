I laughed at a lot of reviews that were given to my fanfic when I had them posted. There was one time I wrote a fic in the Harry Potter fandom where I was exploring an AU of what happened if Sirius Black had a child before he went to Azkaban. A lot of people knew the idea of the story and they loved it, especially the way I had it set up- but there were a lot of other people that absolutely hated it.

I think that I had one review that absolutely blasted me because they thought that my fanfic attacked their OTP of Remus/Sirius. When I had a livejournal account, I blasted this review and even showed the screenshot of it so that people could see it.

Now that I am writing my own books, I have people hating on me for what is going on in my own original stuff. You can't win as a writer, lol.
