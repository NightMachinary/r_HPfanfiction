That's one reason I like *Emperor*, linkffn(5904185), so much. The author is a fan of 36 Stratagems and Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and he used them quite a bit. [[/spoiler][For example, Harry's assassination of Draco Malfoy was a beautiful application of 美人计 and 反间计; Ginny Weasley was an expert in 借刀杀人.]]
