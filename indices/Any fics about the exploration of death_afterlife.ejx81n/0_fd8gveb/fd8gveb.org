I liked how this story explained the concept of death thanks to what Harry learns after speaking to the shades summoned by the Resurrection Stone. Death is a peaceful state of being where you're healed of all the hurts of your life, but it's not something that can be explained or that the living could understand. Though the dead slowly forget their lives, they never forget the ones they loved. The time they spend in death is equal to the length of their life and then they're reborn again.
