I like the versatility of Harry Potter magic. Wide variety of Charms(Expansion/Reparo/Shrinking/Enlarging/Cooling/Heating/Rapid Plant Growth), preservation magic, Duplication, etc.

Major upside for the Elder Scrolls magic is Restoration and Alteration. Healing, even spells to cure diseases and of course Transmutation to create silver and gold from iron. That spell, if it were known to that world in real life, would be illegal especially if they don't have a way to distinguish between real and transmuted metals(if they aren't considered "real/natural"). Way too easy to mess up the economy.

I just think Harry Potter magic would have a lot more utility in the real world. Never mind in Elder Scrolls especially with food growth/preservation. Perhaps even enchanted items and magical prostetics.
