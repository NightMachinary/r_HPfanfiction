It's an interesting question. One that really makes me want to read a crossover of Harry Potter and Elder Scrolls.

For Harry Potter magic, it really depends if we're talking about what we see in the books or if fandom headcanons are included.

In the TES magic category I would also include potions, alchemy and enchanting.

In my opinion, both can be viable options if not for the fact that we don't really know HP magic as well as TES. We don't know the true limits of HP magic, we only see it from the perspective of a student in a school in a society where a lot of TES magic would be considered Dark and Forbidden.
