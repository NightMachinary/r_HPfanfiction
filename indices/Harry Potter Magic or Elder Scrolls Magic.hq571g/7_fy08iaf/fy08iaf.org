Harry Potter, it's far more versatile and there's no limited magicka pool holding you back.

Unless you're including Morrowind alchemy in which case it's time for a fortify intelligence potion loop.

TES magic just isn't particularly suited to mundane life, there's a few neat things like mark and recall, and healing, but it's very combat focused
