The thread reminded me of a fic I've read a long time ago that included a Dementor well from which dementors were leaving at will, that had to be closed by moving an essentially enormous piece of stone with maybe runes on it, because people living nearby were terrorized by them. The people were wizards, but weak ones who were never even accepted to Hogwarts (the school was only for the elite strong wizards and for the rest it was tough shit). It was a typical "Harry Potter and.." alternative and probably badly written but I'm feeling sentimental.
