From Rising From The Shadows- "...Dementors were the result of the Blood-Wizard Ekrizdis trying to make Inferi more dangerous by giving them the ability to use magic and the intelligence to use it. He succeeded, sort of, but didn't survive and we've been stuck with them ever since." Fanfic, but makes sense.
