Huh. I never thought about dementors just being out-of-control summoned monsters.

Personally, a theory I was sitting on recently; you know how apparently Azkaban used to belong to some dark wizard called Ekrizdis, and after he died the Dementors were discovered in Azkaban?

My idea was, Ekrizdis experimented on muggle sailors (and the occasional witch/wizard/magical creature) that he caught, exploring how to transfer magic from one being to another, how to transform people into monsters and so forth.

The Dementors are the result of a refined experiment into creating Obscurials from the bodies of magic-infused muggles; lacking the ability to generate their own magic, these neo-obscuri instead try to drain it from others, sucking out their emotions, their magic, and ultimately their souls to try and fill that 'gap' in their biology.
