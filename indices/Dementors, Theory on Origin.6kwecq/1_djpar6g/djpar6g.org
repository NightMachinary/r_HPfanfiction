I always assumed that Dementors were as old as Magic (aka Eternal and Primordial). Saying that the Dementor has a beginning kind of cheapens what made it so scary in canon, to begin with. You also have to remember that if Expecto Patronum is truly one of the counter spells, the Dementors should lose form and die whenever one is cast directly at them, but they don't.
