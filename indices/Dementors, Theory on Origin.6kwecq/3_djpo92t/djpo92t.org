I prefer the idea that dementors are the results of a Dark Lords attempt at perfectingthe Horcrux spell. He would try and rip the soul from a body and place it somewhere else and try and keep the body animated and thinking. The results are the cloaked monsters that feast on souls to try and replace what was stolen from them but can never get back due to the damage done to them. They can't remorse their way whole as they personally did nothing to feel remorse over and now as Dementors feasting on emotions they can'take understand remorse anymore
