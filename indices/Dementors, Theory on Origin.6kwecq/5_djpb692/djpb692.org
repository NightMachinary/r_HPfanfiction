I rather liked the theory used in the Sacrifics Arc. They are creatures from the edges of nightmares. They came to exist in the world by a dark wizard that summoned and bound them to the physical plane.

The theory from HPmor was fine but it didn't speak to me like the one from Sacrifices which is ironic because I liked HPmor more than Sacrifices.
