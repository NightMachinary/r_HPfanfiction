You have expressed perfectly why I haven't been able to finish the sacrifices arc yet, in part, because I feel so very fatalistic when reading it. Harry does amazing things yet always, always left so broken with no effective healing in sight. Some day I will finish it as the world building is awesome; but it won't be until I am in a happier place cuz, damn, it's depressing.
