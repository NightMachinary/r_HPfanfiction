Detectors cause frost on the windows etc and a supernatural chill to the air, their presence brings misery. A phoenix is a being or warmth that brings joy where kit goes. All things have duality, Dementors are the inverse, equal and opposite of the phoenix. If phoenix were born from the first fires in the universe then dementors were born from the shadows cast by that light.
