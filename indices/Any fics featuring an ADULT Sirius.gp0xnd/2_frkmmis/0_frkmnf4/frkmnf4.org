  January 1981. Sirius is a paranoiac, Peter is not a psychopath, James is a dad, Remus is super angry, and Regulus...Regulus is alive.No-one is more surprised than him.

  In 1978, Sirius Black almost becomes an Auror. Turns out even he can't fake his way through the mental health assessment.So what. He has better things to do: Remus Lupin is one. The war is another. He spends weeks at a time undercover for the Order while Polyjuiced to the gills. It's probably his new favourite thing.Little does Sirius know that running from himself will send him on a collision course with his ephemeral brother, but life is funny that way.

  The Wizarding Wars are over, but the work of recovery has only begun. Remus Lupin is trying to find his place in an ever-changing world, and when he is invited to serve on a truth and reconciliation commission, he has to confront the truth that lives there---in the past and within himself.
