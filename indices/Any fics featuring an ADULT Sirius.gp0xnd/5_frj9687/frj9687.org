I'm only linking [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2814791/1/Hatal-Fart-Attack][/Hatal Fart Attack/]] because it operates as a prequel to the other fanfic I'm recommending, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10556030/1/Royal-Ward][/Royal Ward/]]. Mind you, unlike the other one I suggested, Sirius isn't the main character, but he does play a major role in the story later on. He does also date someone(I'm not quite certain they count as an OC?)
