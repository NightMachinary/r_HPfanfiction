I just recommended this one a couple days ago, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1248431/1/Promises-Unbroken][/Promises Unbroken/]]. It centers around an AU where Sirius was the secret keeper for the Potters instead of Pettigrew. It's part one of a 600k word trilogy of fanfics.

It's complete, but I don't recall any shipping in the story(I haven't read it in quite a long time)

Also, despite the funeral at the beginning, just bear in mind they never found the body.
