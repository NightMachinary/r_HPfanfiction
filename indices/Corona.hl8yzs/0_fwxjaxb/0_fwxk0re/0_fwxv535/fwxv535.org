This pandemic isn't going to completely destroy the muggle world, it's just going to kill a lot of muggles, and most wizards don't care about muggles.

If you have wizards help with this, that raises the question, why didn't they help with our various other problems before this? It's hard to keep the story consistent if they choose to help with this but not other stuff.
