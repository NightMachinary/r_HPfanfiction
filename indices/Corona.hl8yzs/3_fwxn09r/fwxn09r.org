Boris Johnson: Thank you saving my life the other day, Minister Granger. But can you scale up the production of your cure to save more of our people?

Hermione Granger: I'm sorry, Mr Prime Minister. Our numbers are rather limited. Even if all of our healers work 24/7 to make this cure, we can only produce 300000 in a year, not nearly enough to cover all of Britain. However, if we push really hard, we should be able to make 15000 over the next year, which would be enough to help those who work with us, and some of the critical patients you want us to save. So, is that good enough?

Boris Johnson: Yes, and I thank again for your assistance.
