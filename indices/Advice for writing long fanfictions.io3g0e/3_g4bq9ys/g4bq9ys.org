Don't worry about your English, most native speakers aren't born writers, and you seem to have basic writing skills in your native language.

I'd say make yourself a plan and stick to it. A chapter by chapter plan can be useful, but this is rather personal.

Also, I'd write in English. Translation takes a lot of time and energy that you can otherwise devote to the story.

Good luck!
