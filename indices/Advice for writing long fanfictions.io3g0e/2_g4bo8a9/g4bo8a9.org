I do public speaking and write speeches so I think my advice should mostly be relevant...

Consider combining all 7 Harry Potter books together in one. You get about 1 million words. What happens during this time? There is an overarching plot and seven somewhat selfcontained stories each with their own subplots. You could consider this as 3 levels of plot. 1. overarching narrative. 2. arc narrative. 3. subplots.

The subplots are there to build up the arc plots or the overarching plot and the arc plots build up the over arching plot. When writing a 1000000 wc narrative it is essential just as with a short story to map out / create a detailed outline for the entire narrative or you end up with inconsistencies and plot holes. Each subplot should either add to the arc plot or the over arching plot.

You can see why this gets complicated right? The hard work is writing the outline. Afterwards, writing chapter by chapter isn't all that hard, if tedious. Also, I recommend not aiming for perfection on your first draft. Stories like this should take 3 drafts or more.

You might say, gee this sounds like a lot of work, well professional writing is a lot of work if your goal is to create a meaningful piece of art that someone would like to consume. If you want to create a stream of consciousness story that stimulates your creativity with minimal outlining go ahead, but understand it will read like that. Its ultimately your hobby and your time.

Edit: For example, include a light hearted pranking session with the Weasleys that explores prank items. Harry or another protag then uses the prank items in the finale somehow. So bam, you get a breather session and it can tie into dealing with the finale. Including this scene also adds world building, an opportunity to get closer to the Weasley family if Ron isnt a friend, resources for a future scene, a foundation for later subplots not only with a Weasley but the ones you pranked. Etc.
