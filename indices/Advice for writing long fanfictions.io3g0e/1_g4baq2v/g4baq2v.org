A summary is an excellent place to start. Then a chapter-by-chapter outline. It doesn't need a lot of detail right away. Just one sentence is fine, as long as each chapter has 1 main point to help you avoid losing sight of your goal.

The final scene is also a good thing to write early. Gives you a place to get to, even if you just change it later.

Plenty of readers want long fics, but they also want them /complete/, and that's the hard part when you have something really really long and you need to tie up a lot of different plot points.

I'm about half done with my 800k epfic. It will be my first >200k that I actually finish. It started as just a handful of scenes I couldn't get out of my head. Then it sat there for nearly four years until I made a proper outline. In less than half that dormant time, I've now whipped it into shape and I'm almost ready to start publishing with a two-year-long weekly drip.

All that said, a real novel is a lot shorter. My epic rambles are all about savoring the rich magical world in extreme detail, but most readers actually prefer a faster pace and more action. Even the LotR books were each less than 200k, and plenty of people think those were way too long. You'll need to find the sweet spot where your fic is long enough to do what you want but not so long the reader loses interest.
