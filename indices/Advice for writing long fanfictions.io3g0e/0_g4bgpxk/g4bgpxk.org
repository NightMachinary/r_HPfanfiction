Hey there!

Firstly, don't worry about your English being stellar; mine certainly isn't. To solve that bit of a problem, try using websites like grammarly or you can type it down on Microsoft World or Google Docs and just correct the words and phrases that have those swiggly lines beneath them. By using this little trick, although my English hasn't improved, the grammatical errors in my book has certainly decreased :)

The problem with writing long novels is that sometimes, you tend to forget or overlook a couple of details. So try keeping a notepad or something and list down the vital details or better yet, summarise the chapter in a few sentences so if you ever get confused, you can refer to it rather than having to read your whole book again to confirm a suspicion.

Next, while a lengthy novel sounds like a wonderful idea initially, it can get tiring to write and if it isn't very well written, read. Also, sometimes, an author has the choice to finish a book early with a nice ending, but still ignores it in the favour of dragging the story on. Make sure that you don't extend the length of the novel just for the sake of it, but rather because it is actually required. The readers are quite observant, and they can just tell when a book tends to do that, so be careful.

Sort out your thoughts. If you are determined to write a lengthy novel, go for it! But make sure you have the ending clear in mind before you do. J.K.R confessed in an interview that she had written the second to last chapter of the Deathly Hallows before she had finished the Chamber of Secrets. Knowing or writing down the ending will make sure that you don't lose track of your thoughts and also, that you know exactly what and all to plot in order to obtain your desired ending.

Also, remember to make sure that your characters have some sort of character change in the end when compared to the beginning; and remember, character change doesn't necessarily have to be positive, so have fun with it!

Whether or not you want to plan out a chapter before writing it is your wish. It works for some people and is considered to be a waste of time for others. Figure out whether you are more of an on-the-spot type of author or the detailed-planning kind.

Don't be disheartened if you lose interest a couple of times while writing a lengthy novel, get struck on how to continue a chapter or even face writer's block. Take some time off and try to write again with a refreshed mind, most of the time, you'll succeed and overcome those hurdles.

Anyway, thank you for listening to my Ted Talk. Good luck with your book!
