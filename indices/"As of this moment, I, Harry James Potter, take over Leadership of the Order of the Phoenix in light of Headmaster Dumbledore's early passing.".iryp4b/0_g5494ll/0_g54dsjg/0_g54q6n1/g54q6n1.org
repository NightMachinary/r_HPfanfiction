Even if Harry had the magical stature to take a position of leadership, I don't think a statement like the OP would be met warmly.

Firstly because it's very pompous.

Secondly because I don't think the Order has a strict hierarchy, but rather acts by consensus where everyone's opinions are valued.

Thirdly because even if it does have a leader, declaring yourself to be the leader rather than being /chosen/ as the leader is the perfect way to alienate everyone.
