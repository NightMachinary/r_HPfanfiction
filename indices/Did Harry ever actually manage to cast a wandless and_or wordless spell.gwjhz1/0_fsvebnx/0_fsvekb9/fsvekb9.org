Honestly, that's good enough? I mean, Harry isn't the shittiest wizard, but it's not like he's exceptionally talented either. I figured he'd be able to do maybe ONE spell without bothering to need a wand. Maybe in the heat of the moment (that's just seems to align with him, since he's always running on adrenaline, and that can give people clarity), but nothing fancy.
