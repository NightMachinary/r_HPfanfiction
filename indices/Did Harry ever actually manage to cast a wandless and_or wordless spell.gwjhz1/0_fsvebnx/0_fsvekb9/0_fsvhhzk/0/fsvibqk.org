Personally, Harry's talents include: lithe athletic build for Quidditch/very good with brooms, very good at the very difficult Patronus charm, can use his wand remotely, can see Threstrals, sarcastic quips, reasonably kind, and sort-of street smarts? Like, to me Harry's kinda scrappy. He had to be if he was gonna survive his shitty pre-hogwarts childhood. And how he gets through a lot of his wild encounters is a mixture of friendship, sheer dumb luck, and being a scrappy sassy kid.

That's it. That's Harry Potter.
