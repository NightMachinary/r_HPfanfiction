Sure, he's not /average/. He can do the Patronus charm (noted for being very difficult) and a few other notable abilities. But yeah, he ain't Tom Riddle (who still seems OP, but he is the ultimate antagonist so...). A lot of people upscale Harry, and I'm trying to go for canon Harry (who is capable but not crazy powerful or anything).
