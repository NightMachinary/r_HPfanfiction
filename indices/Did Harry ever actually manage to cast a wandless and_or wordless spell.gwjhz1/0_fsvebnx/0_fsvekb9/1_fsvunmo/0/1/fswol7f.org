Have you seen the animated series Legend of Korra? There's a skill called bloodbending where waterbenders are able to literally control the bodies of their adversaries. However this skill is very difficult and even the strongest waterbenders need a full moon to be able to pull this off successfully.

And yet there's a person who is able to bloodbend whenever he wants. But in all other regards, he's just a slightly above average waterbender, nothing special.

I sometimes think Harry is like that. He has a natural affinity to cast an exceptionally powerful patronus charm. The rest is luck, love, mum, hard work and plot armor and not him being the second coming of Merlin.
