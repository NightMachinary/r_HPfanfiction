I will say that his content has improved dramatically and that those videos are some of the worst in terms of editing, humor, and just the overall production quality and script-writing (they were the first he made). In regards to the criticism, as a Korra fan I think his points were valid and accurate for the most part. There were only a few things I disagree with, and I would have to rewatch the series in order to actually refute them or see if they're accurate. And it's hard for me to actually sit down and watch a tv show, so I won't say that they definitely are inaccurate.
