Literally the main reason any wizard is strong is hard work and you named that as part of his characteristic. I refuse to believe that Harry managed to hold off Voldemort twice during priori Incantatem and survive all the things he has just by being average with a good patronus. I mean he literally becomes head auror, I highly doubt that's a position gained by being slightly above average.
