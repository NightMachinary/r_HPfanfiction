Just keep in mind that the wiki mixes everything up into canon: books, movies, Cursed Child, etc.

It also assumes things not explicit anywhere (for example, pretty much every character page discusses how they got their Hogwarts letter, got sorted, etc. even if that never explicitly occured anywhere in media).

(my personal canon is books plus Black Family Tapestry genealogy)
