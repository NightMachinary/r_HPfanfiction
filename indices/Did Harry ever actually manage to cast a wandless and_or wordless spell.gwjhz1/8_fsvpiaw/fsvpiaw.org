I read some of the comments that aresaying he did cast anything without words, but I thought he did in the bank in DH. Maybe he whispered but he certainly wasn't heard.

As far as uber powerful, the DADA OWL tester was impressed by his patronus. That's not saying much necessarily, but he was able to chase off how many dementors as a third year? Also, when he's wand connected to Voldemort's in 4th year... well, surely that wasn't easy to hold steady?

My thoughts are everyone has the potential to be as powerful as Dumbledore, Grindlewald, and Voldemort. The difference being practise and perseverance. However, like all talents, some find the talent easier than others. Normally, Harry doesn't show that potential... until he gets freaked out.
