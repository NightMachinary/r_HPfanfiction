He learned nonverbal casting along with his peers in his NEWT classes, but actually using nonverbal casting day to day or in the middle of combat is a different matter. Even Hermione, who was the first to learn it in class (as expected), was pretty hit-and-miss with it in DH.

IMO, Harry's Patronus is a consequence of his personality first and foremost. Casting a Patronus in a comfortable setting is not that difficult, as we see in OotP; but casting one in the face of a Dementor is difficult, because Dementors drain the very feelings that are needed to cast one. So, someone more pensive like Hermione, say, has trouble summoning the sort of pure happiness needed---because how can she be truly happy in a world where slavery is approved even by the "good guys", wealth and influence matter more than justice, and people leave their homework to the last minute unless you pester them about it? Whereas, Harry can push all that aside and just /feel/. Priori Incantanem is somewhat similar.

More generally, I think that everyone's magic is integrated with their personality and non-magical talents. Lockhart is obsessed with how people see him, so his magic gives him a precise Memory Charm and perhaps cosmetic magics, but is otherwise useless. Harry's emotions-on-his-sleeve personality gives him a powerful Patronus but also cripples his Occlumency and makes him impulsive. Bellatrix's sadism gives her a powerful Cruciatus, but it makes her resort to torture when other methods of interrogation---such as Legilimency---might have been more effective.
