You might have an opinion on something I've been contemplating. Whose Cruiatus would be worse? Bellitrix's or Voldemort's? Her sadism indicates to me she thrives more in hurting people whereas he focuses on gaining power and longevity. As you say, one's magic is integrated with their personality, and I think I'd rather be cursed in such a way by Voldemort rather than Bellitrix because of that.
