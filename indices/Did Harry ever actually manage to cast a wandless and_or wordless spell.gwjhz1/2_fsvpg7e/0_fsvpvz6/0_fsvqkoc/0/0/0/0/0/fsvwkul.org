I think most of the DA have a certain kind of "young kid survivability." Like, they go out of their way to disobey the rules of Umbridge to actually prepare themselves for conflict. Neville goes from awkward kid to a very capable, fight-me kid. Ginny, who I already thought was a bit of a survivor because /having that many brothers requires a special set of skills/, flourishes. Luna's quirky intuition (and possible low-key Seer abilities? There's /something/ to her) and general talent was honed and polished in the DA.

Scrappy Harry Potter turned a bunch of random kids into equally scrappy survivors. Snape is also something of a favorite of mine; While flawed, he was undeniably a survivor. I mean, look at their generation. It was really impacted and terrorized by Voldemort's first "campaign." Snape had, in a very Slytherin fashion, considered the situation (which was dire) and decided to pick what seemed to be the most reasonable answer. Playing both sides gave him a unique perspective and a certain level of immunity. While everyone else was playing checkers, Snape was playing /Chess/. And I have to admire that?
