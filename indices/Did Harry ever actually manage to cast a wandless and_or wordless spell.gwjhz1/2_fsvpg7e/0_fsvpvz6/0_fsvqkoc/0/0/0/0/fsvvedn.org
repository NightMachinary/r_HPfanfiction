I'm glad, because I keep seeing him hop around with his dukes up ready to punch the monster, and I keep laughing thinking that's not Harry. Scrappy looks for trouble, but trouble looks for Harry. But yes, when I can shove that imagery aside, Harry is certainly a scrappy little bloke.

Thinking of HP characters (Shaggy and Scooby not included), a person's survivability isn't brought up much. Snape is my favorite character (I reference my former military life if anyone wants to bitch at me for it) and his spying ability is very much a survivor's trait. I'm glad Harry announces that to Voldemort. I think Neville and Luna show a great talent for surviving as well, but if a different sort. What do you think?

I wish the Trio could have taken a nature survivalist with them in DH though. Shooting a rabbit is not that hard boys, c'mon! Maybe if they knew how good Bambi and Thumper tasted they would have done a bit better. That reminds me, I wonder if my ex's dad would give me his recipe for hossenfefor (spelling in English is hard enough, German is damn near impossible). We would substitute some of the rabbit for squirrel and it was magnifique!
