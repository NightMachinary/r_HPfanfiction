Much like John Watson in the Sherlock series, Harry Potter is, in my mind, an adrenaline junkie. Not on purpose; but because he's always been in mortal danger since, what, eleven? He's got to now have that sort of adrenaline-panic-clarity that soldiers get when in the heat of battle.

I agree; when Harry's in a tight spot or freaked out, he gets impressive. But I think that's from unfortunate conditioning, the side-effect of being someone perpetually put into dangerous situations and forced to SURVIVE.
