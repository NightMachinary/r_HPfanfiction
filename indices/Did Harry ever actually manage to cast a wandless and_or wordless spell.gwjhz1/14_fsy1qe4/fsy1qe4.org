My take is this... Harry is never presented as being anything other than within the bounds of normality, except in (a) Quidditch and (b) the Patronus Charm. So, when we see that Harry's very good at DADA it's not in the same way that Snape is very good at potions... he isn't some kind of savant/prodigy, just very talented.

So... the question is when your fic is set.

If you're taking a post-canon approach, I think it's entirely fair to expect Harry to brew reasonably difficult potions, perform non-verbal magic routinely (even if he struggled with it at school), possess good reflexes & instincts and just generally do what we see any adult wizard in canon that is not presented as being "exceptional" without too much trouble. OTOH Harry doesn't show any particular inclination towards some of the more practical kinds of household magic so in that respect I'd follow Tonks' example from OOTP.
