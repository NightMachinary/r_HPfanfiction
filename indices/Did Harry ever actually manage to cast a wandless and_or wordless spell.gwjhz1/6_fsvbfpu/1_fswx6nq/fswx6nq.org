That's one aspect I'd like more world building on. How does the rest of the world cast magic? Wands are good, but I'd imagine a magic staff would boost a users power/control. Maybe some wizards use rune based magic circles and others use chant based spells. Maybe japan or china has a completely different way of casting magic compared to Britain.
