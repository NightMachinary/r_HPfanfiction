I have always thought that Harry had awesome potential but a lot of factors in his life contributed to him not making full use of it. As many others in the replies have said, casting a patronus is no small feat. However, at the end of the day Harry was just a bit above average. He survived due to his instincts, friends and dumb luck. In my opinion, you can power scale up Harry a bit from canon because let's face, his weakness kind of got annoying sometimes. I am not saying to make him OP but at least a bit more competent than canon.
