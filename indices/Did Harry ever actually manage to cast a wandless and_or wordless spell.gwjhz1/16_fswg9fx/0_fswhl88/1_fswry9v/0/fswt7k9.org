I agree with that headcanon but also tack on a few things.

1) The hilt can magically change from one-handed to two-handed. I say this because it fixes some plot holes in both book and the movies, and honestly would make sense if this heirloom kept passing between hands; fighting styles changed constantly from medieval times to the semi-present.

2) Its ability to appear when most needed is two-fold: the individual who actually owns it can have it appear when in great need and a courageous person can draw it from the hat when in need. Because /how else would Godric get his sword back after some crazy courageous person called on it?/ I have to rationalize it.

3) Said guidance system is based around the magical properties of the sword: It takes in what only makes it stronger. I take that to be both literal and kinda metaphorical. It can take in basilisk venom and such, but also /for every enemy Godric/his descendants defeated, the dead loser's skills with the blade became theirs./ So the sword would also sort of memorize techniques and such, like a phantom-effect.
