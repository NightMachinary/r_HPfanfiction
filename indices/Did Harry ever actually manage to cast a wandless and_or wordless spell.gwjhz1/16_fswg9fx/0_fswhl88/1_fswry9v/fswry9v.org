My headcanon is that the Sword of Gryffindor comes with a magical guidance system. It helps explain why Harry, who's never held a sword in his life, was able to fight a basilisk, and similarly for Neville. An ordinary sword would probably be pretty useless in wizard combat.

Other than that, we see Bellatrix nailing Dobby with a thrown knife, and that's about it.
