Human being transfixed to animal I've always assumed is instinct based. Like when Malfoy was turned into a ferret he wasn't think â€˜When my father hears about this' he was probably thinking Run. Hide. Run.

I know in the movie he ran up Crabbe or Goyles pants but in the book one of them just went to pick him up.

Animagus is self transforming and you keep your human mind. Like Professor McGonagall reading a map in front of Vernon for a second.

And sorry I'm replying a lot I just reread the books a lot... like a lot -a lot, well over 50 times. And I read a lot of well written canon factual Fanfiction. So all this canon is in my head and no one to talk to. Again sorry if it's too much.
