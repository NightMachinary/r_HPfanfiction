True. One of my fave fics involves Harry using his pre-existing skills to fight a bunch of enemies. He literally just transfigures half of them into exotic fish and the other half jinxed to uncontrollably dance and laugh and rub their stomach while patting their heads.

It's ridiculous, but all the spells involved are silly and third-year level spells.
