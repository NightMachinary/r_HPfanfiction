Right? Some of this is where a really good fanfic really helps for example I wish I could remember the fic but it was a ‘Harry travels back in time' and was trying to hide his magic levels and abilities. It was second year and the Author wrote something like ‘It was the last transfiguration class before the Christmas holidays and the assignment was to transfigure...something... into glass Christmas ornaments. Harry thought back to the last time he had done this assignment he had made a ornament that look like a snitch. After turning it in he had wondered whatever happened to his when he found out Professor McGonagall sent everyones home to their parents. It wasn't until 6th year when he went to the Weasleys for Christmas and on the tree among the 7 of the Weasleys children's ornaments was a little snitch. Later ...someone... had told him that Professor McGonagall had sent it to Mrs. Weasley back in second year. Harry still holding the ...whatever object it was I really can't remember.... felt a swell of emotion thinking back on that and felt a warmth rush down his arm and through his fingerstips. Opening his hand to look held the snitch exactly as he remembered it as the snitch began to unfurl its wings. With a slight gasp Harry quickly closed his hands back over but winced when he heard... Hermione... gasp “ How did you do that?”

God I probably butchered that scene anyways then I just remember McGonagall coming over and Harry claiming accidental magic and her being a bit disappointed hoping it was skill. And then a few chapters Percy questioning the snitch (I think they went to the Weasleys that year I don't remember why) by saying Harry's not allowed to use magic out of school and he was re animating it. And Ron defending Harry by saying that it's been like that since class. Then Percy being in complete shock that a second year could animate something for that long. Then Harry claimed once again it was an accidentally magic. And Percy left it at that but still suspicious of Harry.
