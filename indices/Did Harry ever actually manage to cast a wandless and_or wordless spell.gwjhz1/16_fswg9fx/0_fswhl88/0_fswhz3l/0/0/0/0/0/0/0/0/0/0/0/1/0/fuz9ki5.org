Well I went to Ao3's to view entire work then Ctrl+f the word Christmas not in back again. So far not much. I haven't had much time to read I'm on a minecraft server and I've given a boon by the servers owner by helping him out and I asked to be put into creative mood while I terraformed the area around the nether portal it's been a week and I'm still not done lol. But I did try a google search using phrases but it mostly took me to a bunch of actual Christmas Snitches ornaments lol
