Indeed! After reading all these comments/replies, I've come to the conclusion that Harry probably picked up some things during their nebulous time "on the run." Like, I can't imagine Hermione ever letting Harry or Ron stop practicing spells or not shoving books at them to just try and absorb /something/ that might prove useful (seeing as her general strategy in life in read millions of books and come away with some form of knowledge no matter how little you actually manage to process). She'd definitely use that handy-dandy library in her handbag to give them books to read, try to give her two friends some sort of edge compared to their (at the time) oppressed peers at Hogwarts. And Harry might have eventually figured out how to at least hunt rabbits and cook them? And maybe there's a third spell had can remotely cast? (Lumos and Levicorpus, and then another)

So yeah. Generally a little above average, picked up some things. But the one thing that has generally stayed a question for me: dueling. I've seen how they conduct duels. The wand, the stances, it all looks almost exactly like fencing. Does that translate when Harry or anybody else wields a sword (like the Sword of Gryffindor)? Because in the book it seems like a one-handed sword, then in the movies it goes back-n-forth. And would Harry and Neville actually be any good at it (because of their general wand dueling background) or am I making a fuss over too much conjecture???
