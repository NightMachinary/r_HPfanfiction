Ah but movie canon is different to book canon. Also I'd even argue 3 movie has a different canon then the others all together because of the director.

Don't get me wrong over all I enjoyed the movie but I've always hated the increase of Muggle clothes. Because as someone who watches a lot of behind the scenes too all the movies I watch. I know they pick clothes that are chosen to express an aspect of the character, Like Harry and Ron wearing shabbier clothes(cause there poor), Hermione wearing pink sweater (to show she's a girl I guess), Malfoy wearing the black muggle clothes (because he's ‘evil') Crabbe and Goyle wearing plain grey/brown muggle sweaters (background colours). And not because they give a shit about what makes sense in the world of the movie.

For example, When there not in class they should still be wearing normal robes if you don't want them in school uniform. The only exception should be Muggleborns and PureBloods like the Weasleys who live very close and interact with a muggle village. But even then that doesn't make a lot of sense because if you think about an 11 year old Muggleborn on the weekend they might dress in jeans and a sweater at first then notice how much they're standing out. Now include sneers from Slytherins and other PureBloods. They'd probably go and change into at least the white shirt and trousers/skirts part of the uniform if they want to forgo the robes. And as for the Weasleys they hated being poor and Harry hated standing out so I can see them just wearing the uniform to fit in.

Some things I enjoyed was that they started miss-dressing the uniforms. Some didn't tie the tie properly or completely forgot the tie. That makes sense for teenagers.

But all of this was the director's choice and honestly I've never really liked him since he said he tried to not read the books because he didn't want it to change his mind of what he thought the movie should be. I'm just glad JK put her foot down on that one and would question some of his ideas by saying ‘But why?' ‘Where's the logic in that magic?'

Sorry, I didn't realize who ranty this was till I finished. I miss talking about Harry Potter.
