yeah. Not sure exactly what you are writing but keep in mind that going to school means you are casting spells all the time and being trained to get better. When harry and co go on their horcrux hunt/stupid idea camping trip they are not practicing or leaning a lot of new shit. So you might want to take that into account and or have them not be dumb and practice or not be dumb and live in a house somewhere rather than a tent for no reason at all. It could drastically change how much harry and co know.
