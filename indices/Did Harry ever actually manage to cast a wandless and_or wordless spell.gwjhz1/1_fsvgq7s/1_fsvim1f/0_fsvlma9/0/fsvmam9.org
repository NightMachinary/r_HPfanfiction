LOL, I understand what you're getting at. I'm writing a crossover. Through a series of unfortunate and accidental events, Harry's on his lonesome with nothing but his old wand, the sword of gryffindor, and Hermione's handbag (which might as well be called a Bag of Holding, it can hold so much shit). Seeing as Harry on his own can either be A) reasonably capable or B) an impulsive idiot teenager, I just wanted to figure out how much trouble Harry could get into depending on how much he can actually do. It's been so long since I read the books, I was uncertain just where his actual "power/skill threshold" is.

From the answers I'm getting, the fanciest thing he's done is cast Lumos remotely. So really, Harry's gonna be pretty average/close to canon in terms of ability.
