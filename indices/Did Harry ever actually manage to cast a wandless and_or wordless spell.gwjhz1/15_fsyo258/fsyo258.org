I think in OotP he shouted out Lumos to find his wand in a panic because it wasn't in his hand. Which is technically wandless magic. As for wordless I'm pretty sure most adult wizards can cast basic charms or charms they use most frequently in everyday life wordlessly. Example being Wingardium Leviosa or summoning and or banishing spells. Anything that would be reflexive magic or you do it so often you just don't think about it.

The only comparison I can think of is as an Adult we don't have to think about how to hold a cup of water and to drink the water. We know how much it's going to weigh in our hands, how to twist your hand just right to bring it to you if your laying down and still keep the cup upright. How far back to tilt the cup to drink from it without overspilling. How much force you need to set it down again. But a small child learning how to drink from a cup might spill just bring the cup up to drink from. All because we've learned these Motor skills by trail and error over 20 old years that its not something you have to think about anymore.
