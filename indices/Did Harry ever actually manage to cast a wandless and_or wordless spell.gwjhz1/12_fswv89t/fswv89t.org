Harry is a very powerful wizard. He learned the patronus charm at 13 when most wizards don't learn it in a lifetime. He killed a basilisk at 12 with a sword and a bird, and he defeated Voldemort before he was 18. I'd say he's pretty powerful. He's even considered Voldemort's equal in the prophecy. Though he doesn't know enough magic yet, or has he reached his true potential in canon. Harry is powerful, and with proper training (not the substandard teaching they provide at Hogwarts) and more confidence in his abilities and in himself, Harry would be just as powerful as Voldemort much earlier on.
