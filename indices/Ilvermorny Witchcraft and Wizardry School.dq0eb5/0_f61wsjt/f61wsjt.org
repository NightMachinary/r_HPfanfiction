Professor Larelle Robins, 39 years old, is a halfblood. She grew up in a working class family in one of the few New Hampshire Wizarding communities. She has dark brown hair and medium brown skin. Her mom is Hispanic and her father was a wizard who emigrated from Britain. She's right handed. She was from Horned Serpent in Ilvermorny, and she teaches Charms.

If she had gone to Hogwarts, she would have been in either Slytherin or Ravenclaw. She very much wants her students to succeed but can forget sometimes that not all of them have masteries in charms like she does, and her second favorite subject is potions. She's a distant (veeeery distant) relative of the Fawleys in Britain.

She has an 18 year old niece named Amanda who moonlights as her teaching assistant. And she absolutely hates chocolate. Her wand is 12.5 inches, beechwood, with a unicorn tail hair core. Feel free to characterize her as you like :)
