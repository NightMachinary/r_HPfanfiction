I made the death eaters goal similar to Akatsuki but not the same.

That is also a interesting idea of Quirrel telling him like Mizuki did. He would then offer Harry a position on his side.

In canon he decided not to get into Slytherin because of what Hagrid said and what he saw of Draco's behavior. Also there was a desire to not go into the same house as his parent's murderer. So Slytherin is out and is next dominant traits are those of Gryffindor. Plus if he gets into Slytherin any Gryffindor that manged to overhear or knows(since Dumbledore can't silence the secret) would try to off him before he becomes a greater threat.
