I think I /could/ see a case for Snape not acting out too much vs Harry. In canon, it felt like (to me) a lot of it came from him seeing Harry as James' son - looking so similar, acting cocky, a star quidditch player, etc - but I could see a case for Snape being more protective if he felt sorry for Harry (eg, seeing how the Dursleys treated him, or if he looked more like Lily, or the like).

That's not to say that he'd be /nice/ to Harry from the start, but I could see such a version of Harry being so obviously - and unreasonably - bullied to elicit some more compassion from Snape, as buried in his heart as it might be.

I could see him sorted into either Gryffindor or Slytherin for this, and it'd depend on the angle the author wanted to take on it. Friend wise, I think it'd depend on how much the kids get told of his situation - eg, if they're just told to keep away from him, that'd have a different impact than telling them that he has a piece of voldemort in his soul, and yet another impact than just saying that he's basically voldemort. If it's the former, I could see any character being made into his friend - if contrived enough. If it's one of the latter ones, it'd probably have to rely on more ostracized/misfit characters, or those that Harry would help save - so if going off canon, the former might include Hermione, Neville, and Luna, and the latter might include Ginny - or anyone else, since I could see Ron in that situation as well.
