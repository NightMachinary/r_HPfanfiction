Are you sure about Snape trying to kill off Harry? It might just be me but that seems a little too far fetched. As much as Snape despised James Potter, I believe he wouldn't kill his offspring even if a shard of Voldemort's soul is in him. Lily's memory would put a stop to that. He wouldn't want to tarnish her memory.

Snape has common sense too. He would know killing Harry wouldn't be a blessing. Lily would still be dead and Voldemort would still be out there. And we can already tell what Dumbledore would do.

I mean, your idea could still work though, if we stretch it out a bit. Snape could be paranoid to the point where he believes Harry is a ticking time bomb. We all know how anxiety wears down on us and with his unhealthy mentality? Fun. He could start projecting his thoughts and beliefs on Lily. Let himself believe she's speaking to him but in reality, it's himself. "My son's soul is tainted. I won't let him suffer like this any longer."

Maybe Snape attempts to kill Harry out of his warped definition of mercy? I actually can go with this either way. Bad Snape seems pretty interesting :)
