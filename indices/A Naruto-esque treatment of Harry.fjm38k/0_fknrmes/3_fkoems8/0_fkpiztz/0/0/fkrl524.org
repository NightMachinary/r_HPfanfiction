In canon Snape's ultimate goal was to see Voldemort dead and destroyed and he was willing to do any thing for it to happen. I can see in a scenario in which he finds out that Lily's murderer's soul resides in her son too soon after it happens might break him. In canon he treated Harry with scorn even after almost a decade to grieve. In this scenario he has even more reason to hate him and he knows that /the brat has to die anyway, so it doesn't matter if he dies sooner rather than later./

But really who knows, it all depends on the characterization and how much he has recovered. I admit I can be biased against him even if I try to be fair so usually have to make a big effort to view his actions objectively.
