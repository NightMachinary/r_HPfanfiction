You can make a case for most characters. But I think the likelihood of Snape not acting out against Harry is slim.

In canon Snape started acting out against him in the first potions lesson, during the attendance and continued it throughout the years.

Harry was not on quidditch team yet and I don't remember him acting cocky at all.

In this universe Lily's murderer's soul resides in Harry. I can totally see Snape trying to kill him during the Quidditch match while Quirrel tries to save him(assuming he even is on the team)

I am iffy on Neville being his friend. Augusta would not want him to associate with him and Neville is too timid in the earlier books to go against her.
