This is a really interesting idea. I would love to see this.

If he got sorted into Gryffindor those who lost someone might bully him saying he does not deserve to be here. In Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw he would be an outcast and treated with scorn. And let's hope he does not get into Slytherin or someone might try to finish him before he can become a bigger threat.

Dumbledore might be the only one who would treat Harry without scorn. Snape would probably treat him even worse and I can see other teachers being frigid towards him and turn a blind eye towards his treatment. Quirrell might treat him well so Harry would probably trust him and he could then easily use Harry to try to get to the stone and try to convert him. Hagrid would like him either way. It did not matter to him that Harry could speak to snakes and this would not matter to him either.

He would probably get sorted into Gryffindor and try to prove that he is not like Voldemort. He would gradually improve his reputation by saving the school like he did in canon but it might take a long time.

I don't know if Ron would even become his friend. This depends on how his parents see the situation. I don't see him becoming friends with Neville.

Harry's only refuge might be with muggleborns. And even then with those who are outcasts themselves. With Dean it depends, if he was already thick with Seamus by the time they meet; he would not be friends with him either but would probably be far more cordial. It might be interesting watching him become friends with Justin but who knows. The only I see him becoming friends with him would be Hermione because she herself would become an outcast and she is strong-minded enough. Percy would treat him professionally and Weasley twins might prank him a lot or make him a partner in crime. It's a coin flip.

If he get's into the team in second year (McGonagall probably won't get him on the team even if the flying lesson goes the same way which probably would not) it would not matter to Oliver. Moody would treat him with suspicion all the time, Lupin would keep his distance and Lockhart will try to make an example of him especially if him being a parselmouth comes out which would be a unmitigated disaster. It should not matter to Sirius as Harry is his Godson.

This is more or less how I see this scenario playing out. What do you think?
