Knowledge is useful but power is power.

It gives an insight into the seemingly absurd and dangerous things that happen so frequently in the wizarding world.

It also touches on a canon idea during Moody's class that I don't think I've ever seen in fanfiction. That the killing curse is not a one-hit kill unless you have the power to fuel it. "All of you could point your wands at me and cast it and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed."
