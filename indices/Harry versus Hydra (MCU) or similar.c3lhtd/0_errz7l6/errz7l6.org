How would you expect such a story to differ from what the Death Eaters did in the books? Voldemort started gaining power in the middle of the 20th century and was defeated decades later - most of that in secret (e.g., many murders were committed in his name before the vast wizarding public was reading about it in the news). Hydra lasted, what, 20 years longer than Team Voldemort?
