Nah, you don't suck. Fictionhunt is a pain in the ass anyway, because it scrapes stories out of ff.net without the authors' permission and reposts them. Basically it archives creative content whether the writers agree to it or not.

...and by damn, there are two of my fics on there. I thought I'd managed to have them all taken down. Time for an email to the archive manager. At least they're cooperative about deleting fics if the writer finds out and requests their removal.
