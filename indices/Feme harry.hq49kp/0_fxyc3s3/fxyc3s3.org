What I hate about fem!Harry:

- Often pairs her with Draco or Tom

- Often makes her into a Mary Sue

- Often forgets to mention the 'issues' which girls generally get as they grow up

- Often makes her into a bitch

- Dumbles bashing very common in these fics, as is Snape, Dark side, and Malfoy apologism
