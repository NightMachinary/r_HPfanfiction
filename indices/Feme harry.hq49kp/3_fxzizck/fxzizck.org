  thus making her a spoiled, snobby and demanding person

That is basically what all Mary Sues end up as, unintended or not. And not everyone who grows up in good conditions ends up an annoying snob. And I second what [[/u/wordhammer]] said in this thread about Dumbledore's role and about how annoying her reappearance would be.

  I would like to know what's your opinion concerning this trope

Honestly, the idea is intriguing but it always ends up with a way too girly character which has more narrative focus on being female than on being Harry Potter.

IMO the best way to handle this trope is to keep most things as they were and only diverge where it would make sense. FemHarry would still be at the core Harry. Being a girl might mean that Dudley would not have gotten away with as much bullying, but overall her childhood abuse would be similar.

Starting Hogwarts, she would be basically the same. However, friends are the obvious divergence. Ron is very unlikely, Hermione as well (or at least not in the way they became friends in canon). Lavender would probably take FemHarry under her wing if she ends up in Gryffindor, the other girls are basically blanks. Maybe Padma in Ravenclaw and Susan or Hannah in Hufflepuff, but that's just based on the fact that we know even less about the rest. FemHarry would still be into Quidditch, however, if Malfoy is still her nemesis, he would get a lot of ribbing over his obsession over a girl. Alternatively, FemHarry gets "adopted" by Katie Bell since they are the youngest girls in the sport and there is no gender barrier this time.
