How about this then:

Someone in FemHarry's world does some ritual in the hope of bringing Voldemort back, yet all the ritual achieves is to throw FemHarry into the canon universe.

Going by your goal, you basically want FemHarry to be OotP Tonks a few years younger. And that would actually fit your "drinking, tattoos and bad attitude" goal. Scratch the part where she goes back and instead focus on how such a FemHarry would screw over the canon universe. She has no way back, no friends or family (Sirius disappeared, Lupin avoiding responsibility, the Potters dead), basically the perfect setup for a YOLO mentality.

Since you want angst, the easiest way is the disconnect between her and who had been her friends in the original universe. Which leads to feeling alone, drinking, getting tattoos and so on.
