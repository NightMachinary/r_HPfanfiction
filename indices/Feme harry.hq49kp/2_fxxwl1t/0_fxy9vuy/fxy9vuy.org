Thank you, I happned to be an angsty writer who loves putting trauma in my work The thing is, harry was supposed to be sent in a version of herself where she no longer spoiled and such, but due to the rules of magic and gods, she merged with her baby alternate self and kinda redid her life with no memory of being the spoiled child of the potters

While she is not a loving and lovable person, has a mountain of weaknesses and also being emotionally stunned from the shit she went through, I still fear overpowering her
