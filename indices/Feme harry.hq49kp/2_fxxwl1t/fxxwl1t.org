I'm sensing a plot I might be into. Is Harry also in this universe where her parents are dead?

Regarding your question, I've a story that's goes along those lines a bit, and had been accused of my fem!Harry approaching Mary Sueness during the early chapters. You need to identify what her weaknesses are and then write them in.

It's important that your main character not win all their encounters and conflicts. Remember that in real life failure is the best teacher, so a good strategy is to set up minor victories and major defeats early on leading up to the climactic conflict.

That way the victory (if it ends in victory) is so much sweeter in light of all their previous failures and as a result of their resilience.

I really do think that having these type of plot milestones should naturally give rise to character flaws if you keep in mind that every failure should result from one or more character flaw(s), and through these experiences, your characters should, while not being perfect, manage to put everything together well enough to eek out success because they've either eradicated or just withstood their flaws.

Tl;dr: if you make your character lose sometimes, their failures prevent them from being a Mary Sue.
