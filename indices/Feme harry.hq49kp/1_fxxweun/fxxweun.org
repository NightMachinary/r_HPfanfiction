I'm wary of anything that sets up Dumbledore to be an easy target of blame. Also you should have some reason for the reader to sympathize with the character. Skipping over all the trials that make her 'tough' would be cheating the process of character growth and therefore not create the bond of reader empathy.

I mean, take it from Neville's perspective. Magdelene Potter the beautiful spoiled brat falls into a hole. Compared to his quests, that's just the end of some background noise. She comes back, acting all punk, goth, damaged, or whatever and hinting that she could help him if he worked hard to crack her Snape-like spiny exterior. "Yeah, no thanks. Go be drunk somewhere, preferably out of my way."
