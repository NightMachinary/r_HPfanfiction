Well, that's the thing, I'm still working on it. I want at least a couple of chapters before I post anything, just so I have some lee way when it comes to more later down the line. I mainly posted this so I could get some more opinions on the matter and I'm mainly mapping out the plot rn, at least the broad strokes of it. So when I am finished and I posted a couple of chaps I'll come back and link it. As for right now I need like another week or two. It's my first fic and I want to see it done to at least an above average level.
