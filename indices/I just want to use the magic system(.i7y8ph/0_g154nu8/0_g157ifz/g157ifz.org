I agree. Canon implies all sorts of laws of magic, and students write long essays about how magic works, but we don't actually see what those rules are, save one or two. Therefore as an author you can make them roughly whatever you want, and as long as you don't directly contradict canon it'll count as canon-compliant-ish. And if you don't care about canon compliance, then do whatever you want -- it's fanfic not structural engineering.
