I agree, the canon magic system is versatile, but only for hp. Maybe the word limiting is the wrong word, but I still feel it has potential to be even more and that's what the author did in his fic. In marvel almost all sorcerers and wizards don't use wands or staffs unless it's to amplify the effect. In â€˜Core Threads' Harry is able to send his own magic into different materials and shape them to his will and it lasts forever . Changing the materials the way he does it isn't transfiguration because it's stays. No wizard in canon is able to use pure magic. I just feel that the magic system in strictly hp is versatile like you said. I just don't feel the same about other fandoms.
