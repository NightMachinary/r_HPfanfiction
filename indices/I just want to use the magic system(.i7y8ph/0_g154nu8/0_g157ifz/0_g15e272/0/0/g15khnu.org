Ok I feel I'm starting to understand your point. My mind is making more connections with the abilities described in the fic, and I can see almost entirely how the systems of magic used in other strictly hp and more canon fics could be used to describe, at the very least, most of the abilities shown. I think it really just comes down to the wandless aspect and the way the magic is described in the fic. Like when I think of canon hp or even some other fics, I feel the magic is described in such a lifeless way and â€˜Core Threads', instead of doing that, plays better to my interests and imagination.
