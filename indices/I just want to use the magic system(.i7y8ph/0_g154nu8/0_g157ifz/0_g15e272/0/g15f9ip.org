I would counter than transfiguration being temporary is /not/ canon (or rather, not explicitly canon), and you could well interpret things Dumbledore does in HBP as using 'pure magic'. That's kind of the beauty of it: Harry could have easily had a Transfiguration class or many classes about sending magic into objects to shape them to his will, and Canon would pass over it for more passages about Harry being mad at Snape or something. Or had to write a long History of Magic essay about "great wizards" that used "pure magic", and got bored and unsuccessfully asked Hermione to finish it before reluctantly bs-ing it last minute ("Binns doesn't read them anyway"). It's pretty open-ended.
