You write so many stories, I wouldn't know how to keep up! I may be wrong, but I also vaguely remember that story was originally meant to be short and sweet anyway. Any extra was a pure treat. As a terrible FF writer who is actually working on her first original novel, I find the former much more difficult to write. I sympathize completely. Thank you for sharing your gift, it makes me sad when readers rip apart writers who literally do this just for the joy of it. Takes some of that joy out of it when unappreciative readers do that. ðŸ’›ðŸ’›
