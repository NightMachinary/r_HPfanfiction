Yes and no. You'd need a pretty big downside to using it (eg. it permanently uses up part of your magical core/energy) because otherwise everyone would use it all the time, and thus the Killing Curse becomes irrelevant. Perhaps make it so that after 10 or so uses, it essentially renders you a squib. It needs to have a disincentive otherwise everyone would just use it immediately.
