Potentially. But remember, the “difficult to master” Patronus Charm was mastered by a group of student who were generally 15 or 16 years old. And that a 13 year old, albeit a very powerful one, casted it as well. Simply calling it “difficult to master” doesn't seem good enough to me. It has to have some physical disincentive to me.
