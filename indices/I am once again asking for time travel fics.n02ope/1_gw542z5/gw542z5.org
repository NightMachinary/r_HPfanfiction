I read an amazing one recently where Snape goes back to Maurader's era and fixes everything. OK- I'm generally not a big Snape shipper (although I love Severitus)- and this DOES end up with a relationship between Snape & Sirius- but it is SOOO good!! Highly recommended, easily my fave “back in time” fic.
