Wow these all look really good! Thank you for your recommendations. I admit I am a bit wary of marauders era fics just because they cause me so much emotional pain, but these look like fics I could get behind. Your fic of Harry/death is definitely something I've never specifically seen before, so I'll be sure to check it out!
