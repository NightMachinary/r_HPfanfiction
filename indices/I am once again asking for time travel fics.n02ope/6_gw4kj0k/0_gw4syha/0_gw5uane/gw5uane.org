You probably meant Tsume Yuki's Harry as Sirius' brother fic. There are two similar fics: the original one - Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is by Tsume Yuki, which is finished and not that long; and the one mentioned above, inspired by Tsume Yuki's work, but it is much longer, with more world-building, and a WIP.
