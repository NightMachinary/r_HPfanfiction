I absolutely adored Harry as Sirius and Regulus' older brother, I'm sure I've read that fic a thousand times! I've read the turning of the times and was surprised to like it as I'm really quite anti Snape. The founders one looks interesting as it's really rare to get time travel fics outside of Tom riddle or the maurauders eras. I'll give the three sisters a try with an open mind but I'm not sure how it'll go. Thanks for the recommendations!
