Ah, I was going to suggest "The Three Sisters" by mumuinc, but nevermind, since it's Female Harry (really worth it though, I'm squealing over it haha). [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29799375/chapters/73309881]]. I really suggest you give it a try! It's both light-hearted and dark by moments (canon level). Holly Potter is attacked at the Dursleys, and her aunt sacrifies herself to protect her. Holly then accidentally wakes up in the past, in her 11 yo body, and is found by her mother and aunt, both children.

Have you read "The Turning of Times"? [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10413771/chapters/22996143]]. Don't really remember much, haven't finished it yet. There's a lot of world building, and Harry strikes up a friendship with Snape. Obviously, Harry's in 1975-1976.

There's also "The Heir of House Black" by ravenclawblues. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20459714/chapters/48544922]]. Harry is Master of Death, and after a few deaths, he can't go back to his time, but he wants to prevent his family from getting killed, so he accepts to go to the past. Surprise, he's reborn as Sirius' and Regulus' prodigious older brother, and h'es very protective.

And finally, "Strange Visitors from Another Century" by Izzyaro. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/519887]]. Harry, Ron, and Hermione find themselves 1000 years in the past, and they must find a way back to their time. Fluff, dark and gruesome battles.
