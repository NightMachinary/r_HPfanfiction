Hello! There have been some really good recommendations here.

There's a completed Drarry series on Ao3 called 'Do It All Over Again', told from Draco's perspective. He time travels prior to first year to begin mending his relationship with Harry, as he believes that this will ensure his future survival. I really enjoyed this series because it touched on a lot of realistic conversations between characters, mental health issues, insecurities and the realistic portrayal of trauma.

There was also an uncompleted 'Harry is a Black' reincarnation fic on fanfiction.net, which I've forgotten the name of. I know it's not time travel, but Harry is reincarnated into an alternate reality, as ten year old wizard, where this reality's Harry survived Godric's Hollow only to die in a car crash at five. Harry poses as Sirius's illegitimate son and legally gets him out of Azkaban. He mingles with other Black family members and it gets quite political towards the end. If anyone knows this fic, you're welcome to comment :)))
