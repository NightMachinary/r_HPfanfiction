Lighthearted time travel? There is nothing better than In the Bleak Midwinter by TheLoud.

Spoilers for the first chapter: Hermione travels back in time to raise a few weeks old Tom Riddle to be better. Looking for support, she knocks on the door of Tom's father, who then takes very well to the wizard of world (despite the trauma from Merope's abuse).

Told from the perspective of Tom's father.
