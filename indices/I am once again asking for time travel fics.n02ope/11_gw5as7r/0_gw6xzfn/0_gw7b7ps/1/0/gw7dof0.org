I see it recommended all the time but I didn't give it a try until last week. I ended up bingeing a lot of it in one day but for some reason I didn't really continue after that ðŸ˜… I think it's well-written but there are some things that I just personally am not that into, like a lot of OCs and a Harry who doesn't really feel like canon Harry (which is understandable given what he's been through and how the story started diverging from canon summer of OotP but I prefer a Harry more similar to canon).
