I actually have an AU 5th year story with an original prophecy, which is entirely different from Trelawney's. I haven't posted the prophecy chapter itself yet (full disclosure there), but it's written out and coming shortly. The whole story is written actually, and I'm posting a couple chapters a week, so the whole thing will be up fairly soon. I'd definitely love to know if you think it works as a good story element, if you'd like to check it out! I do hope it does.

When a devastating attack on Hogwarts causes Harry to switch places with his on-screen counterpart, Daniyel Bluelake, Harry is thrown into an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is just a fantasy. His job? Acting. Meanwhile, Daniyel will discover what it truly means to be a wizard as he learns to separate the magical fantasy world he's always known from its dark reality. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, Dan's happy days at Hogwarts are certainly numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. But what can Dan do, in Harry's place? And how high will the cost be... to switch them back?
