I had a Goblin seer who picked up on the same prophecy as Trelawney, but it took on a slightly different meaning when translated into the Goblin language. Basically, when writing that chapter, I took the original prophecy and ran it through google translate. English to German to Hindi to Chinese to English, and then I put it back into the typical format. Enough changed to make it plausible.

(I also have a second prophecy in play as well, but haven't revealed it in full)
