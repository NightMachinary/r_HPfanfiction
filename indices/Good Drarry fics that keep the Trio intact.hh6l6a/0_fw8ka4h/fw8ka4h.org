You should probably post this at [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]]!

Pretty much all of the Drarry fics I've read have had Ron and Hermione as Harry's friends but not playing a major role. In linkao3(you've got the antidote for me), they actually become Draco's friends before Harry does. In linkao3(Running on Air; Tea and No Sympathy; Nearly Lost Things, Carefully Tended; A Convenient Impracticality; Coffee, Cakes and Doorknob Snakes) I can remember Ron and Hermione having an at least notable presence but they're far from major characters.
