A key element is that I've never really visualized the characters in "live-action", with a few exceptions. I mostly see them in a detailed illustration style, similar to that of the original Grandpré illustrations --- which is not to say, mind you, that I see the characters with Grandpré's designs; but that's the kind of style I go with. Sometimes more realistic, sometimes more cartoony, depending on the character.

Of course, some of these designs I have in my head are influenced somewhat by the movies --- same for the voices, actually; Voldemort definitely sounds like Ian Hart's /PoS/ Voldemort in my head --- but they also draw from a variety of other sources. Sometimes it's fanart depictions I liked; [[https://www.deviantart.com/makani/art/Leaky-s-Widget-pics-46664400][a lot of this awesome artpiece]] ended up in my headcanon, and [[https://www.deviantart.com/marshmeellow/art/Hermione-Granger-574977327][this Hermione]] is just about perfect, although I imagine her hair a brighter shade of brown; ditto for [[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/parsel/images/3/3c/D9507bdac328af95dcb0365bbcd81971--bad-boys-exhibitions.png/][this Ron]].

And sometimes it's just details I made up myself. Growing tired of not finding any art that /quite/ matched how I've always mentally seen Voldemort, I eventually [[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/parsel/images/d/d9/LordVoldemort.png/revision/latest?cb=20171210165953][drew him myself]].
