I actually have real trouble with this.

Adult characters are easy. The main characters as twenty or thirty year olds would take me five minutes to find someone that I can go 'yeah, that's how I see Harry/Ron/Hermione'.

Kids or teenagers? Nope. No clue. What on earth does an eleven year old even look like? Child actors, especially those who've been in at least one thing a year between ten and eighteen are rare enough that it's hard to find one who can fit into the mental picture I've got to fill out the rest of it. So unless I want to go with the movie version, trying to figure out what the trio looked like on the first day of Hogwarts vs at the Yule Ball vs after the final battle is pretty hard.

Funnily enough though, a lot of the movies' secondary and supporting characters work perfectly well for me.
