Depending on the character, I end up doing one of the following:

- Picture the movie representation of them (The Golden Trio, Dumbledore, and various other characters with major movie representation with clear and distinct features)
- Picture a self-constructed, but consistent, image, based on descriptions across fics, for characters who has a habit of playing major roles in fics I generally read (Marauder-era Severus and Lily), or ones with a very pronounced description that movies fail to fulfill (Nymphadora)
- Visualize something on the fly based on the fic I'm reading's description of said character, if fics have a hard time agreeing on one consistent representation (Daphne), or simply not explaining it in first place (some OCs)

The same rules apply for locations -- a one-off location in some fic is not going to get a consistent visual representation over time for me, but Hogwarts look like the movies and the Cokeworth surroundings (park, the living spaces of the Snapes and to a lesser extent the Evanses) have a consistent fic-agnostic representation due to how often I read fics set in the area.

I always visualize them as looking like real people, as in, not "anime-style" or similar.
