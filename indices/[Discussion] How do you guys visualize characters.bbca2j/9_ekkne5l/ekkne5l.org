When I imagine them, I go plain after the book descriptions. Sometimes, I look up some fan art to see artists' interpretation of the characters.

Photographs don't help me a lot because while reading I hardly concentrate on how exactly they would look like in real life. Simple drawn art is enough for me.

e.g. when I imagine Harry I always see his wild black hair that stands up in every direction, green eyes, his scar and glasses. The rest is just fuzzy.
