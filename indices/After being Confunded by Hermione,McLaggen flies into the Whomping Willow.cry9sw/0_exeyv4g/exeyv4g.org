Her left hand flew to cover her open mouth. Shock was etched into her face, with regret slowly filling in behind the wide pupils of her eyes. Bile was starting to bubble into her throat as she saw McLaggen's body twist and contour into an unnatural position from the tree's branches.

She took two steps down on the bleachers before dropping to her knees and vomiting over the weather wooden benches. Her body shook rapidly as her stomach clenched trying to ride of nonexistent food. After a few minutes of dry heaving, she was able to look up from her sick.

Around the Whomping Willow were several fliers. Harry had risked himself to save McLaggen. It was too late, though. His body had become a tangled mess of blood, bone, and organs leaking out. She could hear sobs and screams from the new fliers around the tree.

Harry was attempting to hide the body from onlookers with little success. Ginny had flow around and started to hex anyone who ventured to close. Ron and several others had gotten off their brooms and were using their robes as a curtain to hide the scene.

McGonagall was running down the wet grass with Snape, Pomphrey, and Dumbledore following closely behind. They quickly ran past the line of students holding robes, dropping to their knees at the mangled body. There was no saving him, Hermoine concluded with snot and tears running down her face. There was so much magic could do but this? This couldn't be fixed even with the darkest and unholiest of spells.

She couldn't hear what Harry had said but she had been able to guess when the teachers all snapped their attention to her. Snape and McGonagal had stormed toward her crumbled form on the bleachers. She was in such a state of shock that they had to hook their hands under her arms and drag her back to the castle. Her feet had followed uselessly behind her as she passed the body.

Oh, god.

/She was a murder./

Part of her mind was trying to justify that it was an accident! She didn't mean for him to get hurt. She didn't know he would veer into the murderous tree. She didn't know!

But she couldn't say anything as Harry followed yelling at Dumbledore about the tree. He screamed about how if the man didn't encourage such lenient behavior to his friend she might have thought before acting. How he should have known she didn't regard a person's life after setting Snape on fire first year.

That had Snape digging his fingers into her upper arm painfully.

She turned around one last time before being dragged into the castle. She had hoped to see the body. A punishment, she thought looking for the mangled mess. All she caught was the enraged and murderous face of her best friend.

"You always preach about rules, yet, you think they don't apply to you," He spat, "You went too far."

He was right. She had.

Her opinion of how she could do no wrong turned her into a killer.
