This was written exceedingly well!

I'm currently writing a series and the theme is based on fate vs. choice as well as reincarnation. Hermione is such an interesting character and she's one of the harder one's to write for me (along with Snape, and Dumbledore). I want to be as true to her as I can get but also, give her the consequences for her (and others) actions that they deserve... The interesting thing about the Hermione I'll be writing, is that due to the reincarnation, she has a stronger self awareness that she doesn't in canon?

Basically some of her past life experiences have made her aware of how easy it is to cross a line and never come back from it... My point is, your piece has given me some inspiration!üòä‚ù§
