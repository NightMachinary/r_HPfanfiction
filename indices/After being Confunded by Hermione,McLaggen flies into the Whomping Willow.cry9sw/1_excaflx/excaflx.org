"Professor McGonagall, I know who did it." Harry said to the unusually somber professor. "It was Hermione. She overheard McLaggen talking trash coupled with her crush on Ron..."

"Be as that may be, that does not excuse her actions in the slightest. Where did we go wrong?"

Harry, annoyed with everyone this year, snapped. "Maybe it's because you've been coddling her too much. Maybe it's because she's got this idea that anything she does is alright because it's for the greater good. Despite her being an excellent student, she keeps hearing how she's the brightest person of her age and has internalized the hype. Maybe it's because you're such a shitty head of house and administrator. You gave her a time turner to take more classes, confiscated a broom on her testimony alone, and most of all, do nothing. She scarred Marietta as a supposed measure to stop snitching, but never told anyone. I admit I thought it was justified at first, but she doesn't remember anything, and she would have never told otherwise. You let her be vindictive, but oh, she's a model student. She's easily broken more rules than Ron or I. I could see her one of these days attacking someone outright for doing something she didn't like. Yet, see that, you do nothing at all."

Harry paused, gathering more steam. "She isn't the only one you've failed. You left me at the Dursleys. I had a cupboard for a room for 10 years. 10 years I endured, all because you were too much of a coward to do anything. So yes, this is partially your fault. You, who does nothing."

Part 2 with Hermione coming in the afternoon.
