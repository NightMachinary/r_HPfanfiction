“For causing the death of Cormac McLaggen, you are hereby expelled from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As your wand was used in the crime, it has been submitted as evidence to the DMLE.”

Professor McGonagall looked like she was in mourning. Dumbledore looked like he swallowed a particularly bitter lemon. The aurors looked on neutrally.

Hermione was in hysterics. “It was just an accident... I didn't mean to.”

McGonagall replied back. “It's because you disregarded another student's safety for your own selfish desires. I mean really, where's your integrity? Confunding a student just so your crush would be guaranteed the spot. It's shameful.”

Hermione had no reply. The aurors came and took her through the floo, to await her trial and sentencing.
