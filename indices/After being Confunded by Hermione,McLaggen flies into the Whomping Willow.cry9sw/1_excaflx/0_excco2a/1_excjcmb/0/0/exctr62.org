I just wanted to make a trilogy joke.

And I'm a bit kinder to Dumbledore than his canon actions deserve, because Rowling meant for him as a flawed, but good man, and you see that often.

Snape on the other hand, is actively a dick. I liked the two fics I've read that used his movie personality, because it really is more nuanced, but people take it too far.
