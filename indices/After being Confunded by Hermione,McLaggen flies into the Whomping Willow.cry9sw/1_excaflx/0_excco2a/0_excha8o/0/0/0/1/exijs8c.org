There is Amortentia by excentrymuse, which deals with it very well. Although McLaggen doesn't die, it just goes as in canon, until she's found out. It's a very interesting Harry/Romilda with a slightly OOC Harry (more intelligent and less moody).

It's been removed, but I have it saved. It's kind of easy to find.
