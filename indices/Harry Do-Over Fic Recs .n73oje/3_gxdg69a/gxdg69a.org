I really love the characters and how Harry sets out to be a better friend in Nightmares of Futures Past. It's always heartwarming to reread it and see how he's working to boost Neville's confidence, open Ron's eyes to how great it is to have a family, really support Hermione's drive to excel, and bring Ginny and Luna into his circle of friends at the first opportunity.

Unfortunately incomplete and you can't get it from FFN, but there's a PDF [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/download/2.2.1/hpnofp-v2.2.1.pdf][on GitHub]].
