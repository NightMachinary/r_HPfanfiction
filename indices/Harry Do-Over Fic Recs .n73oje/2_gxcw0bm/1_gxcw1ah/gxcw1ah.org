  Albus Dumbledore concocts a desperate plan to send Severus back to his last year at Hogwarts and save the Wizarding World from its future fate. What could go wrong? (Certainly not a budding relationship with the person he hated most in the world, nor being thrust into a position of power within the Order of the Phoenix.)

My sister---““---is dead, little muggle,” said Bellatrix. “As will you if you do not give us Potter.”Holly's heart constricted for the space of half a heartbeat. Aunt Petunia did not want her. She'd gotten Uncle Vernon killed. She'd brought the war to their doorstep. She'd---“Over my dead body, you stupid witch!” Aunt Petunia gasped, her arms convulsively twitching around Holly's shoulders, her nails digging into her skin. “You've killed my sister, my husband... I---I won't let you kill my niece too!”Bellatrix laughed loudly, a loud maniacal cackle that seemed to fill Holly's world with fire and brimstone. “On your head be it. Avada Kedavra!”

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Updates once every two to three weeks. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

  How would things have been if Harry had got to know Snape and his Snakes better? A 'Harry in Slytherin' story. Don't groan; it's not that bad! Warnings: mention of sex later on (very mild); typical teenage swearing (mild) and corporal punishment (not graphic or extreme). (Note: the beginning is heavily inspired by Asterix Tutnix.)
