There was one that took place in 4th year where Harry refused to participate in the tournament and instead created his own school. Barty had to attend the tournament instead lest he lose his magic, and he disguised himself as Harry and then died in the first task. McGonagall became the headmistress of Harrys new school and they had Sirius, Lupin and the grangers as teachers too.

Cant remember the name now though
