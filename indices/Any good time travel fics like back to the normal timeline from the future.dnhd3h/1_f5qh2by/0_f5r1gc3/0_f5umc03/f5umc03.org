Yeah, no. It didn't convey any of that. In fact, it didn't actually convey anything at all, because it was wholly incomprehensible.

That said, what you're looking for is called a Peggy Sue fic, and they are fairly popular. Harry Potter and teh Wastelands of Time is probably the best known of the genre, but there's a whole bunch of them listed [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotterPeggySue][here]], and even more on this sub- search for the phrase "Peggy Sue" or "Time travel."
