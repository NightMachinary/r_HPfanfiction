Okay like this Normally Harry went on to do all the stuff he normally did in the series and in like 2010 He is like ”okay this is boring in going to go back in time” and he goes to like maybe a bit before school starts and he of course knows everything already from the previous tile He did it, the time travel could also be with another person (maybe his loved one idk) and then Harry (and the people who know of it) do like a mini speedrun of the whole thing and destroy voldemort in about 10 days worth of time
