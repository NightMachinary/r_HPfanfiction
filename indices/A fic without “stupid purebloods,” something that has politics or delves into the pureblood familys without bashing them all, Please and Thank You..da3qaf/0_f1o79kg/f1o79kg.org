Linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) has a semi-positive view of Pureblood culture and traditions. Harriet doesn't agree with some of their positions (blood purity being so much more aggressive in this universe is a major issue for her personally), but she is very close friends with Pansy and Draco and cordial with many of the other Slytherins.
