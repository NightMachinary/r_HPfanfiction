Another fanfiction I enjoyed about DH from different pov is "Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness". It's from Neville's POV, so we see the entire year from inside Hogwarts. But it is rather in depth and explores the story of many minor characters, so even though I really loved it, it's more of a story on its own. But it is really well written, and I couldn't say if I liked Not from Others or this one better. (and I should probably add that it has some gory scenes ;-) )
