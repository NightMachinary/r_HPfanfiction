Honestly it would make sense and be an interesting read if the Next Gen kids acted like Draco when he was young, and had to grow out of that behavior. The parents could try all they might, but constantly being hounded by reporters and adoring fans can have an effect on kids. While the reporters and fans would be focused on the Next Gen kids parents, they would garner quite a bit of attention for being the "Next Generation of Heroes" or something like that
