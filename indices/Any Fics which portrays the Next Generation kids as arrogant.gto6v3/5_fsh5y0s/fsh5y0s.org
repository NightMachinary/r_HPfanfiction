There's a oneshot where Harry is called to Hogwarts to pick up James after he's been suspended (maybe?) for bullying. Harry is furious and disappointed, but at first doesn't show any reaction and is struggling how to handle the situation without Ginny there to help. James apologizes several times, but isn't really sorry he hurt and humiliated another student, he's sorry for getting caught/being in the situation after, and it isn't until the end that he recognizes the harm he's done and really apologizes/has a bonding moment with his father.

If anyone remembers this, I'd love to read it again!
