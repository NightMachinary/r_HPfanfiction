My headcanon is basilisk fangs are biologically inclined to come out, to get as much of the leftover venom into the victim as possible. Kinda like bee stingers, except the Basilisk would just regrow its fangs instead of dying. That'd make them fairly easy to remove postmortem.

The fang comes out /way/ too easily in canon for it to be meant to stay in the snake.
