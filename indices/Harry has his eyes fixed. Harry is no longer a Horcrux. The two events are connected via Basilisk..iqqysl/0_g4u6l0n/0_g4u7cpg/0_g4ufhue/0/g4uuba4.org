It does say "splintered", but then again that just means it broke off anywhere. Stuff's interconnected in the body, doesn't mean it can't be made to break off - see also, bee stingers and salamander tails.

Harry also refers to it as the whole fang, not a splintered-off part, elsewhere in the book.

Either way, I think it's a weird bit to pick apart in this prompt.
