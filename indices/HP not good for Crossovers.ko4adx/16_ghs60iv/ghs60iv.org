It's not particularly bad, the simple fact that the wizarding world is actively and effectively concealed allow it to slot into many urban settings and magic is interesting enough to drop into another setting through plot devices like the veil or random magical transport mishaps, have your character be sufficiently moral not to abuse the unforgivables (instant death and mind control are far too effective) and magic might not even be too overpowered.
