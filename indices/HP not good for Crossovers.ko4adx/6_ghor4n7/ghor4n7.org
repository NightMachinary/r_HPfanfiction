Uh there is a reason why there are so many HP crossovers.\\
As previous speakers said, because it is a secret world an incredible amount is possible without the Veil of Death or the Hollows.\\
For example there are a lot of Avengers / Marvel crossovers or the ASoIaF / GoT as mentioned.\\
There are also good Star Wars crossovers, X-Men etc. In my opinion there is no other story base with so many crossover possibilities.

P.S. There are no good Twilight fic, crossover or the Original Books. The books alone border on a crime against humanity ".... Vampires, damn it dont glitter!" ;)
