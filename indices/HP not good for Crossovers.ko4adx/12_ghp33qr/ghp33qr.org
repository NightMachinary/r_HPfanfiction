Sure, they might take a bit of work, but if you do it right, you can make a cohesive world out of pretty much anything. I think a lot of crossovers come off a little badly because they're not overly integrated. It takes a bit of thought to really make two worlds work together, but it can be done. Just gotta find the mesh point where they integrate most easily, then work outward from there. I managed to make a Life is Strange (Telltale-type game set in a Hipster Photography School in a Twee American Fishing Village) and Dead Space (Gore and psychological horror shooter in space with a tonne of monsters made from reanimated human flesh) crossover work pretty well, for example. :D
