Loved it for avatar the last Airbender.

Zuko and the philosopher's rock was hilarious and wonderfully written. I enjoyed book one but stopped after that for no fault on the crossover. It was just such a massive shame the author insisted on crossing it over with... tinkerbell (?) At the end if book 1 that turned me off.
