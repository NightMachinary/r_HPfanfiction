I would argue quite the opposite. Between the Veil of Death giving a perfect excuse to throw people into alternate realities, the title of Master of Death allowing for convenient summoning mishaps (or just plain immorality and simply waiting for the new setting) and Hidden Society allowing HP to slot into nearly any contemporary setting with little fuss, plausibly in-universe excuses for a crossover, virtually /any/ crossover, abound.

Then add in that HP magic is ill-defined enough and the story covers all levels of magical education, it's not terribly difficult to set up things so the crossover worlds are of similar enough power levels (or roflstomp imbalance, if desired) to make for an interesting story.

HP is very flexible from a crossover standpoint.
