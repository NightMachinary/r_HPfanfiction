I think it depends on the author's skill. I've read and loved a Naruto crossover - and I've never watched/read Naruto in my life. (I'm not even sure if it's an anime or manga.) I have also read a helluva lot of bad crossovers. Maybe it's trickier to cross over HP with another fandom, but it can be done well.
