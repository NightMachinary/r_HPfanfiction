I'm writing a HP/Warcraft crossover that I think ties them together rather well. One of the ways I'm welding the worlds together is that the warcraft magic users generally have a lot more power, living on a world with so much more magic in the air/ley-lines than Earth.

On the other hand, Harry's civilization has had to work with a lot less power, so their spells are much more efficient. They've explored much more of the powers of magic that require a gentle/light touch.

I'm also using the idea that overwhelming magical power can be countered to a point with overwhelming control. (Voldemort was stronger than Dumbledore, but Albus had extremely fine control over his spells.)

Basically, in chapter 4, a guy from Warcraft takes a look around and starts thinking "But what if I mix and match these styles of magic together?"

Crossovers can work with HP, but you have to find a good way to sew the worlds together. Or, just dump HP in another universe. (Or vice-versa.)
