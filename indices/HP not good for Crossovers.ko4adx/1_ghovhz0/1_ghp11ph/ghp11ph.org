One thing I really enjoy about Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past (not a crossover) is that although Harry is personally very powerful, with oversized magic and years of brutal experience of warfare - it rarely matters in the story. It's about him reconnecting with his friends, preparing them, and building a better life for when they succeed. The characters are really interesting, and there isn't a whole lot of direct combat. Even when there /is/ combat, it's typically overshadowed by the people; the first time we see Harry really get into a fight, it's a curb stomp, but that doesn't matter because the focus of the scene is reconnecting with Sirius, whom he just rescued. Fighting the basilisk is also short, but more importantly, it's done as a team.

Any setting can work, it's about how the author handles it.
