  It always seems to be laser focused on the idea that the settings need to be balanced in terms of their power, which is just... what? Why?
#+end_quote

I think that comes from an overemphasis of "there must be conflict" in a story, combined with people thinking that conflict can only arise from a power imbalance.

Heck, a power imbalance can be a conflict in itself. I personally love a good power imbalance!

(Also, just because you can blow someone up, it doesn't make a romantic relationship with them any easier or harder.)

And very much lastly:

  Even in a non-crossover story, 'adventurer Harry defeating foes and taking names' is still only one plot concept
#+end_quote

Even with that, I love myself a good curbstomp. It's just plain fun to see (from one story I remember) Harry and Ginny absolutely dominating the Helm's Deep Battle with some preparation. It's /fun/ to imagine being a badass hero sometimes, even if things go mostly right!

The conflict then arises from "what happened the last time I saw this?", and not from "what is happening right now," that juxtaposition can be a conflict and interesting.

This is why fanfiction is a different genre. Just like in romance you don't need a power struggle, you don't need one in fanfiction. Write to the strength of your genre!
