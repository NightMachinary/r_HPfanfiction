Honestly, I don't think I will ever understand this opinion.

It always seems to be laser focused on the idea that the settings need to be balanced in terms of their power, which is just... what? Why? If that was the case the /only/ crossovers which would be viable would be the completely ordinary settings/characters. As soon as you add powers or magic or high technology to the mix you'll start seeing areas in which one could trump the other completely.

Lets not even get into the fact that different people have very different interpretations of just how powerful each 'setting' is. It's the old Jedi vs Wizard debate, and the answer you come to as to which of those two is more 'powerful' in a direct confrontation depends entirely on how you integrate the governing powers of the two settings. Can Force users feel and influence magic spells/powers? Can they predict magic users in a battle? You can say 'no', of course and in that case a single wizard becomes much more powerful than any single Jedi, but that was a choice that did not have to be made. You could just have easily have said 'yes' and ended up with a crossover where wizards do not effortlessly outclass Force users.

Crossovers give a lot of freedom in just how you interpret the the two settings side-by-side because there is /no/ canon which specifies to what level Magic and the Force are mutually intelligible. You can do whatever you like with it, but like with all things which the writer can chose for their story, they do have to actually chose an interpretation that /works/ for the story they want to tell.

So, yes, if you want to write a 'awesome adventurer Harry and co charge around the Star Wars universe as bounty-hunters' story, it'll be completely robbed of stakes if nothing in Star Wars can threaten them, but it is the writer's decision to make those wizards unassailable, not a fundamental property of either setting.

And honestly, the focus on power levels is just... frustrating. Who cares if Harry in Westeros is ludicrously overpowered? Don't tell that story then. Find a different story to tell. One where being able to defeat people in a straight up fight is relatively unimportant. Game of Thrones is all about where Power resides, and how it can be used. Honestly, taking that to 11 by having a fully powered Wizard still unable to lead his nation into a prosperous future due to the petty squabbles of his vassals sounds interesting. Perhaps he's able to bring prosperity to everyone in his immediate view, but as soon as they're a few thousand miles away all bets surely are off. Hell, make the magic user the villain of the story even if they're not aware of it. There's no way running around reading minds and controlling people into peaceful prosperity isn't the act of a well-meaning villain.

Even in a non-crossover story, 'adventurer Harry defeating foes and taking names' is still only /one/ plot concept. It completely ignores pretty much everything else. Romance? Mystery? Horror? All of those are much more focused on the characters and their /knowledge/ than on their ability to kill things. None of those are especially impacted by power levels.

So, in conclusion, two points:

1. Harry Potter is only 'bad' for crossovers if you constrain yourself to a single adventure plotline, and deliberately make canon extrapolations which break the crossover setting.
2. All non-mundane settings have that same issue.
