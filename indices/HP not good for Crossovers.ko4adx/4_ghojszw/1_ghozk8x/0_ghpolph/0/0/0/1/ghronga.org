#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter has no idea what to do. His new Auror recruits are nothing short of hopeless. Then an idea hits him..."So, let me get this straight: we're supposed to show some wand-waving weirdos how to do our job?""Yes, that is the general idea."Or: failing Auror recruits get dumped with MI-5 to get a lesson in how spying is really done, and with cooperating magical and Muggle terrorists on the loose, working together might just be a necessity anyway.Set in Spooks season 5 and after the Deathly Hallows, but before the epilogue of Harry Potter
