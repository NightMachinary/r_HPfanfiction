HP only got famous in the first place because of its magic and its wizarding world. The story as a whole often tends to be iffy at best and only a couple of characters stand out as good or at least interesting characters.

I do think crossovers can be done (yes even in the marvel universe). You'd just have to do so without violent conflict. The problem with doing so is that it can limit the genres of stories written. And if you throw out the magic entirely there isn't much of what made HP special in the first place left in the story.

The story can be good without magic based conflict, yes, but look how many fanfic writers are actually out there trying to write muggle AUs versus all those who only write stories that still utilize magic. Besides, if I wanted to read a story with good characters who don't use magic, I'd go read fanfics of another damn fandom. If I had issues with magic in a story I would be reading fanfics of the most famous magical story of all time.
