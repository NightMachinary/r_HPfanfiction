That's fine and dany but I don't believe in the slightest that HP would have gotten all the love it has without the magic. For HP, magic very much is the most important aspect. And that's fine. A big chunk of fans /don't/ love HP for the story but for the magic, which is A-okay.

My issue is that magic is weapon through which all significant conflicts in the HP universe are fought with. Ya can't just discount it as a factor in any story with conflicts in it. One could just have a story without conflicts but honestly that tends to heavily limit the kinds of stories told.

Hell, nearly all the stories I read (that aren't crack or humor of some sort) have violent conflict in them. Call me a simpleton or whatever, but I am just not interested in reading a story without them. And considering how many HP fics do feature battles in them, the magic is very much an important factor since it's what they use to fight.

The genres that don't heavily feature violent conflict or focus strongly on magic are very character and plot focused and tbh outside of a few exceptions HP is pretty weak on both of those fronts. Whenever I /am/ in the mood to read about good characters or a good story, HP is not the fandom I'd be looking through.
