Not really. I am thinking more about that quotation from Henry James:

  realism is what in some shape or form we might encounter, whereas romanticism is something we will never encounter.

You are still too much focused on the magic. I am thinking more in terms of the story itself. Don't think about fantasy stories at all. Consider “[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanhoe][Ivanhoe]]” by Walter Scott on the one side as a romantic story, and let's say “[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapped_%28novel%29][Kidnapped]]” by Robert Louis Stevenson. Both of them are adventure stories full of suspension and drama, both them of course completely Muggle and completely free of any magic, supernatural or whatever else. I would say that the key word which differentiates them is “*exceptional*”. Whereas “Ivanhoe” is the novel about exceptional people (Robin Hood and his merry men, king Richard the Lion Heart, king John, historic and thus exotic knights and princesses) doing exceptional things (saving the kingdom for the rightful king among other things), “Kidnapped” has the only historic event of any notice (Appin murder) in three paragraphs and it just an excuse in background for the rest of the story, which is about two completely insignificant (/sub specie aeternitatis/) persons doing something completely historically insignificant: saving their lives and freedom (and inheritance for David). Realist stories (despite the bad rap they got from /Middlemarch/, Balzac and similar stuff) don't have to be boring. I really like “[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_Mr_Polly][History of Mr Polly]]” by H. G. Wells, which is beautifully written story despite being about pub-owner mixed with a tramp and history of his unfortunate first marriage. In the same way similar good realist stories are also most detective stories (from Hercule Poirot to Law & Order), and I have also mentioned stories by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Ransome][Arthur Ransome]] (probably now mostly forgotten stories about children and their small adventures during their holidays) or Kipling's “[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalky_%26_Co.][Stalky & Co.]]”, the last one I think has to have some influence on JKR.

All fantasy novels and comics are in this perspective romantic stories, because all those Supermans, Batmans, Conans, etc., and the least problem they are willing to care for is saving of the whole world, nothing less. Harry Potter books are about saving the world from the potential evil overlord, true, but it is remarkable how incredibly normal (in good sense of the word) all characters are (with exception of Tom Riddle and Dumbledore). JKR managed brilliantly avoid [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/the-problem-of-peter-pevensie-and-the-problem-of-wands.html][The Problem of Peter Pevensie]] and the positive part of the incredibly convoluted resolution of the story (yes, the thing about the wand ownership is pure /deus ex machina/ pulled out the author's hat in the last few chapters of the book) is that in the end Harry is slightly battered, certainly more experienced, but quite distinctly seventeen year old young man, drop-out after the sixth year of Hogwarts, not a superhero.

It is obvious how much worse most super!Harry and crossovers with Marvel stories and similar end up, because they obviously didn't catch this difference (this atmosphere is perfectly kept by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] and it is one of reasons why his stories are so good, or for example stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mzzbee/pseuds/mzzbee][mzzbee]]). It is also the reason how all Lord Potter stories fair poorly, because Harry Potter books and its characters are quite clearly middle class, inhabited by small businessmen, bureaucrats etc., not lords and ladies.

Good crossovers with Harry Potter are possible, but not with Marvel universe, but with very down to the earth and “realistic” stories (e.g., “Operation Wandless by EllianaDunla” linkao3(784221), which is mostly just a crime/espionage story crossed with “[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spooks_(TV_series][Spooks]])”) or perhaps with Sherlock Holmes stories.
