So, you're saying that Harry Potter is low fantasy and doesn't mix well with high fantasy, right? Instead type of world that naturally exist in fantasy stories (kingdoms, knights, elves, etc.), the story takes place in a modern time and world. Even the high fatasy elements that are present (dragons, elves and so on) are held back by modern influence (dragons only live on dragon reserves taken care of by handlers, the wizarding world isn't part of a kingdom but instead run by a corrupt government with elected officials, people learn magic at schools and take exams, etc.).

Tbh, I think that's more to do with the feel of the story. Obviously, there are going to be clashes in the different vibes the two worlds give the reader but that's mostly because of the unique vibe the HP world has. Ignoring the magic fight issue, I think the story can work well enough if the writer is willing to let go of the feeling that the wizarding world has in vanilla HP (and if the reader is willing to forgive the absence of that feeling) and just ignore the fact that the story doesn't feel quite the same as vanilla HP.

So, the magic fight thing doesn't work in universe. While the high/low fantasy thing doesn't work from meta perspective.
