What I mean is that the problem is much deeper and substantial than just type of magic (which is of course problem as well), that there is a difference between romantic and realist literature, and that Harry Potter (and the best fanfiction stories, e.g., Northumbrian ones) is more realist literature with magic than the romantic one (and that most fantasy literature is heavy romantic one). I have written about it [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/magicians-realism.html][on my blog]], so I think my argument would be much longer than what I would write in this stupid comment block.
