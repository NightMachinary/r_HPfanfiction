Are you saying that HP is just real world stuff with magic added to the mix?

Also, I think the magic does matter quite a bit if the crossover story is going to have violent conflicts. Unless they're willing to convert to HP magic, the second universe in the Xover is very likely to have a really tough time of it if one HP spell can end them.

The best thing for the story would be to take this out of the equation by not having many fights.
