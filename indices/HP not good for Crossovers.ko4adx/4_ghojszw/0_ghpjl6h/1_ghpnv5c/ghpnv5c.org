I'm sure a good author could but I feel that's part of the problem. It not impossible to make a good crossover story with HP, but given how difficult it is to write a good one, I think that fact speaks for itself that HP is generally a shitty choice of a crossover world. Decent crossover story with HP is if the fights aren't really that important to the story.

Now, I've never read either of those two stories but in the second one it still sounds like any SW character would lose in a landslide to any half decent wizard.
