Interesting piece, and you're right, but I think good authors could still write a decent crossover.

For example, two Star Wars crossovers linkffn(Havoc Side of the Force; Unsuspecting Side of the Force) come to mind. Especially in the second one, the Jedi come to some rather blatant misconceptions about the scope of Harry's power since they don't have any context about his abilities, even though they've observed him for quite some time. At some point, one Jedi Master calls him the closest thing to a God a mortal can get or some such, and Yoda states that Obi-Wan (post Phantom Menace) confronting Harry would be suicidal for him.

They're still good stories though incomplete.
