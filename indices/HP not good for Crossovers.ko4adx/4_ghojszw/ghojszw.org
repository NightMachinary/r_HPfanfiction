In terms of a magic or fight system... well, in my opinion, yeah. I made a comment a couple months back about it on another post.

  In my honest opinion, Harry Potter is generally a bad universe to crossover with. Its magic is versatile, so much so that it tops any other magic system despite it lacking the wide scale or heavy firepower that is often seen in other interpretations of magic. Its magic system only works with itself because the only enemies people have to face are also wizards. The magic the enemy uses is just as versatile as their own. The only universes I can think of that could possibly stand-up to HP would be comics, which constantly deal with characters (magical and non-magical) who can alter reality on a universal scale (characters like scarlet witch in Marvel, or the specter in DC). So vast majority, if not literally all, of the non-comics crossovers would get their shit kicked in pretty easily.

  Part of the reason HP magic is so versatile is that HP magic is trivialized, its usage has become such a massive part of their daily lives that they constantly use it for the most minor of things. It's rarely, if ever, portrayed as some mysterious cosmic force that they manipulate as opposed to something like the force in Star Wars, something that, while it isn't magic, still feels a lot more mystical in-universe than the way HP magic is portrayed.

  HP magic is used freely, for even the smallest of things, and because it's used for almost everything with generally very little difficulty or consequences, it can just do more than any other magic system you can find. This is a bad thing for crossovers, because their magic will never be as versatile as HP and the only way for them to keep up is to learn HP magic. Which destroys a significant part of the reason in making a crossover in the first place.

  At least, thats my opinion.

So, that's it. They can do near anything and getting hit with even a single spell can be crippling (jelly legs spell and that's if you want it to be painless) or immediately fatal (even without using the killing curse).
