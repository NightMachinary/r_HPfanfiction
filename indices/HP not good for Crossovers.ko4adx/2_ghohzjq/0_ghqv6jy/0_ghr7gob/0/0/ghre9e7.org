I haven't read the magnus series, so I'm going off PJ and the one after, but if I'm remembering correctly, PJ is one of the strongest and I have a hard time believing he can cut down Dumbledore or Riddle.

And the thing is wizards can simply defend until demigods run out of power. Even if divine weapons can deflect, how long can an exhausted one swing a sword against someone with unlimited power?
