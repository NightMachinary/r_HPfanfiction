The issue here is speed. The strongest demigods can cut down a wizard before they finish a spell. I personally believe that the divine weapons such as celestial bronze could block or deflect standard spells. But of course a good wizard can be way more versatile and use aoe or transfiguration.

That said it comes back to speed, iirc percy has arrow timing feats.
