I feel certain fandoms cross over very nicely without much effort. For example Harry Potter cross over with Warcraft 3, Song of Ice and Fire/Game of thrones are really easy to set up because how well the fit together. ON the other hand it really doesnt fit with Mass Effect or even Naruto.

Also High School DxD can be used to fit any crossover from almost anywhere. List of my favourite Crossover fandoms for Harry Potter

- Warcraft
- GoT
- DxD
- Stargate
- Star wars
