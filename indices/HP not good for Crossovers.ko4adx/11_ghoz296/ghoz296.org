I wrote about it [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-dorothy-sayers.html][on my blog]]. I think it is not specifically problem of crossovers generally, but what do you want to crossed it with. I mention two cross-over stories which work reasonably well, and from the top of my head I can remember “Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of the Seventh Safeguard by Charlotte Ann Kent” linkffn(12447494), which works reasonably well as well.
