Are the two that immediately came to mind mainly because I did a quick check because of the potential issues with hpfanficarchive. I would have to go through my delete folder on my computer to identify others (maybe 4-6 others) because I immediately discard the old version.

I'm currently "following" roughly 268 stories which I consider "updateable" eg updated within 2 years. I basically check for updates once every other month or so.

I have another 382 stories that I consider abandoned updated more than 2 years ago. I typically check them once a year to see if they get updated.
