A bunch of reasons. Firstly Hogwarts, the classes aren't huge, chances are, if they marry someone within a few years of age then they've known each other for years. Harry is the exception rather than the rule with how anti-social he is. Population size is a factor, if you're going to marry another magical rather than muggle, chances are you met them already. JKR maths is off, we all know that, but if you marry domestically in HP to another magical there is a very high chance you met them at Hogwarts. Compare that to how couples meet in our world. There are millions of us muggles in each country. Its one of the reasons I'm not a big fan of stories that imply all of Hogwarts was getting off in broom closets. Everyone knows everyone and everyone knows who did what with whom. Everyone is somebody's ex/cousin/best friend.

Another reason is Voldemort, people were dying, now or never was a very real pressure. Grindelwald was only a few years before him too.

Lily and James fill both of these. They knew each other and lived around each other for years. Longer than most couples are together before they get married. Then they jumped right into fighting Voldemort, people they knew were dying, they had to have known they could die any day and they wanted to make the most of what they had. Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione both fit this too, they knew each other for years they were close and then more.

Young marriages aren't a guarantee either. Tonks didn't marry right out of Hogwarts, Bill must have been nearing 30, Charlie Weasley never marries and Percy doesn't marry right out of school. Kingsley, Mundungus Fletcher and Moody are never mentioned to have married, nor are many other of the Order members. It seems those close to the central plot marry young but the rest of the Wizarding world doesn't always.
