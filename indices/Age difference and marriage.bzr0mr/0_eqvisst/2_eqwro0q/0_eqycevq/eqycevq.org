Fleur didn't even need to come to England. She supposedly came to improve her English, while the real reason was to find Bill, a dude who she saw once, and probably didn't have much interaction with (She was with her family in the day of the first task, while after the tournament she was probably in medical care due to cruciatus exposure).
