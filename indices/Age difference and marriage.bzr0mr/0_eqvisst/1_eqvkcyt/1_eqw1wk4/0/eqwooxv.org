Bull.

That figure, Armando Dippet's age, comes from an image from a limited edition box set about the making of the movies and the props used in them.

So basically, somebody making a prop for the movie put in random dates. That prop with the dates included may not have even been /in/ the movie.

That's not canon. The only things which are canon about Dippet is that he was headmaster during Tom Riddle's tenure at Hogwarts and left at some point between Lupin being bitten and Lupin turning eleven.
