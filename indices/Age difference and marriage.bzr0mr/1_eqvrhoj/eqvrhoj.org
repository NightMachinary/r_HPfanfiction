A number of reasons that I can hypothesize (in order of impact):

First, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships#Reasons_for_age_disparity][this article]] might help you understand that marriage on average favors near parity ages up to men being five years the elder, with only 10% being such a reverse of situations. Its not that common for women to be older in general, and generally rarity often makes people notice (and have problems with) such marriages.

Second, Harry and Hermione (as well as SI OCs) are to many people the character they imagine themselves as. From a societal point of view, at least in a lot of western culture, there is a not inconsiderable stigma against large age differences between men and women in relationships/marriage. Some of this is because of the possible idea of one taking advantage of the other for (often for money, e.g. "gold digger"). Thats not to say its even a common issue, but its part of the why people generally are inclined to frown on such relationships (accurate or not). Thus, people are uncomfortable with "their character" doing things they find wrong on a personal level.

Third, from a story perspective, the Bill/Fleur and Remus/Tonks situations are kind of black sheep in wizarding society. Considering that nearly every British wizard is educated at Hogwarts (for the full seven years), its likely that you are going to school with if not in the same age bracket as your future spouse(s?). More so, considering puberty and relationship interest usually kicks in around 12-14, this probably limits the number even further. Bill lived in a separate country for years, so relationships were probably difficult at best, while Remus was forced to the fringes of society with his only likely candidates probably less than reputable individuals. And, related to the first answer, both of these are also older men with younger women.

I don't see that much of a problem myself, but these seem to be the best explanations.
