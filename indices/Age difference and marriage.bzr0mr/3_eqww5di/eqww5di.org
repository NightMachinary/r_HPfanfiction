Its really skeezy to me eithery way honestly. I believe in the creepy formula. Half your age (round up) + 7 is the youngest you can date. So a 19 year old should only date down to a 17 year old and but an old person gets more leeway so a 35 year old and 25 year old is fine.

  Also why do they marry so young?

Again i personally think its fucked but,\\
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage_in_the_United_States#Age_of_participants][Well as recently as 2001 in Tennessee, three 10-year-old girls were married to men aged 24-31 Meanwhile in Alabama, a 74-year-old man married a 14-year-old girl.]] Dont worry its not sexism though: The youngest boy was an 11-year-old who married a 27-year-old woman in Tennessee in 2006.

Also since they are children they are not allowed to get a divorce since you need to be 18 to begin legal proceedings.
