Well, Remus and Tonks are, according to the laws of the wizarding world, both adults. This is /not/ the case with Harry and Fleur as of /GoF/, since (assuming that Dumbledore's comment about coming of age in "the wizarding world" applies to the wizarding community worldwide) she, at 17, is legally an adult, and he is not. There are therefore potentially unfortunate implications that are absent in the case of Remus/Tonks.
