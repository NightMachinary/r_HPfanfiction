You're right - there's no comparison in technology between the wizarding world and the muggle world.

They have no internet. They have no computers. Their information storage, search, and retrieval technology is medieval. THEY HAVE NO MEANS OF SHARING CAT VIDEOS!!!!!!

Their entertainment is limited to a few radio stations and live performances. They have no TVs, no movie theatres, no game consoles. To watch a sporting event, you have to go to it and sit in the stands.

Wizards haven't been to the moon. They haven't landed rovers on Mars. They haven't sent probes out of our solar system. They aren't working towards manned settlements on other planets.

Their weapons are slow, inaccurate, and require years of training to be used at all. They haven't harnessed the power of the atom and sun to make weapons capable of destroying whole cities nor threatened to depopulate the entire world.

Yes - James and Sirius used mirrors to talk to each other in the 70s. They are also the only people we see use them and that was limited to a single pair of mirrors. There is no worldwide network of mirrors for them to link into. Most people use owls or flue calls and neither of those match the speed and convenience of cell phones.

Some of them can teleport vast distances. Most of them can't Apparate or dislike it, dislike the spinning of portkeys, and rely on the flue network and brooms to get around.

Their rate of development is glacial in comparison to muggles. Muggles have advanced more in the last 50 years then Wizards have in the last 500.

Yes - in many ways Wizards are vastly superior. But that superiority is shrinking everyday.
