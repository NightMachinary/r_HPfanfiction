  The Wizarding World is often viewed as being behind the muggle world socially/culturally/technologically.

The things like candles, robes, steam trains - they're purely cosmetic. Rowling used them to give the school a more magical feel.

Wizards are vastly more advanced technologically compared to muggles - they have spells that output energy indefinitely. This is something that's not there now, in 2019. They can teleport vast distances, they can make mountains of food out of a morsel, and they can heal and cure almost every single ailment.

James and Sirius used mirrors to talk to each other in the 70s - that's like video calling about 30 years before it became a thing.

There is literally no comparison in technology between the wiz world and the muggle one. They're miles ahead.
