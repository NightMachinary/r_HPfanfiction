In the US, age of majority at 21, but age of consent ranges from 16-18. In England, age of majority is 18, but age of consent is 16. In Europe, age of majority is generally 18, where as age of consent ranges from 14-16 (except for Cyprus (17), Ireland (17), Turkey (18) and Vatican City (18)).

In England historically, age of consent was 12 until 1875, 13 until 1885, and 16 since then, whereas the age of majority was 21 until it was reduced to 18 in 1969.

In the 1800s, the US's age of majority was 21, but age of consent ranged from 10-12 (except for Delaware which was 7 - yikes...)

So I would expect that the age of consent in the Wizarding world to most likely be a number of years before the age of majority. If we go by modern times, it would probably be 2-4 years. If we are going by the norm during 1800s, it would probably be more than that - probably 5-7 years, which would put age of consent at 10-12. Considering that Wizarding children are walking around with (potentially) lethal weapons at age 11, I wouldn't be surprised if the age of consent was the same.
