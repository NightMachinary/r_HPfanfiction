Until 1875, the age of consent in England was 12. Considering how the Wizarding World seems slower to change socially than Muggle society, at least partially due to the significantly longer lifespan of wizards and witches, one has to wonder what the legal age was when Harry Potter was at Hogwarts. It makes all the fanfic pairings in the first few years of Hogwarts even creepier if you think about it.
