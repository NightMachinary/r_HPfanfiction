If a young man is successful he can marry someone his own age or younger and have several children, meanwhile, a young man and an older woman can't. Therefore men marrying older women is generally seen as socially undesirable and is generally disapproved of.

Additionally, when Harry and Fleur meet Fleur is somewhere around 17 and Harry 14. 14 year olds are little kids, and Fleur expressed this view in GoF when she learned that Harry was in the tournament. A 14-year old has been a teenager for a year or two, while a 17 year old has been one for 4-5.

Similarly, if Remus and Tonks met at 35 and 22 respectively they had been adults, in the wizard sense, for 18 and 5 years respectively.

To answer the final question: because that's when they become adults. IRL it's a major social problem that education and the early stages of careers drag on for so long as they do these days.
