To tackle my issues with the Remus/Tonks pairing. Especially in the "The Potters lived, and Sirius is Lord Black, and the Potters and Blacks are tights-as-fuck with Ted Tonks as their lawyer" you get the idea. Hopefully. Why is it even in those fics somehow OK for Remus and Tonks to end up together? He's known her for her entire life. It's freaky. And doubly so when said fics try to make fun of it by throwing jokes about him changing her diapers.

The idea of him being a weird potentially auxiliary uncle figure for her already makes it weird. If he'd been an actual uncle figure it'd be extremely weird. Never take it further than that.
