I don't have an answer for the age difference issue, but for the getting married early one, Wizarding youth are functionally adults as soon as they graduate Hogwarts at 17 or 18. There is no higher education, so people are evidently expected to get jobs and start their lives right out of Hogwarts.

It's definitely evident in my grandparent's generation that the lack of higher education and a need to start building a life young leads to young marriages. I would expect that, with the exception of people taking on apprenticeships or doing jobs that require several years of training, like auroring or curse breaking, most Hogwarts students get married within three or four years of graduating.
