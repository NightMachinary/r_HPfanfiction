#+begin_quote
  A fateful encounter with Dr. Strange leaves the Winter Soldier transformed, and Bucky Barnes reunites with Steve Rogers in a most unexpected way. â€œSteve brings the puppy inside, into the apartment that doesn't quite feel like home no matter how much he's been trying. He isn't used to being alone. Before the war, he always had Bucky, and his mother until her death. During the war, Bucky was there, too---and the rest of the Howlers, of course---but Bucky always meant home. (And well, maybe Steve's already got a name for the puppy in mind)."
