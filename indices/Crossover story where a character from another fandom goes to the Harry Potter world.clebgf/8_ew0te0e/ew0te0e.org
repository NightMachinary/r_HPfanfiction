The Emerald Rose and Spots and Dots both have the main character (fem! Harry) first go to the One Piece world and then return to the Harry Potter world with an entourage. The Emerald Rose has left the Harry Potter world again while Spots and Dots is currently still there, though it seems that they'll return to One Piece as well.
