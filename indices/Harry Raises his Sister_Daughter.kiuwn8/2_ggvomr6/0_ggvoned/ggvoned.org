  What if a saner Voldemort, wary of a plot by Dumbledore, heard the prophecy and decided to assume a wait and see approach instead of leaping to action? Growing up as the son of two dedicated Order members who seem to care more about their war than their children, Harry becomes his sister's protector and nothing will ever stand between them. Not their parents' blind devotion to a vigilante with an overinflated sense of self importance and not a Dark Lord bent on slaughtering his way to complete dominance of Britain.  This is a Work In Progress. It is not finished. It may never be finished. Updates will be sporadic. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.
