Well there is a series I quite like which is the Darkness Within series. It is AU however, but I highly recommend it even though it is a long read. There are 3 main stories and one side story that is a must read if you enjoy the first 3. After you've read those there a plenty of one shots about the universe of this series written by the author (Kurinoone). I recommend reading the series in this order:
