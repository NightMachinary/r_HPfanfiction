If you'd be interested in a series set in the HP universe with a similar tone to the original books, but with all original characters and setting, I recommend you check out the Alexandra Quick series. The first is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]].

Some info about the kind of things you like to read would be helpful for giving better recommendations. What genres do you like? Is canon compliance important? Are there any characters you particularly like?
