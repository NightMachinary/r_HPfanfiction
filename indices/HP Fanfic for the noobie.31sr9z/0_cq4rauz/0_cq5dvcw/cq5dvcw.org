  I recommend you check out the Alexandra Quick series.

Thanks, I'll definitely do so!

  Some info about the kind of things you like to read would be helpful for giving better recommendations. What genres do you like?
#+end_quote

I've been reading scifi and fantasy more or less exclusively for about the past 30 years, so anything HP should fit OK. :-) I'm not a fan of Urban Fantasy, despite that you could argue there are some elements of that to HP...

  Is canon compliance important?
#+end_quote

I just figured it would be the easiest place to start. I don't think I'll turn my nose up at much in the way of deviation. Though if someone has written a story with some *major* change, such as Dumbledore is still alive after he should be, I'm hopeful that they'll explain it in a way that doesn't break the fact that it's pretty clear that we are supposed to believe he's dead.

#+begin_quote
  Are there any characters you particularly like?
#+end_quote

I pretty much like them all. *Edit: I fucking love Hagrid.* I'm a particular fan of Ron, and except for being sympathetic to Snape I really never found myself feeling much of a bond with the various Slytherin characters - but that wouldn't stop me from reading a book that centered on them. I really want to find good writing more than to dictate what it has to have. :-)

Thanks for the suggestion and help!
