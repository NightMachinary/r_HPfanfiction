Yeah, I guess so. For me, the joy of fanfiction is seeing the characters confronted with different, non-canon situations, and then responding to them in their own unique way, OR (in some cases) changing a character's personality (slightly or drastically) and seeing how the other characters react to that. An example of the first that I love a ton is "Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen" by The Mad Mad Reviewer, and a truly spectacular example of the second is "Time Heals All Wounds" and its sequels by brightsilverkitty.
