  Euphemia

Yeah, no. Like, a really big no in a shiny color with underlines and bells and a little bow. I refuse to believe anyone was named Euphemia or Fleamont. It sounds like a disease. Or someone trying to clear their throat of snot. Some people might dislike it, but I really like "Honour Thy Blood" and the backstory it gave to Harry's grandparents. Dorea and Charlus sound like badasses. Euphemia and Fleamont sounds just... blergh.
