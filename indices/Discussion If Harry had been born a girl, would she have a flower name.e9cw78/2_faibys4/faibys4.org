I think I've read a fic sort of about this, only with a still male Harry. Sirius was queuing up outside Hogwarts with him (while he was still unnamed by the Potters) in order to get him on the enrolment list and there was a whole conversation in there somewhere with other people in the queue about what they'd name the kid and if Sirius should just make it up for them instead. I remember a bit where they ask if the Potters are going to follow the 'Evans family tradition' of flower names and there's a little bit where they throw about boy flower names like Alder or Basil or Florian or something. It's been awhile since I read it, but I remember the flower conversation being interesting.

I mean, considering the fact that Rowling has a 'wolf-wolf' the werewolf in canon, terrible flower names wouldn't exactly be out of character for canon. If not flowery, then I expect semi-regular (for the time and culture) names would probably be picked - Jane or Amy or Emily or whatever and no 'Amarathea'-s or 'Violetta'-s or whatever.
