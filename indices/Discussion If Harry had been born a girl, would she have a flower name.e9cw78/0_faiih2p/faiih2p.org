If she did, I think it would be most likely to be the name Holly, to copy paste something I found:

“While it's mostly the leaves and the berries of the holly that gets people's attention, it's the flowers that mean protection and defense. Apart from being defense from thunder, witchcraft and things like that, it's also a symbol of a happy home life.” [[https://www.auntyflo.com/flower-dictionary/holly-flower]]

This works on multiple levels. The first is why James and Lily would choose that name. Because it's referring to the holly flower, the name represents what they want to protect in the fight against Voldemort. To protect a happy home life as a family against witchcraft or more specifically the dark arts.

Then we consider what happens to the Potters on Halloween 1981. Lily's love for Holly through her act of naming her so provides protection from the killing curse (witchcraft) leaving only a /lightning bolt/ scar.

Then we consider Holly herself. Her desire as shown through the Mirror of Erised, to see her parents and to have a /happy home life/ with them. She's exited to get away from the Dursley's to live with Sirius, The Burrow (a happy home) is one of her favourite places in the Wizarding World, and she is endlessly self-sacrificing, multiple times putting aside her safety and happiness for the sake of the one's she loves. Not to mention the many, /many/ times she saves someone else's life.

She goes to a school of /Witchcraft/ and Wizardry, and her best subject is /Defence against the Dark Arts./ (Dark Arts being referred to previously as witchcraft.) She's in the house of the Brave and Chivalrous, the knights defending others.

Then we have to consider the symbolism of lightning and thunder in the series. Lighting is mentioned very sparingly, but the moments I remember are her scar, the lightning when the Grim is at the Quidditch game and the chapter title Lightning Struck Tower where spoilers spoilers Snape kills Dumbledore. I'm not good at symbolism, so Super Carlin Brothers' video on why Harry/Holly has a lightning bolt scar would be a better explanation. [[https://youtu.be/VW2fe5YTWxU]]

And then at the end of it all, what does she end up with? A family and happy home life with three kids, and One Big Weasley Family in law. What she and her parents who named her always wanted.

In other words, this is why Harry's wand was made out of Holly.
