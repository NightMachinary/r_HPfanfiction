Yes, I think it would be a flower name, I like such family traditions and I would support it (I have Betelgeuse Black as a founder of the Black family in linkao3(11233098)).

Daughter of James & Lilly in [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister.html][my fanfiction]] (not a fem!Harry, but [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bevfuu/lf_harry_ginny_are_brother_and_sister/][Ginny who is not a Weasley girl]]) is Rose Potter. However when you look at this [[https://nameberry.com/list/97/Flower-Names-for-Girls][huge list of flower girl names]] you find plenty of names which are rather nice, not only the horrific ones. And yes, I liked Holly from [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]], or just remotely related [[https://www.wattpad.com/37216658-dursley%27s-daughter-a-harry-potter-next-generation/][Esther Dursley]] (alluding to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aster_(genus][Aster]])), there are useable names.
