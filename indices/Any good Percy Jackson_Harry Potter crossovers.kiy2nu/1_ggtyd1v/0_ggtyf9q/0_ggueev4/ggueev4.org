... Have you read "Shattered" by bobinthecomments? Or anything from them? I swear, till this day I haven't read anything greater that shattered... Like, the amount of world building is mind-blowing and the characters are so detailed... And the end! God, I cried so much during the final chapters I actually had to process for a few days. Also, the fanservice is... Well, you can mostly ignore it if you don't like the pairing? ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10793172/chapters/23940162]]) Summary: The world is hardly ever what it seems.

We have seen our heroes fight monsters, gods, titans, and even the very Earth itself. But, there were rules and procedures to be followed. A clear defined path to victory.

Now the enemy has no limits, no safeties, no restraints.

Or

Mortals aren't as blind and powerless as the gods seem to think..

It's not a crossover but a fantastic fic nonetheless.
