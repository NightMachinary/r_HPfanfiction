In my experience, there aren't many good Percy Jackson fics to begin with (unless you really like soul mates or high school AUs), so finding good crossovers is extra difficult.

linkffn(Harry Potter, Squatter by Enterprise1701-d) is the most popular one, so you've probably already seen it. If not, then there aren't many better options, so you might as well give it a shot. But it's over 300k words (and updating decently regularly), but it only has maybe 20k words of actual story. The rest is pure fluff and Harry getting new toys. It's at least an easy and not unenjoyable read. At least until you realize that nothing is likely to ever happen and that Harry is probably the biggest Mary Sue you've ever seen. It's basically fanfiction junk food.

linkffn(Dies Irae by MufuMufuSan) is probably my favorite Percy Jackson fic, though it is still just getting started. What really sold me on it was Persephone being a main character and the actions she's getting up to.
