I'm on mobile so I'm sorry if this messes up, but linkffn(The Professor by lildrummerboi) is one I've been enjoying for a bit now. It started pretty recently and the author likes to post story arcs in spurts. I especially like the dynamic between Percy and Harry, and the author has made it clear it's very much Harry's story, with Percy in a supportive role.
