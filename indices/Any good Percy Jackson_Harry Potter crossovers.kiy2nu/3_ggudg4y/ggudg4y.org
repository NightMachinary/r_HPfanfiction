Obviously I have to recommend the Harry Potter and Some Other Nerds Series, first book (Oi, Death wants to protect you cuz some other loser has got to die) is complete and suuuuper awesome! We're following the OC's for a good time and Percy doesn't figure much, but ughhhh the writing is great. ([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/898773]])

And also the crack/one shot How to interrupt a monologue: Nico di Angelo's Style. ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13948497]])

There's some more on AO3 but not complete or the ones that are... Well, they aren't my cup of tea. :/
