Absolutely not. It's a clear case of fanon displacing canon.

Here are two sources: [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Draco_Malfoy][HP Wiki]] and [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/draco.html][HP Lexicon]]. The wiki states:

#+begin_quote
  Draco was quite intelligent and quick-witted, capable of deducing things and coming up with clever plans based on a small amount of information; his father had expected him to obtain top marks in school after his first year, and showed disappointment that Hermione beat him.
#+end_quote

This is /purely/ conjecture (and terribly phrased). The Lexicon makes no reference to any supposed intelligence. Scan through their article and you'll find no mention of any cleverness or distinguished academic achievement. It's no wonder the Lexicon is considered to be a far more reliable source of information regarding canon.

Now what purpose does the CoS scene in Borgin & Burkes serve? It introduces us to Lucius in an unguarded moment. The quip about Hermione's academic prowess is /not/ made to give us insight into Draco's intellect, but to showcase Lucius' bigotry towards witches of 'no proper family.' That hasn't stopped Draco fans from treating this scene as a ringing endorsement of the clever!Draco trope.

Draco's use of the Protean Charm is also often used to justify his ranks within the intellectual elite at Hogwarts. This is supposed to be an extremely difficult piece of magic to get down properly, as we learned from Hermione's use of it in OotP (it's N.E.W.T. level magic and by then they hadn't taken their O.W.L.s). So far as we know, Draco was only able to reproduce her work after consulting an original DA galleon. [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/magic/spells/spells_p.html#protean_charm][The Lexicon]] states that his copying of her work is intentional. So that tells us that he wasn't clever enough to figure it out on his own. Also, +Gregory Goyle+ Vincent Crabbe - who is widely considered to be quite [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/goyle.html][stupid]] was able to master the incantation and wand movements for Fiendfyre even though he proved unable to control it properly. Having a character cast one difficult spell one time does not instantly make them a genius. It's also entirely possible that his Aunt Bellatrix, mother, father, or any other qualified post-N.E.W.T. Death Eater performed the spell for him.

TL;DR: Draco's fans have made him smart in fanon to better pair him with Hermione.
