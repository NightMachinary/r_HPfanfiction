I think that the scene in Chamber of Secrets in which Lucius berates Draco for being beaten on every exam by Hermione is sometimes taken to mean that Draco was /only/ beaten by Hermione, and is thus the second strongest student in the class.

Of course, Lucius also complains that Draco needs to get his grades up, so perhaps he is not doing outstandingly at all, but Lucius knows he can shame his son more by talking about how Hermione beat him.

I don't remember what info there was about Draco's studies later on. He did show a high level of intelligence and skill when he broke the Death Eaters into Hogwarts in HBP.
