The only thing we can infer from the scene about Draco and Hermione's grades is that /at least/ Hermione beat him. Any number of others could as well. They only mention Hermione.

There isn't enough evidence to conclude that he's #2 in Hogwarts in his year. That same excerpt (below) also doesn't state that Hermione is #1. It just says that Hermione did better on her exams than Draco.
