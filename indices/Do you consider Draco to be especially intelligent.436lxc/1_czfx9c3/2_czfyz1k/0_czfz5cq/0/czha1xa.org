If the Vanishing Cabinet is anything like a wand or the portraits, it probably can't be fixed properly by magical means since IIRC, Flich would be responsible for fixing that stuff via non-magical means, and a broken wand is worthless without having the Elder Wand to fix it. I don't think any magical item (e.g. wand, portrait, etc) could be fixed that easily and even if it was, it wouldn't be guaranteed to work properly. I think someone with specialist knowledge in magical objects like Mr Borgin would have fixed it way faster than Draco did.

So I agree with you. I don't think fixing a vanishing cabinet is a matter of intelligence but more a matter of experience. I think fixing one is really easy if the person knows what they are doing (e.g. Mr Borgin) and would take a few weeks/hours/days, but the vast majority of wizards (even the smart ones) wouldn't have any experience trying to fix a vanishing cabinet and either will give up or take months to fix it. In that sense, it would be like Harry's Patronus since a patronus is about strong emotions rather than actual power/intelligence of a wizard.
