And Crabbe summoned fiendfyre and Pettigrew was an animagus, both of which are also extremely hard... Yet I wouldn't call either of them smart.

Being good at one or two things "above your grade" (if Hogwarts has any standardized curriculum at all that is) doesn't make you a genius. Here's the facts:

- Snape was clearly in on it. He even flat-out reminded him to use it in Harry's duel, which he also set up.
- Draco never used another fancy spell since then. He never showed to be capable of dueling magic or knowing how to defend himself.
- There are several moments where he or his parents are complaining that his grades are low (of course he blames it on the teachers rather than take responsibility for his failings).

From this I conclude that him knowing Serpensortia was a one time deal. Snape was the one who taught him that spell for the sole purpose of humiliating Harry (and we don't know how long it took him, it could very well have been a months work or more for that one spell). Draco has never showed any real talent for dueling or high level spells since then, which we would have expected had he truly been this prodigious by himself.
