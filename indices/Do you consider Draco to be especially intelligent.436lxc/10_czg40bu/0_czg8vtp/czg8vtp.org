You can certainly be clever but not intelligent (book smart), or clever and not wise (more assimilated experience), or clever and ignorant (not informed), or even clever and not perceptive. Clever implies a quickness of thought, and sometimes a cunningness (or sneakiness) of ideas. All of those can be measures of how smart you are.
