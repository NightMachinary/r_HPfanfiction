This was my point exactly. I also think that even if Lucius would normally by happy with an A-, the fact that it's a Muggleborn who got the A+ makes it unacceptable to him.

There's also the fact that Hermione scored 112% on her Charms exam that first year. If she was that good in all her classes (and it's heavily implied she is) then even people getting 95% are going to look bad in comparison.
