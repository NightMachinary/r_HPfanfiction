Lucius actually doesn't even mention Hermione, Draco does. And then Lucius needles him about it because /even a muggleborn/ is doing better than him.

  "Though if his school marks don't pick up," said Mr Malfoy, more coldly still, "that may indeed be all he is fit for."

  "It's not my fault," retorted Draco. "The teachers all have favourites, that Hermione Granger---"

  "And what's to stop you from ingratiating yourself to the teachers as well then?" snapped Mr Malfoy.

Obviously pure conjecture, but that's how I'd imagine the exchange.
