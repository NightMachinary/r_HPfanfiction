I guess it depends on whether you think Lucius is the kind of father who would consider a A- to be a low mark that needs to go up. There are parents who think that a C is perfectly acceptable, and there are parents who would be ashamed if their kid brought home anything less than a right out A.

ETA: And Lucius only mentions ONE muggleborn who beat Draco (Hermione). If multiple muggleborns had better grades, wouldn't that bear mentioning?
