I get the impression that Draco is meant to be as intelligent as Harry so there's nothing to compare him to Hermione's logical or book-smart mind. Since he's a foil to Harry throughout the books, it would make sense to be if they're about the same when it comes to intelligence. They just have different skill sets. Draco is excellent at occulumeny while Harry struggles in it, but can cast the patronus from a young age. They're both seekers. We can assume Draco had an O in Potions since he was already in the class. Harry had an O in DADA.

He's quick-witted, although he usually uses this to be rude to Harry and friends. Harry is equally snarky. He's good at deducing things (he noticed Harry was invisible in the train compartment, realized the connection between the vanishing cabinets) and Harry's ability to deduce things is usually what gets him into all sorts of trouble.
