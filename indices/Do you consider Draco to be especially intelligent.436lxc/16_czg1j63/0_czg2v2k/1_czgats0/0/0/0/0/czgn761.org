You can disagree if you'd like. I based my comments on the dictionary definition of clever, which is overwhelmingly composed of words that indicate above average intelligence.

All the synonyms for clever are also words that are associated with above average intelligence (canny, cunning, skillful, adroit, smart, bright, quick-witted, sharp, and so forth).
