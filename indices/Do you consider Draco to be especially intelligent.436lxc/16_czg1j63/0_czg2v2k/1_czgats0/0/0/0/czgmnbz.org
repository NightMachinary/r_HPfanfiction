I disagree. I'd say that you need some level of intelligence, but above average? I just don't see any basis for that assertion, given how subjective defining and measuring intelligence can be. How do we actually know that you have to have above average intelligence to be clever, as opposed to somewhat intelligent? Hell, what are we even defining intelligence as? How well you do in school? Emotional intelligence? Gut instinct? To me, it's one thing to suggest that one requires the presence of the other, but to say that you have to have one and be at an above average level seems to be unfounded.
