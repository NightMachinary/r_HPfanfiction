You might find it interesting to read about Samuel Johnson, who wrote one of the most influential early English dictionaries. He saw the process of writing a definition as similar to establishing precedent in law:

#+begin_quote
  I shall therefore, since the rules of stile, like those of law, arise from precedents often repeated, collect the testimonies of both sides, and endeavour to discover and promulgate the decrees of custom, who has so long possessed whether by right or by usurpation, the sovereignty of words.
#+end_quote

IE, he researched the many ways words were used already in language. He also made the innovation of supporting his definition by illustrating the words' uses in literary quotation.
