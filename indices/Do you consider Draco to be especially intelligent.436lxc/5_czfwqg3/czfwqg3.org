There was an excerpt on jkr 's site about how she originally had Draco walking around with Theo nott at his Manor, and how Draco considered him to be clever and they basically didn't bullshit each other. Notes on theo I read somewhere that I think were official was that theo was a loner but he was clever. I couldn't imagine that he would keep Draco as a friend if he wasn't intelligent and useful.

Edit: and then there are the arguments that Draco was a prefect and that wasnt just because, it was because of grades and leadership abilities (not that I'm saying he's a good leader in fifth year lol). But also the upper level classes he was in for some of Harrys classes, like in HBP
