I've never said Ron is a dumb, you said that. I don't think Ron fits, because he's lazy as hell. He never cares about homework or school rules (he even broke sooo many with Harry). So no, I don't think he fits as a prefect... Because yes, he is a hero, but as a student... no, he never should be a prefect. You should understand the harry potter plot, is different than the school life... and about that, Draco cares more about the studies than Ron does. [[/u/zojgruhl]]
