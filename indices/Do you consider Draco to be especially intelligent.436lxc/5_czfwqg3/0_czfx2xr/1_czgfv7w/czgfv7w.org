  I don't think there was an explanation as to how Draco became a prefect, actually.

Actually we do know. At the end of book 5 Dumbledore explains to Harry why he wasn't chosen, from this we know the process in which prefects are selected.

It goes like this:

- The heads of each house pick one boy and one girl they like best.
- Dumbledore can veto if he wants for whatever reason he wants (even non-school related reasons like why he vetoed Harry)

And that's seriously it... Malfoy was picked because Snape picked him. There are no other requirements (like grades) or leadership abilities. It was all pure nepotism.
