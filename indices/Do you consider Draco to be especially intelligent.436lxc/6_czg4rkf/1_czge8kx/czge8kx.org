  Harry does, too, and he's no mental giant. I believe Ron takes all those NEWT classes as well.

All that says is that Draco, Harry and Ron are of similar intelligence.

Harry might be no mental giant, but he is not stupid either. He is the type of student that is known as "straight B student" - getting good grades on talent combined with a reasonable amount of effort.

He can easily keep up with Hermione, who we know for sure is above average intelligence (canon says so). She has a lots of booksmarts and a strong work ethic, which gets her top grades when it comes to written essays; in contrast Harry seems to have a more practical intelligence. Hand Hermione a hammer and she will hit her own hand, hand Harry a hammer and he will nail it.

Ron only gets mediocre grades because he has a tendency to procrastinate. He is not stupid, just lazy with a laid back attitude towards studying. (Take a look at Fred and George and their grades compared with their obvious talent.) Having Hermione nag at Ron and sitting down with Harry and Hermione to study pulls Ron' grades up sufficiently so that he easily gets into the same classes as them and mostly getting similar grades as Harry. If he put in the same work as Hermione I can really see him getting Outstanding in many classes.

Draco seems to fall into the same category as the Trio - above average intelligence with genuine talent but no genius/child prodigy.
