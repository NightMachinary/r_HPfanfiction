  All that says is that Draco, Harry and Ron are of similar intelligence.

That's kinda my point. I don't consider Harry and Ron to be especially smart. I see them as average-ish. Harry is the Defense star with middling grades in everything else. Hermione is above-average across the board. I see Hermione as fulfilling the "jack of all trades, master of none" adage. Ron is lazy but does well enough, maybe due to Hermione's assistance. Neville is average-ish, but amazing in Herbology and terrible at +potions+ Snape.

My main primary point was that we frankly don't know much about Draco in any sense (or really any students other than Harry, Ron, and Hermione). Draco gets more time than most of the other students, but all it really tells us is that he's a jerk. He could be smart, he could be not. He could be a deeply convicted young man who is struggling with separating his beliefs from the ones his father instilled in him, or he could just be a coward too afraid to follow through on his beliefs.

We all have our interpretations from the books, but there's just not enough information out there.
