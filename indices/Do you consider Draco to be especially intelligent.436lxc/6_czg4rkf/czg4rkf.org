I never really saw anything saying he was especially smart (or stupid).

He conjures the snake at 12, but the lack of reaction from any students or staff kinda takes the wind out of that argument. In contrast, when Harry casts a corporeal patronus at 13 it's big news and repeated frequently.

He's made a prefect, which could be indicative of intelligence. It could be just as easily be Lucius bribing Snape with gold or favors (again). Snape ostensibly has the final say in the Quidditch roster, and he gave Draco a spot because Lucius bought the team brooms. Is Draco a decent seeker? It doesn't seem like it to me.

Draco takes NEWT Potions, Defense, and Transfiguration among others. Harry does, too, and he's no mental giant. I believe Ron takes all those NEWT classes as well.

I consider him average at best.
