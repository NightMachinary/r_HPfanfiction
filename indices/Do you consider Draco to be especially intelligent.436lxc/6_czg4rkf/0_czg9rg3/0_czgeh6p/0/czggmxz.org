Did Lucius bribe Draco onto the team, or did Draco make the team AND Lucius gifted them the brooms? Either could be the case, and Draco doesn't seem to have been a mediocre seeker, at least not compared to those he goes up against.

Certainly if Draco made it onto the team on his own skill, his father did him no good by gifting them the brooms. But I don't suppose either would necessarily question how it would look to outsiders until after the fact. They are used to having the advantage of the best goods and materials, and to a person as wealthy as Lucius it might seem a small gift.
