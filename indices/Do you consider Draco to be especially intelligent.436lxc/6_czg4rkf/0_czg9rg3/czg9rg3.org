  Draco takes NEWT Potions, Defense, and Transfiguration among others. Harry does, too, and he's no mental giant. I believe Ron takes all those NEWT classes as well.

I don't think that speaks bad about Draco.

- Potions was supposed to be only for Outstanding marks. Harry and Ron are the only ones who need the books and materials, so we can safely assume that all the rest got an O in the Potions OWL.

- Ron somehow didn't get an O in Defense even with the help of the DA, while Malfoy got in the NEWT class of DADA without going to the DA. Then Draco proceeds to do much better than Ron at non-verbal spells.

- Transfiguration only requires an A. We have no idea about Draco's mark in his OWL.

And about the snake conjuring, people were afraid of the snake, and after that he kinda got outshone by Harry speaking Parseltongue.

  Is Draco a decent seeker? It doesn't seem like it to me.

And yet, he manages to outfly Cho and Cedric, two very good Quidditch players (not only beat, Slytherin completely demolish Hufflpuff by probably 250+ points), and almost beats Harry in the 3^{rd} year final match even though Harry had a superior broom. Keep in mind that most of the time we see Draco fly we can only compare him to Harry, who is a flying prodigy.
