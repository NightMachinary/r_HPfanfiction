As far as I can tell, Draco is fairly intelligent. He could be a very important and intelligent person someday, provided he gets his head out of his ass regarding learning how to keep his opinions to himself, gets some humility beat into him, and learns how to see the value in other people (and not even personal value, just positional would get him somewhere).
