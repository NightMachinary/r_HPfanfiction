Firstly, clever and sneaky, while often used interchangeably, are /not/ the same thing. However, sneaky and cunning can (mostly) be used interchangeably.

'Sneaky' implies against, or at least not within, established rules, and can also mean done without another's knowledge. Likewise, 'cunning' is subtlety with elements of deceptiveness but also some level of skill beyond what 'sneaky'.

'Clever' is quick thinking or sometimes /dexterous/ thinking (which is why there is sometimes an overlap with sneakiness, as this is often seen as 'outside the box' thinking), but it is not deceptive or subtle.

So what evidence to you have that Hermione is either cunning or sneaky? Draco shows /both/ quick thinking and a level of deception/subtlety when he tricks Harry and Ron to attend the duel. In other words, he is both clever and cunning/sneaky.

As a 1st year or second year, and even into third Hermione is portrayed as know-it-all, bossy, book smart, loyal (sort of), and rule abiding. She argues /against/ sneakiness, she obeys the rules. I can't think of any action of hers in those early years which is particularly sneaky. She is more seen as classically intelligent (she knows facts, is logical, and can plan and problem solve) but she doesn't do so necessarily quickly, nor dexterously.
