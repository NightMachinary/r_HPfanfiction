In second year Hermione organized a group of her and two other twelve year olds to steal from a teacher, drug two students and infiltrate a password protected private area in disguise. That would pretty fucking impressive for an adult, nowhere in the books does Draco show anything near that level of sneakiness. The thing with the duel is a case of Harry being a retard and has nothing to do with Draco being smart.
