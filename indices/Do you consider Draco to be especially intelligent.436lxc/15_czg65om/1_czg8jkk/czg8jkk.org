Actually Draco wasn't provoking Buckbeak. He bowed and everything. He just casually insulted the animal, as he is wont. And if you think surviving due to plot armor is a point against a character, Hello golden trio. Subtlety I agree with, but he is cunning. He brought death eaters to Hogwarts, which even Dumbledore thought was impossible. He also created those badges - Harry stinks - which any student in Gryffindor including Granger - could reverse. In fact any attempts resulted in worst insults.
