No. People here seem to give examples of feats he achieved (plot devices, which really aren't that impressive), and completely ignore his exceedingly moronic behaviour. Draco is an idiot. Through his thuggish and disrespectful behaviour he has made everyone hate him (I imagine that his housemates hated him more than anyone else), the professors despise him, Snape probably wants to murder him for having to deal with his shit, and his mother is likely extremely ashamed after having to drag his leper-like body out of the Hogwarts Express two years in a row.

He has no sense of diplomacy or tact, which alienates every ally he might hope to make (not just Harry, but I imagine Viktor didn't like him much after talking to him for a minute), and continuously literally screams opinions that a clever kid would know keep to himself (/"youre next, mudbloods!"/). He is a complete loser who would have been nowhere without his daddy's influence. His HBP plot only worked because Dumbledore allowed it to, and told Harry to ignore it.

Animal conjuration? Ron does it in the same book. Fixing a Vanishing Cabinet? after an year of getting instructions from Borgin, who probably has a lot of experience with that. Occlumency? I don't think Harry's half-hearted attempts give us a clear picture of how hard it is to learn. Prefectship? seeing how unexamplary he acted when given the power, we can assume that he wasn't given the position for his responsibility and maturity (and those who say Ron is stupid, well, he was given the same position). Slytherin Prince? Slytherin Sex God? his only friends were two dumb sycophants that betrayed him when they had the opportunity, and the only girl he dated at Hogwarts was frequently described as "pug-faced".

Draco's only saving grace is that he is too cowardly, incompetent and spineless to do something truly horrible.
