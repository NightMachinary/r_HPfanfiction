They aren't written as evil assholes. Just because /we/ live in a society where teenagers run and cry to a teacher every time some kid /teases/ them, doesn't mean everyone does. Children in the wizarding world are often depicted as being more self-reliant.

They don't /tattle/, and when they /do/, nearly all of the adults expect them to work it out. Even nurturers like the Weasleys.

Consider all the /crap/ and torment Fred and George put a young Ron through. And the few times when they intervene beyond a "stop dat" is when it's a matter of life and death. Like when they were going to have him make the unbreakable vow.

Even when it progresses into the realm of "bullying", well that wasn't really a big deal in the early 90s (when Potter started at Hogwarts) anyway. People weren't as /sensitive/ then.

And even less so in the wizarding world. The things you named aren't "attacks", they're /childish teasing/ and considered quite normal.

If you have even an inkling of "suspension of disbelief", and you can accept that Hogwarts exists, then you're fully capable of accepting that the wizard children are a bit more resilient.

Once you've accepted that "well don't tattle, pull up your big boy pants and deal with it" is normal, then you can accept that "Potter stinks" badges and lying for sympathy and the problems these things cause for one kid don't really register high on any adult's radar. Sorry you're having a tough year, kid, but man up.

They weren't being evil, or assholes, they were being what passes for normal. Keep in mind too, this is a society where at some point since Argus Filch was old enough to remember (50s? 60s?) it was acceptable to punish children with manacles and whips.

They are actually /unbelievably/ nuturing, given the society which produced them.

Now that we understand the /ways/ in which the society works, we can look at Draco's actions within it.

Yes, knowing that people either won't believe, or won't dare contradict you, at 12-13 years old when you claim an injury, is a /little/ clever. Not the cleverest, but by no means stupid, either.

His "Potter stinks" plan was ingenuous. He wasn't only teasing the boy, he was doing so in a way that would not violate a single rule - he /could not/ be punished for it. And it was done in such a way that Harry would feel entirely isolated - the whole school /had/ to support Cedric, so even many who weren't against Harry would wear the badges simply to support /Hogwarts/.

He came up with the "Weasley is our King" song (which is rather clever, as far as wording) and used it in a highly effective manner to throw off not just Ron, but the entire Gryffindor team for /ages/.

Even at 11, just starting, most children who have influential parents know barely enough to say "Oh, well I will tell my Dad!" whereas Draco knew how to /wield/ his family's influence, effectively.

As far as education - Potions, under Snape, required an "O" on the O.W.L.S. - Snape himself admitted this was an extremely high standard. The O.W.L.S. aren't administered by the professors, but by a team of (old as hell) wizards from various places, and you've no way of knowing who will test you. Draco made mistakes, and he could not use his family name to cheat - the administers did not /care/. Still, he managed an "O" in Potions - which even Harry could not do. In fact there were very few who did make it.

  When they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to N.E.W.T. level. Crabbe and Goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required O.W.L. grade, but four Slytherins had made it through, including Malfoy. Four Ravenclaws were there, and one Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan
#+end_quote

Ravenclaws are typically the clever ones. Only 4 made it. The only Gryffindor, then who got an "O" was Hermione. (Harry and Ron got lucky with an "E" because the professor changed.)

I'd say that speaks more to his intelligence than anything, but lets carry on.

Speaking of O.W.L.S, Hermione got an "E" in Defense Against the Dark Arts, and Malfoy got an "O". He's more clever than her at /something/ even though he's shown goofing off while she grinds her nose to the books. He slips through the classes on his name, but he /aces/ the tests. Harry and Ron rely on their experience (often gained from luck). Draco doesn't have this. Hermione relies on constant study, and an insanely good memory. Draco doesn't study often (that we can tell). Yet he still manages to ace the O.W.L.S. presumably with some combination of knowledge and logic, which is actually quite clever.

Finally, no, not all students take N.E.W.T.S. Fred and George, for example, never intended to. They didn't have the O.W.L.S for them. There are many fifth years who aren't mentioned again in Book 6. And there are a /multitude/ of wizards mentioned who only got an O.W.L. or two in their time. N.E.W.T.S. require at least /passing/ grades. Neville got, I believe, 4. Charms, herbology, DADA, and Transfiguration. But his Transfiguration was only an A, and that does /not/ qualify you for N.E.W.T.S.

He got DADA only because of Dumbledore's Army lessons, and Charms and Herbology are considered "Pass" classes. Only complete morons miss those.

I think the misunderstanding here is when people don't realize how O.W.L.S work.

You "Get an O.W.L." by scraping by. Barely passing. Acceptable. (What would be a "D" in an American school, for example).

You get into a N.E.W.T. class with /good/ grades. Some require an "E" (exceeds expectations, loosely resembling a "B" in the USA) or an "O" (Outstanding - these are your Honor students)

Most people - wizards or otherwise - are average. "A"ccpetable. Not N.E.W.T. material. Your A and B students are N.E.W.T. worthy.

Draco /took/ 4. Even though he had tons of other stuff going on, he took 4. He could very well be eligible for more. After all, Hermione got 10 O and E O.W.L.S. and only took 7 N.E.W.T. classes. And she's an overachiever. Most of the wizard students whose classes/OWL levels are revealed /don't/ take all the N.E.W.T.S they can.

Harry and Ron each only got 7 O.W.L.S., (/failing/ 2 classes each) even with Hermione's help, and had enough for 4 N.E.W.T. classes (5 including the changed Potions requirement) Huh. With experience /and/ Hermione's help, they got about what Draco did - and his "help" was Crabbe and Goyle - two morons. And way less experience.

I'm not sure how anyone gets the idea that no students are struggling (unless people who have only seen the movies) because it's /specifically/ mentioned that even during /study/ for the exams, people regularly break down from the stress, and end up either in the infirmary, or sent home. When Harry is seeing Voldemort, they actually chalk it up to O.W.L.S, because it /is/ so common for wizarding students to struggle.

We don't usually see them struggling, because those students are rather irrelevant to the plot. But they do.

Finally, Draco got the drop on Harry, numerous times. He got /poison/ into Hogwarts, a feat which astounded everyone because it had never happened, /and/ they had more stringent security.

The necklace would have worked as well, since, if you recall, from the books, Filch was not at the entrance scanning for cursed items when Katie Bell was cursed, and it was only Luck that saved Dumbledore. If a friend hadn't grabbed for the package, Katie /could/ have walked it inside, handed it to Dumbledore (who, by the way, /does/ make mistakes) and said "Professor, do you know what this is?" to which his in-character reaction would have been to hold out his hands for the object, and immediately be cursed.

And no, Dumbledore had no way to tell Katie was under the Imperious curse. He did not recognize it in Rosemerta, and therefore would not have in Katie. It /was/ a good plan, and only luck kept the Headmaster alive.

Well, luck and Slughorn's love of booze.

I'd say coming closer than anyone ever to killing the most powerful wizard alive, while attending school, repairing a vanishing cabinet, fielding death threats from death eaters, and keeping up with classes, not to mention avoiding detection by the "chosen one" and not being caught until everything fell together at the end - well, I think that's pretty clever.
