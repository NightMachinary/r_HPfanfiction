Katie almost died, Ron and Slughorn almost died. Slim chance? I think not. Also, he knew Draco was out to get him, even a flobberworm would be smart enough check with the first subject after the first attack. Either Dumbledore protected Draco - or Dumbledore was an utter idiot with less brains than a flobberworm. "Oh... I know Draco wants to kill me... and there was this incident, hm.... could they be related? maybe I should have my elves and portraits and other spies keep an eye on Draco? Maybe inform Harry about it? Naw.... it'll all work out!"

I think it is good to kill Draco, instead of risking the lives of innocents.
