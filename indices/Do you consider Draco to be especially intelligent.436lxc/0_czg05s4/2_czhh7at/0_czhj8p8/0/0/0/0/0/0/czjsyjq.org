Dumbledore knew that Draco was going to try to kill him. That is all. He also knew that Snape was going to kill him. And that Snape was under the Unbreakable Vow to kill him (Dumbledore) if Draco failed. Again, it's explained /very specifically/ in the /books/. (which are not /entirely/ written from HP's POV)

There was nothing linking a cursed necklace which a /random kid/ brought back from /Hogsmead/ to Dumbledore or Draco. There was nothing linking a poisoned wine bottle in a teacher's office to Dumbledore or Draco.

(And in fact, the book /specifically/ shows Dumbledore realizing that Rosmerta poisoned the bottle under the Imperius curse /as Draco is about to not-kill him/ - when he finds out that she has, in fact, been cursed.)

And again, book six shows the /most/ of Malfoy, but it is not the only book that specifies.

Snape /could not/ tell Dumbledore /anything/ regarding Draco because he was under the Unbreakable Vow. Not inept, not a traitor, just he would *literally die the second he said a word against Draco*.

And no, "saving the Malfoys" was never a priority over "saving the students" but yes, a /good/ man would have wanted it over without any of them dying. Chances of a murder in Hogwarts? Slim. Chances of Draco (A CHILD) and his entire family being murdered if Dumbledore accosted him? 100%.

He can't hold Draco at school if Draco's mother calls him home. There, Voldemort kills them. Including the kid.

If you think it's okay to send a kid to their /guaranteed immediate/ death, that in fact you /must do so/ to be a "good" person, then, well, I don't really care about your opinion on what makes anyone an "evil man".

And again, everything you've said is hypothetical and unsupported opinion. Downvote if you want, the proof is in the books, and I'm done arguing with "because I think it's wrong".
