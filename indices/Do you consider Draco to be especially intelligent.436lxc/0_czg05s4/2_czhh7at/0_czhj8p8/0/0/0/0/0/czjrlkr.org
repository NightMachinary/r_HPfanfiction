If Dumbledore didn't know it was Draco, then Snape, who knew about it, was inept, or a traitor, and Dumbledore would have been an idiot for trusting Snape either way. And even if Snape was unable to tell Dumbledore, Dumbledore could have found out who was the culprit simply by having Snape read the minds of the usual suspects - a short list which Draco would lead, and then conclude that it has to be him when Snape can't tell him anything about him.

And yes, he could and should have shut down Draco - the Malfoys were Death Eaters working for Voldemort. I know people like to white-wash Death Eaters, but to demand that the Malfoys are saved at the cost of innocents goes a bit too far. Sacrificing them to prevent Katie from getting cursed, or Ron and Slughorn from getting poisened would have been the right choice to take. Protecting Draco made Dumbledore an evil man.

And once again: We don't see what Draco is up to - we only see him when he's antagonizing Harry. Book 6 doesn't really count since he was working to save his family and kill Dumbledore, and focused on that instead of on school work.
