In a society where every child carries a lethal weapon and there's a thing like accidental magic, the only teachers that don't care about incidents that might escalate into lethal confrontations are utter idiots or evil assholes.

One again, you assume Draco got no help in school just because we didn't see it in the books - which were told from Harry's point of view.

Draco only ever got close with his assassination attempts because the victim himself was covering for him, and had Snape help him out. (Not to mention that the whole plot made Dumbledore evil and/or stupid again, since no competent good man would let a killer endanger students in his care - especially after the first time bystanders were almost killed. Draco should have been shut down, hard right then and there, if JKR hadn't wanted to ruin her characters.)
