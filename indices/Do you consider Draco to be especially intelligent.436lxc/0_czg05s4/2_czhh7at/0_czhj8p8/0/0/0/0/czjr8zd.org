  In a society where every child carries a lethal weapon and there's a thing like accidental magic, the only teachers that don't care about incidents that might escalate into lethal confrontations are utter idiots or evil assholes

Except they don't. In the books - not the wiki, or the lexicon, or the movie, or the fanfics - but the actual books, the adults - teachers and parents alike, leave children to their own devices until it /is/ physically dangerous. All of them.

And actually, from a sociological standpoint, it makes sense as well. You see it with most societies where children need to learn /survival/ versus sitting in an office staring at a computer. Tribal societies, for example, as well as medieval ones. Hell, even in early American history.

"Sheltering" children and breaking up petty disputes is practically brand new. "Go work it out" is a model, that, whether or not it offends our modern sensibilities, has worked for years.

I "assume" Draco got no help in school because he is described in the books (especially 6th year) skulking the corridors - while everyone else is studying. Formulating pranks and plans - while everyone else is studying. Showing off - while everyone else is studying. In the room of requirement - while everyone else is studying.

He blatantly states that he doesn't bother with his homework, in no less than 3 of the books, and he spends his "down time" with Crabbe (moron) and Goyle (moron), oh and Pansy Parkinson (moron). He /has/ no one intelligent to help him.

Dumbledore /did not/ "cover for him", in the books. He was never /certain/ of anything. Unlike in the movies, It isn't until Harry brings him the final piece of the puzzle that everything starts clicking into place, and he knows it was Draco.

Dumbledore is far less "all knowing" in the books, but he isn't an idiot either. He doesn't know Rosemerta is under the imperious curse until Draco says it was her. He doesn't /know/ which student it was, and all he has to go on is the unsupported suspicions of another /child/ who hates Draco. And meanwhile there are several other possibilities - Crabbe and Goyle, for two, who are specifically listed as Death Eaters in books 5 through 7, and who have no alibis for the time when Katie Bell was attacked - while on the other hand, Draco does - he was not only in the school, he was with the Deputy Headmistress, Professor McGonagall at the time.

Snape did not know of any of the assassination attempts until after they failed (or succeeded) in the books. He /was/ aware of them after the fact, but then, if he so much as /told/ Dumbledore what he knew, he would drop dead. And Draco would be dead. And Dumbledore would die.

And yes, even with a single murderer loose in Hogwarts, (where no one died) it was safer than out in the wizarding world where multiple people were dying every single day. There were Death Eaters, Inferi, Dementors, and a raging lunatic of a werewolf out there. Hogwarts is safer.

In the /books/ (do people here actually read those?) Dumbledore couldn't have shut Draco down - /even if he could prove it was Draco/ - without Draco and his entire family being murdered.

And whether that makes Dumbledore (who was, /in any case/, a better man than most in the wizarding world) was a "good man" or not highly depends. Are you judging him by the society they live in? Or through your own world?

People "almost died" all the time in the wizarding world. Accidental spells, blown-up cauldrons. Quidditch. Ferocious animals. Each other. If you use today's standards, then yes, Draco should have been shut down the first time. And Quidditch banned. And Hagrid fired, and the forest sealed off, and Potions and DADA cancelled and Umbridge made Headmistress, so we can wrap the little darlings up in Contemporary layers of Safety, and leave them utterly helpless.

JKR didn't ruin her characters. Hollywood and "fans" may have, but in the context of /just the books/ it's all tied up rather nicely.

(Keep downvoting if you want, it doesn't make you correct. I'm sitting here /with/ the books, making well-reasoned, supported statements, and you're throwing out a paragraph of broad sweeping statements about the "series" supported only by opinion. Your votes don't affect me. Want to make an impression? Let's see evidence. :))
