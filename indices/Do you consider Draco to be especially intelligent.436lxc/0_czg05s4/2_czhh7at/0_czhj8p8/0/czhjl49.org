I don't see this "great cunning" anywhere. He appears as a typical spoiled brat using his father's name and influence to get by. His ploys are so utterly stupid, they only work because everyone else seems to be rendered stupid for plot reasons - like his oh so cunning "I'm hurt terribly by this beast, I cannot play Quidditch right now" plan. And his "Potter stinks" plan should have backfired if JKR hadn't decided to write Dumbledore and McGonagall as some evil assholes who leave Harry out to dry and won't even protect him against such attacks.
