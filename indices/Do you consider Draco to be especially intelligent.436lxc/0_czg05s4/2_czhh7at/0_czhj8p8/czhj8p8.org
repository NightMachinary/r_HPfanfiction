Well, that's sort of true--but I would assume that most students aren't like Hermione, or she wouldn't be quite so impressive. Harry and Ron are shown to rely on her to check their essays a lot, Neville is just plain incompetent, a lot of the girls in their year are a tad ditsy...

By contrast, Draco is often talked about as being skilled at Potions (and he made it into the Potions NEWT, which takes very good grades) and he masters a lot of difficult magic at a normal if not slightly more rapid pace. He's driven and cunning, so even if he didn't apply himself to his grades I believe he would still strive for knowledge about things he cares about. I've always assumed him to be of higher intelligence.
