Draco is never really shown to struggle with his schoolwork until 6th year when he devoted himself to fixing the cabinet (a task of unknown difficulty to us). The [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Draco_Malfoy][wiki page]] on him is good for reminding us of the details though. He's skilled at Occlumency, which is not terribly easy. He must have done well on his OWLS, as he takes the NEWT classes in potions, transfiguration, and DADA. He picks up non-verbal magic early. And conjuring that snake in second year is apparently the sort of magic not generally taught until 6th, which is very impressive. Also, he eventually picks up alchemy as a hobby.

So, all of this points to him being quite intelligent. He probably doesn't have Hermione's natural brilliance, although even this is difficult to tell, because a lot of what makes Hermione so impressive is her work ethic, and Draco is not shown to be so dedicated to his academics.
