In a way, that's what should have happened.

If he doesn't kill himself or in a suicidal way immediately, I can definitely see him going mad and all out for revenge.

When he eventually learns that he's last the Horcrux, he will not offer himself up for execution, but will strap himself with enough Muggle bombs and magical explosives before challenging Voldemort for a duel. Then he blows everything into smithereens within a 500 meter radius.

Once in after life, he says his mission was accomplished and sorry to his friends. They all forgive him and go on happily together into their afterlives.

Meanwhile in Britain, Dumbledore still lives, and if he has learnt any lessons (which I hope), he will finally stop manipulating his (Ex) students to do his dirty work and take the lead himself. He can use the last decade of his life to thoroughly cleanse Wizarding Britain from all remaining Death Eater filth.
