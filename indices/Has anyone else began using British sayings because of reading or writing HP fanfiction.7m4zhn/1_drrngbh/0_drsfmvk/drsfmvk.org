I had to give a presentation years ago on the History of Maths, unfortunately it started as "Hello, I'm talking to you today about the History of Magic." Got lots of hopes up only to be dashed.

I've also been given cough syrups and other liquid medicines and referred to them as potions more times than I can count. People must think I'm a bit odd.

Also ITT people saying 'Brilliant' is a British-ism. As a Brit I did not know this.
