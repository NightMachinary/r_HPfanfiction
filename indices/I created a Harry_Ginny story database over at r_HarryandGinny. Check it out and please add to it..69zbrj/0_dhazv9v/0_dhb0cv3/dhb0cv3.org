Well, that's like, your opinion, man.

But seriously...the subreddit exists so people who really like the pairing can have discussions on it and not feel like we're constantly bombarding the main [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] or this sub with posts about them. Also, the community is for those who really like the pairing and this prevents others who aren't fans from potentially derailing the discussions or otherwise force supporters of the pairing from constantly having to defend it.

I specifically created that thread because the wiki, while great, isn't organized by genre of fics, and honestly I'm not sure how I'd go about adding that feature to the existing wiki. Perhaps once the thread I created has run its course, if it ever does, I can try to import it to the wiki. Also, anyone can add to my thread just like they can add to the wiki.
