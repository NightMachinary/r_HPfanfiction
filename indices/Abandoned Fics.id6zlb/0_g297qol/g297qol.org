I think 4 or 5 of my top 10 are abandoned.

That said, I typically read fanfiction for the creativity and worldbuilding, so unless the plot is really something special it doesn't affect me that much.

If the fic abandons at a logical point (at the end of a story arc) or after an initially high-stakes premise has devolved into a soap-opera-esque adventure, that's almost as good as complete for me. It's the ones that had a really interesting plot and just cut off somewhere in the middle of an arc that hit the hardest.
