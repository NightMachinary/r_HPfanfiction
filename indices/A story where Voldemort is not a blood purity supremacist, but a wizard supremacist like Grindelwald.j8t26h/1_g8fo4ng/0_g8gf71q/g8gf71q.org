Actually the only Voldemort that makes sense is a Voldemort-supremacist (anyone who isn't him is inferior). He uses the hatred of the rich and influential families for the Muggleborns to give them a cause to fight for and support him. However from Hagrid suggesting that he tried to recruit Harry's parents, the fact that he worked with giants and werewolves, it may seem that he doesn't really care what you are as long as he can make you a powerful yet obedient soldier fighting for his supremacy.
