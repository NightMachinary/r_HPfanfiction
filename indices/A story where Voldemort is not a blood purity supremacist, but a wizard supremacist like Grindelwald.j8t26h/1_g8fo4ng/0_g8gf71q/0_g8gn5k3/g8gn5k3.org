That's why that doesn't make sense... he's not giving his followers anything really. And he doesn't stick to his ideals or really even represent them. He would actually have needed to build a system of superiority before enforcing subjugation.

A wizard supremacist has a platform to garner wide scale agreement (rather than just the few and influential), target a group that can't effectively argue against him because they don't know he exists (muggles), and enforces a easy set of beliefs that actually looks like progress while also emphasising the importance of the past without alienating new comers.
