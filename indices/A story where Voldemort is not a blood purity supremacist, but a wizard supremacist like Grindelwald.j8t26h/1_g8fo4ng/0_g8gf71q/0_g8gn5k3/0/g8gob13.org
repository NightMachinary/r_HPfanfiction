In the books he doesn't even take any position of authority, opting to name a puppet minister and a puppet headmaster of Hogwarts. He basically allows the Death Eaters to run the world as they please, while he prefers to remain a threat in the shadows. He only takes charge when situation becomes critical, but otherwise he is more interested in the power he holds over the people. In my headcanon, he wants to be a god, above Muggles and above Wizards who changes the world order based on a whim.
