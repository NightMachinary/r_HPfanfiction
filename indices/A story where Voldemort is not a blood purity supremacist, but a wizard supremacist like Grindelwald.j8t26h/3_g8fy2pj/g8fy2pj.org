I think linkffn(11752324) and its sequel linkffn(12934044) fit, albeit loosely.

It is a very well written AU of a female Riddle that helps out Harry (to an extent). It does a great job of exploring her character, and I binge-read Limpieza de Sangre in one day. Its sequel is incomplete though, and I am dying for an update.
