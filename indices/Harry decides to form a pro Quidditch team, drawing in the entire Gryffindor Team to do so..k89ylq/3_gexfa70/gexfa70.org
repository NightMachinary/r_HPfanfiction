I love this idea! To be perfectly honest, I think Harry should have gone pro like Ginny in canon. Not that he wouldn't be a great Auror, but he spent his childhood fighting dark wizards. One would have thought he got tired of it. I know most people argue that his dislike of publicity would stop him from becoming a Quidditch player, but the fact is, most athletes become pro not because of publicity, but because they love the sport. There are plenty of real-world athletes who dislike media attention.

Sorry for the rant
