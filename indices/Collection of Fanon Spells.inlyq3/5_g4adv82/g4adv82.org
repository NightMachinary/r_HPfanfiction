I've recently started both collecting other's spells and coming up with my own. Here's a few that might be cool in a battle:

Combustum Aeros :: The Burning-Air curse. Causes a person's skin to burn on contact with air. Makes breathing rather difficult.

Wrecendes Wind :: The Wrecend Wind spell. An Old English spell that creates a blast of wind that will both drive back an enemy and flay their skin a bit.

Ambulo Quartusum :: The fourth direction charm. Causes the user to walk along the forth physical dimension. Useful to get past obstacles, and can actually be used to sneak into places undetected because you physically don't exist in the standard three dimensional space.
