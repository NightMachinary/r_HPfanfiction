Spells? I got some spells...

Spider Touch charm - Arachnitacta - gives target ability to stick their hands and feet to surfaces at will; takes practice to use properly

Cauterizing hex - Exuro viscus - literally burn flesh, it is used to seal wounds, though it does leave a scar

Transcription charm - Legendisce - it means 'learn by reading', in a way

Ragdoll Hex - Mortuus Lacertosus - translated as 'Deaden Muscles'. Unlike a petrify, the body is limp and moveable and can feel everything, but also unlike a petrify the caster must keep the hex on the target or the effect fades quickly (just not immediately)

Zipper-making spell - Obfirma Yoshi - creates a fucntional zipper in a layer (or layers) of fabric; also obfirma tergus yoshi - zippering for leather, which also works on skin to gruesome effect

Animagus revealing spell - Restituo Clementia - restore humanity

Creeping Paralysis hex - Rigor Tergum - 'Freeze flesh', an alternative to Petrificus Totalus better suited to healing. It petrifies the area at the point of contact. The longer the wizard holds the spell on the target, the further the paralysis spreads. Better than Full Body-bind in that a strong and focused wizard could use it to petrify any beast, no matter how large

Blood Clotting spell - siccarus cruor - stops the leak by extracting moisture; siccarus can also be used to make jerky and dried fruit

Stasis charm - Tempus Adversor - Prevents age or rot; usually used on prepared food, but the caster is not informed how long the effect will last

Numbing charm - Torpeo - very useful in healing

Aging charm - Vicis Sarcina - spell to make target appear older, usually around year per twist

Potion-aging charm - Ars Vicis Sarcina - accelerates the effect of a temporary transfiguration (5 minutes per twist), developed as a counter to polyjuice when refinements made it easier to store and use as a lozenge
