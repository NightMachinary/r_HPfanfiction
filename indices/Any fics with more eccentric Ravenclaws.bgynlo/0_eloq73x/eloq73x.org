I read something like that recently... Harry was a Slytherin, I think, and the mood was pretty light.. let's see if I can remember!

Edit: I'm sorry, but it doesn't seem to come to me. The Ravenclaws had more or less mediocre marks because they always got lost in their independent research, sometimes they would spend days sequestered in their tower. They lost quite some points because they didn't turn homework in on time because of getting sidetracked. Cannot remember anything specific about the doc though, only that Harry and his friends had a lot of house unity going on.
