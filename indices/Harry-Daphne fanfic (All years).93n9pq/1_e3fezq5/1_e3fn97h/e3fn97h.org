Do you love the Harry Potter world or Harry Potter the character? For me its the world, I want to explore that. If I wanted nice things for Harry he gets Ginny, his happily ever after and its all done before he's 20. DG is a pureblood, through her we can explore the wizarding world of Harry Potter. Some people take this to be some pureblood culture stuff which is often awful but it allows them to leave Hogwarts. We want to see more of the magical world.

An alternative use of her is to explore post war reconciliation. If Harry can move on with a pureblood then shouldn't everyone. Would people see him as a traitor? Potential conflict and therefore stories. What about if she's funny, beautiful, great at handling his fame, shame she's just a bigot. Can Harry reconcile his attraction to that, we have conflict and that's a story.

Another way she crops up is people think Harry is an idiot but don't want to write a Slytherin Harry. Slytherin is about cunning, about winning, about doing whatever it takes to come out on top. Harry does dumb shit because its the 'right' thing to do. People writing fix-it fics sometimes use her to make Harry's plans less bold and more planned.

She's an OC that can be almost anything you want but she's more legitimate than an oc to most people. Most people see OCs as shitty self inserts which really isn't helped by the number of people who make them as Draco/Harry's twin who is everyone's best friend and the cleverest person ever.
