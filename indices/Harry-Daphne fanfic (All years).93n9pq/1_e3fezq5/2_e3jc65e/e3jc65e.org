I think the fundamental reason is pretty simple. Daphne is a mostly-blank slate that can fulfill an otherwise empty role; she's a pretty pure-blood 'princess' who isn't evil. There's no one else like that to ship Harry with.

We know basically nothing about her or her family, other than that they're part of the sacred 28. That, combined with the fact that there was no mention of her or her parents supporting/sympathizing with Voldemort, means that she's the best canon compliant fit for the role.
