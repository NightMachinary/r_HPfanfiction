Wow! Lemme help.

So, Daphne Greengrass is the elder sister of Astoria Greengrass(who marries Draco Malfoy). The house of Greengrass is one of the Sacred 28 houses(not emphasized much in books). And that's where canon finishes.

Let's go fanon. The most agreeable and cliched version of Daphne portrayed in fanfics is that of a beautiful blonde Slytherin girl, who is like an Ice Queen. That is, seniors and classmates are reluctant to approach her romantically because of her frosty persona. Now she is shown mostly as the heiress to her house, and usually wields political knowledge. This opens up possibilities of her as Harry's love interest to those of us fanfic lovers, who can't imagine Harry with Ginny, and are tired of him with Hermione.

It's interesting because Harry dates a Slytherin. Which is by far the highlight, as everyone is shocked by the Gryffindor pride to associate with a Slytherin. We as authors can develop her like an OC, which is helpful to our storyline.
