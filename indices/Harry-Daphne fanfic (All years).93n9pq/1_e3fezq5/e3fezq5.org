Can someone explain the Daphne Greengrass phenomenon to me?

I'm new to the fanfic fandom. All I could discover was a picture of a blonde from the movies. Where did this originate as a point of fascination with authors?

Sorry to the author that this is off-topic. But if someone explains this to me, I may perhaps venture to read one, and why not this one(an DG story, that is) :)
