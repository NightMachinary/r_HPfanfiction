First few points before I get to the details of what your story is. Firstly, its very American. Late night games and /mail/ vans aren't things on this side of the pond. Please stop replying to reviewers, at least at the top of your story. Its a mess and I should never have to put effort into finding the story when I have 750,000+ others to choose from. Your Hagrid is a bit off but better than most. I do hope he's gone soon or else your story will become rather clunky.

Otherwise, you've set yourself a really ambitious first story. 7 years is a lot. JKR needed 1,084,170 words for it and a decade. Now, you're not after professional editing or anything like that but you've got a lot of work ahead of you. Sure plenty of authors have managed that many words, god only knows how MegaMatt keeps pumping them out, best not ask, but still, its an awful lot you've set yourself for a first story. Especially when you have lots of ideas that you would 'like to bounce around'.

Personally I will not be reading more of this. I've read almost every HP/DG story but I won't be reading this because it doesn't match my taste. The style isn't bad but anyone who isn't a fan of Fantastic Beasts, like myself will likely drop at your first chapter. I'd also warn about building too much mystery. It can be good, hook people in and make them ask what comes next but you've dumped a lot of hints and with a potential seven years to bog the pacing down it might become less mystery more frustration.
