Thanks. Yeah, it seems iffy, especially since the Disability Superpower is "packaged" with the disability in a lot of fics, and this one in particular.

And then, there's the distinction between extrinsic "power-ups" and skills developed to function despite the impairment. It's natural for deaf!Hermione to work very hard to learn nonverbal casting as early as possible, and she is likely to be able to do so; and similarly for her to try to master Legilimency, which she very well could. (A possible parallel is that a blind person who masters human echolocation would be better at operating in complete darkness than a sighted person.) Is that different? I don't know.

Of course, that's where the other issue with this fic is: she develops compensatory powers/skills, but she isn't shown actually /using/ them in interesting ways, because the author also stripped away a big chunk of her personality, including many of the parts that make her an interesting character, rather than an [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspirationallyDisadvantaged][Inspirationally Disadvantaged]] person to Harry. (And, yes, there's a TV Trope for that.)
