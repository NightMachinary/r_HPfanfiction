Interesting rec... It's better than the summary suggests and the first chapter makes it sound (as they make it sound like Hermione's only purpose in life is to teach the SlightlyMoreBadassThanCanon!Harry Important Life Lessons while being Someone To Protect --- and while there's some of that, there's relatively little), and yet,

- It's kind of annoying how it shaves off all of Hermione's rough edges. I get that the author wanted to show Hermione's quiet strength but, well, Hermione isn't quiet. I get that her personality might have developed differently, but I'd have liked to see just how; and a few interludes at the end of each chapter are woefully inadequate.
- For a more concrete example, it casually mentions that Hermione can cast nonverbally (and wandlessly, a little bit). I don't know how I feel about [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower][Disability Superpowers]] (but, as a hearing person, who am I to judge?), but that she doesn't ever do it, in order to fit in. (Hermione's tendency to show off at every opportunity was an important part of her personality. Character flaws are important, dammit!)
- I am honestly conflicted by whether it's a good thing that Hermione's life isn't significantly affected by her friendship with Harry. On the one hand, I absolutely /loathe/ fics that postulate that Hermione would be constantly bullied and/or die and/or withdraw from Hogwarts and/or be generally miserable without Harry in her life, with her life quickly improving once UsuallyMoreBadassThanCanon!Harry enters her life and begins Defending her Honor. On the other hand, with Harry gaining a better understanding of magic, becoming a better person, etc., what does Hermione get out of the relationship?
- Apparently, Hermione's low-key actions have had a significant effect on the plot, often without Harry knowing about them, and they continue to have them. That's a deviation from canon, and it'd have been interesting to read about. But, we don't get to see Hermione actually /doing/ them, just hear Harry learning about them after the fact, often from a third character.
- Along similar lines, there are some interesting missed opportunities. Legilimency is mentioned early on as a substitute for hearing. It's unclear how much she does in the fic, but it raises an interesting question that could have been explored: how /would/ the society look from the point of view of someone who effectively hears thoughts instead of sounds?
- What's with the pointless Weasley bashing?
