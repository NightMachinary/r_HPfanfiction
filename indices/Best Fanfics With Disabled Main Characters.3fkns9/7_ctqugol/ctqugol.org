The amateur anthropologist in me wants to see the statistics for what fraction of such fics have each of the following features:

1. The disability is compensated for by a power that effectively negates it, and then some.
2. The power does not negate it but provides benefits to the point where many intelligent, well-adjusted people would have made the trade voluntarily.
3. The disability is a plot device for the disabled character to be protected/rescued and then romanced by the protagonist.
4. The disabled character exists primarily to teach important life lessons to the protagonist.
