I know what you mean, I myself like to put it in super-disability category, like Daredevil, Doctor Mid-Nite or Echo.

Now that you mention it, I totally forgot linkffn(Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches) has main character with "disability". It gets healed (at least partially, some would argue about whether the other condition is "magical disability" or not) later in the fic or in the sequel.

If you don't mind super-disability, give it a go, if you do, you've been forewarned and can skip the fic.
