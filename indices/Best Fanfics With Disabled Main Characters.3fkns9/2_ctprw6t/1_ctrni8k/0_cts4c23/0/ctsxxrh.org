Thanks for the elaboration. It's a bit more of a literal answer than I was hoping for --- in that I wonder whether whether if an impairment (to use proper terminology) is a major part of the premise, it is betraying the premise to bring in a compensatory superpower that is "better" than the lost capability in enough ways and to the point where you'd expect people to take on such an "impairment" voluntarily.

(As an odd parallel, there's /Star Trek/: If you use technology superior to biology to compensate for congenital impairment, you are Geordi LaForge; but dare to use technology superior to biology to enhance functionality without a "good reason", and you are Borg.)
