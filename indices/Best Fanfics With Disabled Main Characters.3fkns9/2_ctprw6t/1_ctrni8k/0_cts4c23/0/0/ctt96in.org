It would depend on what the author is trying to portray by using impairments. Disability is a continuum, for some people having an impairment compelety deroads their life there's no question about that. For others an impairment can improve or add a uniqueness to their life. There are numerous disabled artists and authors whose life experiences after becoming disabled gave them assess to aspects of the world they previously had no conceptions of. Not exactly a superpower, but it suggests that impairment isn't all negative and that there is a positive side.

I would prefer people to write fics that explore something like: meeting people you'd never usually meet/associate with or encountering whole different aspects of the world. Rather than the daredevil effect, where impairments is the counter weight or vehicle to an awesome superpower.
