If it helps in sociology we separate impairment from disability. For example, impairment is defined as the physical/medical issues of body, whereas disability is defined as the social, political and/or physical barriers that disable people with impairments from being able integrate into society.

In a world of magic where magic can be used to as an enabling/supporting device disability as a social construct or physical barrier is diminished. What impairments are debilitating in a magical world is then called into question. Is blindness really a disability or impairment as a wizard if you can see with more accuracy than a normal eye? Or losing a limb as traumatic/tragic when a prosthetic is equal or superior to the original? Many people in the disability movement feel that if the adequate arrangements were made that supported/were sympathetic to their impairments then they would no longer be disabled. For instance, people in the Deaf (capital D) community do not consider themselves to be disabled and many don't associate being deaf as an impairment as deafness does not negatively impact their lives.
