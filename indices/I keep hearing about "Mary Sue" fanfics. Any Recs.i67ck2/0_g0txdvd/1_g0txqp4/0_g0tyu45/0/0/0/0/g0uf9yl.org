A Mary Sue is the opposite if the Everyman. Although I disagree with the other commenter on what an Everyman is. I generally see the Everyman as someone like Luke Skywalker or Frodo Baggins: someone who's kind of thrust into a situation and is an average joe, but grows into a hero over time. It sounds like what they're talking about is the same, but without the character growth, which I agree would be pretty poor writing.

The Mary Sue is a goddess, perfection incarnate, who can do no wrong without even trying. Everyone likes her, even her enemies, and those who don't either begrudgingly respect her or are considered to be egregiously in the wrong. There's no struggle or real threat against the Mary Sue, because nothing can truly harm her. If she does die, it's always a self-sacrifice filled with beauty and despair, and never due to a failing on her part. She never fails, she never progresses (for what is there to to progress to when you're already perfect?), she's never wrong, she's...

Well, she's an overpowered bitch with little to no real character beyond being perfect. The trope started as fanfiction authors' self-inserts who were written as, essentially, the idealized versions of themselves, going into the story and having all the characters they like loving them, and fixing all the problems in the world that no one else could. It's boring and really shitty story-telling, and over the years has leaked out into mainstream media (tv, movies, etc., not the news). See: Ma-Rey Sue from the new Star Wars Films.
