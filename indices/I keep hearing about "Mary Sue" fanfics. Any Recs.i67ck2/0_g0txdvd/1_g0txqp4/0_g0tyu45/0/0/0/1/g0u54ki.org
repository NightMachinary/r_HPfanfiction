An everyman Is painfully average in every way.

A true Average Joe.

Passive, goes with the flow.

Boring.

Passive, doesn't advance plot.

I came here to read action scenes and crackish/chaotic slice of life fics, I want action or fluff, I don't want this Joe Schmo incapable of picking a lock, I want CHAOS. Long reign the Alpacca-lypse!

Anyway, I just hate the trope. It perfectly fine if you like it tho.
