[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue][Mary Sue, on TV Tropes]]

--------------

in my opinion:

It's a female character that "can do no wrong", and bends the story elements to go along with this... It's this bending that tends to put people off of such fics, and Mary Sue / Gary Stue^{male version} thus tends to be used as a derogatory term.

My Imortal is an extreme case of Mary Sue, I would recommend at least watching some of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ffh7cWRrqF4][Internet Historian's reading of it]].

It's actually kind of hard to recommend any Mary Sue fic (at least for me) as any fic which I would remember/have read/want to recommend which might be considered Mary Sue would end up being so mild as to not trigger that connotation in my mind. ^{I think I might actually repress parts where these themes crop up automagically; so as to enjoy a story I'm reading}
