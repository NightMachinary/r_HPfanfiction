The above comments have done a really good job hashing out what a straight Mary Sue is, so I'm just gonna rec some stuff you might like. It looks like you're looking for hypercompetent characters rather than a straight Sue, so I'll point you in that direction.

We'll start with *Victoria Potter*. Victoria is a smarter, more intuitive, more cunning, more attractive version of Harry who's sorted into Slytherin in a subtly AU world. Is she a Mary Sue? That's up to you. Is the story damn good, well written, and presents challenges to the protagonist? Absolutely.

You might also want to check out *The Pureblood Pretense*, somewhat of a crossover with Alanna the Lioness, which again features a smarter, more intuitive, more cunning version of Harry who swaps places with her male cousin to attend a pureblood-only version of Hogwarts. It's a straight power fantasy complicated only by the protagonist's slowly dissociating identity and involvement in all different corners of the wizarding world. This one's long.

*The Arithmancer* has a genius Hermione who instead of a bookworm is a math whiz, and IIRC has much better social skills than her canon self. It's a whole million-plus-word saga that's quite good, if draggy in parts.

There are more fics that have hypercompetent female characters in leading roles, but this should give you a good start. I can list some of those characters in a further comment if you want.
