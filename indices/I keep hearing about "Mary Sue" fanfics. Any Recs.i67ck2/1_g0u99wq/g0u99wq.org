First, we need to define a Mary Sue. So, what is a Mary Sue ?

A Mary Sue is a character who has no difficulties during the entirety of the plot. The only ones refusing to be their friends are the bad guys, or maybe that emo gothic dude/girl who'll later bang the Mary Sue after two whole chapters of angst and "I'm sure behind that cold exterior is a heart of gold".

A Mary Sue is friend with everyone, except when the author doesn't want his character to be seen as a Mary Sue, at which point he will introduce *le gasp* conflict between characters. Expect the conflict to last as long as 5k words.

A Mary Sue has little to no difficulties practicing anything. They are a natural at everything, or they take to it extremely fast.

A Mary Sue's opponents are ALWAYS evil, and in the wrong. That, or they redeem themselves after one wrong deed and a confrontation with the Mary Sue.

A Mary Sue's kindness is infinite, and everyone should sing how much the Mary Sue is a perfect person and the world doesn't deserve them.

​

If your character is all of this except he's a boy, then- uh oh, this is not a Mary Sue! But it is, instead, a not-less-rare specy known as a Gary Stu. Which is the same thing but again, for dudes.

​

To put things into perspective : if something bad happens to the character *while the story is ongoing* (not as a flashback or as background information), to make him or her progress as a person and a character, then it's probably not a Mary Sue.

​

Now, I would rec some fics, but I make a point of honor to not recommand anything I find badly written.
