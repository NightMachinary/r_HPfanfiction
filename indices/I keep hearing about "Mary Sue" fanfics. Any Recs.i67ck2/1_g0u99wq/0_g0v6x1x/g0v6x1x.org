  To put things into perspective : if something bad happens to the character while the story is ongoing (not as a flashback or as background information), to make him or her progress as a person and a character, then it's probably not a Mary Sue.

My caveat is that the struggle should inflect change/character growth on the MC. So many Mary Sue fics have a token conflict so that the author can claim 'S/he's not a Mary/Gary Sue!"
