It's a nice story... A lot of things happening all over the place, gave me anxiety. But after reaching chapter 25-26, I don't think I can continue anymore. Don't wanna spoil for others but a lot of character death made me so sad. A good story but not for me.

As someone who liked Honor thy blood, I don't think this is like that. At least not to me but I stopped at ch 26.
