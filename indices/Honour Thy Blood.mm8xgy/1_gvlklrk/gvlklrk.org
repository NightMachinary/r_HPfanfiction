[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12317784/1/Stepping-Back][Stepping Back]] which is coincidentally by the same author is something along the lines of Honor Thy Blood. An amazing Time Travel fic with a Bellatrix/Harry pairing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/11649002/JustBored21][JustBored21]] is an amazing author when it comes to OP/God-like Harry fictions where Harry trains /before/ he comes to Hogwarts. Usually based on a Haphne pairing or Hinny and comes with a lot of Dumbledore, Hermione, and Selective Weasley Bashing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13319565/1/Harry-Black-Book-1-The-Hero-s-Return][Harry Black: Book 1]] is a raised by Sirius fanfiction where Harry trains and joins Hogwarts late. It has a Haphne pairing as well and features the amazing minor character of Michael Corner.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11002763/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Magic-of-Life][Harry Potter and the Magic of Life]] also falls under these lines, though Harry is less trained and instead is taken on a curse-breaking expedition with Bill Weasley. This again has a Haphne pairing. It is complete and has a sequel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776013/1/Blood-of-the-Phoenix][Blood of the Phoenix]] is an amazing book featuring Harry paired with an OC. Happens after Goblet of Fire over the summer, where Harry meets a 'phoenix' and finds more about his life than he ever could. There is teen pregnancy and a slight older/younger relationship but don't discount that.
