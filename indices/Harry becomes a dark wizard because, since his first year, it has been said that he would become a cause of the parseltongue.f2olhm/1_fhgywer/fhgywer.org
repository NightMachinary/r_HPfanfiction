I remember reading a rather dark crack fic where it's illegal to be a parselmouth, and when some wizard finds a pre-Hogwarts aged Harry Potter talking to snakes (like 6 or 7 yo), he's carted off to Azkaban. So you have this stupid baby thinking that he's going to be great and terrible and that Azkaban is his lair, and any jailer with even an ounce of kindness plays along because he's just a stupid little baby and what's wrong with their world!!
