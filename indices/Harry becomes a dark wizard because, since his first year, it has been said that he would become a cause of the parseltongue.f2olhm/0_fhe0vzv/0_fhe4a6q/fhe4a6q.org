Is it not plausible, from a psychological point of view and in a serious context? My friend had brought me as an example the children of people in prison who, if bullied and labeled as criminals, could become so.

Because my friend says that a child does not yet have a solid perception of "self" and solid personality it's much more malleable and subject to external influences.
