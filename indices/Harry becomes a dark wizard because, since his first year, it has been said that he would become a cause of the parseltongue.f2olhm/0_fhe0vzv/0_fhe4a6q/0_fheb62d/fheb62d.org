Yep. Definitely a thing, though as much a Pop Psychology thing as an actual one. Labelling is quite often ridiculously effective though. Tell a kid they'll be something or that they are something often enough, especially something bad, and they'll often become it. It's called, somewhat appropriately, a self-fulfilling prophecy. Works with positive stuff too, mind. You can build a child up and help them decide to grow.

Generally, the more self-possessed will fight back against it, but it's pretty regularly deterministic at young ages. Not enough to be utterly conclusive in research and studies and whatnot, but enough that we know it often works.
