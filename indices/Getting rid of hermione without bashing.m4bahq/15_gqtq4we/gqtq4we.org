On Halloween 1991, Harry and Ron are looking forward to the feast.

  Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.

  And that way, it remained, until they reached the Gryffindor Common Room, where Percy had led them, after all the hubbub about the troll, and a headcount revealed Hermione Granger was missing.

  She was searched for immediately, but it was too late: The troll had somehow managed to climb up to the third floor, and a first year witch, no matter how clever, was no match for an angry troll. Hogwarts was very solemn when Headmaster Dumbledore announced her death at breakfast the next morning.
