Ron being callous about creature rights is perfectly in character. We see this with the elves, the giants, the goblins, and the werewolves. He doesn't change his mind about the elves until DH for example.

Harry's passivity is in the books too. He was on Ron's side about the elves, but kept quiet. He preferred to play quidditch and fuck around with Ginny as opposed to putting all of his effort in getting Slughorn's memory for instance. The second task in the Triwizard tournament was so nerve-wracking because Harry didn't want to deal with it until the last minute.

How is my suggestion bashing them when these things are perfectly in character for them? Harry and Ron do not stop having flaws just because you like them.

I'm guessing you'd have preferred that it be Hermione's insensitivity that drives Harry and Ron away. And it's believable for Ron, but that's bashing /Harry/ - Harry whose biggest virtue is forgiveness. I was assuming that the suggestions should keep all the characters in character.

I'm suggesting that the writer make Hermione more impatient than she was in the books. Have her get frustrated faster so she looks for friends with priorities that are more in line with hers. Then boom. Suddenly she's running in a different circle.

Sure. The polyjuice plan where she drugged and impersonated her classmates. The Rita Skeeter kidnapping and blackmailing scheme. The SNEAK jinx in the DA.

These are all things that Ron and Harry heartily approved of, but it was Hermione who knew how to plan, strategize, /and/ do the necessary magic to pull these off. So between the long-term planning and her greater magical ability? Yes, Hermione is more capable.

You go to Harry and Ron if you want someone bludgeoned to death. Otherwise, it's Hermione for the more complicated stuff.

(An aside, but the DA was more of Hermione's leadership than Harry's. He's the figurehead who teaches. The most he set was the schedule. She's the one who had the vision, did the actual planning, recruited both the students and instructor, motivated said instructor, and disciplined the traitor. Heck, we see this best in the very first meeting of the DA. Even when everyone looked to Harry as leader, it was /Hermione/ who set the agenda and led that meeting while Harry floundered.

And I know I know the people looked to Harry - but leadership is more complicated than just being liked enough that people follow you. A person followed but with no actual power is called a figurehead. As I demonstrated above.)
