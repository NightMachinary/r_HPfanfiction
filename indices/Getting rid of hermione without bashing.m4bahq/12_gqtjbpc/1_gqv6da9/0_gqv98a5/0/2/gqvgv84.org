OP wanted a point of divergence such that Hermione is written out of the picture without bashing. I proposed that given canon characterization at certain points in canon, they use said canonical characterization (eg. Ron's callousness in GoF, Harry's passivity in HBP) to drive Hermione away so that she makes new friends and does her business elsewhere.

OP did not ask us to write the plot or the character arcs for them. I have not claimed that Ron and Harry cannot change. Only that in certain places in canon (ie. specific moments in time), pushing certain character traits could drive the wedge OP wanted. They can change after wedge has become irreparable - I don't know, that wasn't what OP asked of us.

I'm going to admit that I forgot to add Hermione's canonical feelings of frustration and impatience to the mix (I thought it would have been obvious tbh). So I added it in my second reply, and I am now reiterating it here. Hermione's impatience kicks. Give her a group that is more in line with her priorities. Boom. No more Hermione in the story. She is too busy campaigning in the background to have time for Harry and Ron.

Anyway, I am not solely crediting Hermione for the polyjuice plan. I'm pointing out that the planning was all hers. I'm highlighting the ability for planning that neither Harry nor Ron exhibit. That makes her more capable at creating and executing complicated plans.

As for Rita Skeeter, why is Hermione's greater ability to gather information - and /use/ that information - not make her more capable? I am referring to capable as in able to execute. And she executed something that neither Harry nor Ron did. That makes her more capable (at planning and executing).

As for the DA, yes Harry /taught/. That makes him a /teacher/. Teaching involves skills in both expertise and leadership. The things you pointed out (eg. communicating information, and setting the curriculum - which we have no evidence he did by the way) fall under expertise. Leadership skills in teaching such as motivation, administration, and discipline were all done and decided by Hermione.

(Planning is also a leadership skill by the way.)

Put it this way, Harry is the teacher, Hermione is the principal. The administrative (ie. leadership) position is Hermione's not Harry's.

Now about Hermione only being an enforcer. That is only possible if Harry created the policies upon which she is enforcing. But Hermione created the policies too (ie. secrecy, vision, goals). If anything, it is the other way around. Hermione set the goals (eg. teach students how to defend themselves properly), and Harry is enforcing that. And he is enforcing it in the structure Hermione built.

About HBP, I thought we were arguing about Harry and Hermione in the DA? That was what I was talking about when I called Harry a figurehead. Your evidence is outside the scope of the argument.

Final point: again, I did not suggest a plot or character arc for the OP. I'm simply pointing out a point of divergence that would write Hermione out. OP can easily use my suggestion and have her do centaur campaigns in the background that Harry and Ron have absolutely no interest in. They can have Harry and Ron do their missions while Hermione is preoccupied doing something else after they ditch her for her methods.

(Also, I just pointed out her ruthlessness. How exactly is that glorifying her?)

I don't know. I'm not the one writing the plot or the character arcs.

Anyway, I'm ending the conversation here. You and OP can do what you wish with my suggestions.
