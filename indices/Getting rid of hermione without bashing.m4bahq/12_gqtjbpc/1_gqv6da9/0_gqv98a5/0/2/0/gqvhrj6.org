  About HBP, I thought we were arguing about Harry and Hermione in the DA? That was what I was talking about when I called Harry a figurehead. Your evidence is outside the scope of the argument.

No, it isn't. Harry /ordered/ the DA to keep an eye out. Ordered. Which, quite obviously, makes him the leader. As much as /you/ want her to be, Hermione isn't the leader. She didn't go ahead with the plan until Harry agreed and approved. That makes her the sole member of the planning committee, not the leader of the entire organisation.

Anyways, the rest of your comment is suitably covered by this-
