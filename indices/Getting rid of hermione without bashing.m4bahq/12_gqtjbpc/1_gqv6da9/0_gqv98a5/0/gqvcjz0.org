  How is my suggestion bashing them when these things are perfectly in character for them? Harry and Ron do not stop having flaws just because you like them.
#+end_quote

You're suggestion makes them less intelligent than they are, and assumes that they don't have the potential to change. Harry can stop being passive. Ron can become more sensitive. If the author chooses to make Hermione more ruthless and proactive, and doesn't extend any of that goodwill to Harry and Ron, that's bashing.

And really, "don't stop having flaws"... How about Hermione's emotional weakness or her arrogance disrupting her plans? That just can't happen eh? Harry and Ron are essential to ensure Hermione's negative character traits are put in check.

  I'm guessing you'd have preferred that it be Hermione's insensitivity that drives Harry and Ron away.
#+end_quote

Not really. Hyping up Hermione's insensitivity is bashing her, which is extremely lazy. I don't want to blame Hermione for the split. It needs to be mutual if the author wants to avoid bashing.

  I was assuming that the suggestions should keep all the characters in character.
#+end_quote

Your previous suggestion hypes up Hermione into a far more proactive and important role, which is vastly OOC ¯_(ツ)_/¯

  The polyjuice plan where she drugged and impersonated her classmates.
#+end_quote

She needed both Harry and Ron's help for this one. Hermione doesn't get the sole credit for that stunt.

  The Rita Skeeter kidnapping and blackmailing scheme. The SNEAK jinx in the DA.
#+end_quote

This makes her better at collecting information and more willing, not more capable.

  her greater magical ability
#+end_quote

Greater magical ability... She had to be taught by Harry in the DA, it was Harry who drove a hundred Dementors away and it was Harry who resisted Voldemort's Imperius, but sure, Hermione has greater magical ability. The Hermione Bias is getting too thick now.

Also, Hermione is not the leader of the DA. Planning stuff doesn't make her the leader. Harry taught the DA, he was the best at magic among all of them, he decided the lessons and spells to be taught by himself and he motivated the DA to learn more. When Hermione struggled with the Patronus, it was Harry who helped her.

All the stuff you mentioned makes her an enforcer, not the ultimate position of power. Harry is not a figurehead. When push comes to shove, /Harry/ is the one everyone looks to, not Hermione. This is made quite clear in HBP, where Hermione panicked and looked to Harry when the Death Eaters invaded the castle.

Your entire comment seems to focus on glorifying everything Hermione does as much as possible while writing off Harry's achievements.

In any case, my original point still stands. OP wanted Hermione to be a background character, not the main protagonist.
