It's clear from the start as he's the main motivator and order giver. But for all of my dislike of the last 3 books, she does have Harry fully step into that role when he needs to.

When he keeps the DEs distracted in the DOM while coming up with a plan is my favorite. But having them patrol the school while he's away like Dumbledore has the order do was a nice touch.
