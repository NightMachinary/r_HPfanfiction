  That said, the most realistic way to have Hermione drift away from Harry and Ron is to play with her politics. Have her become frustrated with Ron's callousness with creature rights for example or get frustrated with Harry's passivity. Have Harry and Ron focus on their day-to-day lives while she puts more time and effort into her advocacies, missions, or the like. You can do this any time starting PoA, but especially in OotP and DH.

So, bash Harry and Ron (or make them look like idiots) and glorify Hermione? OP clearly asked for her to become a background character, not "perfect politician Hermione" who can do everything by herself.

  (I say tweak because Ron and Harry in canon are probably even more callous and willing to do immoral things than Hermione is - /she just happens to be more capable/.)

Proof? Hermione was a part of the DA and was taught by Harry, not the other way around. When shit hit the fan, it was Harry everyone looked to as the leader, not Hermione. Being better at collecting information doesn't make her more capable.
