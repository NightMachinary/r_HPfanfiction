It doesn't make her into a background character, but linkffn(Coven by Naidhe) does have her drift away from Ron and Harry in a realistic way.

The simplest way to turn her into a background character is probably just not have her be friends with them at all in the first place. Just make it so the Troll never happens and they stop being in each other's radars after a while.

The thing is that the biggest hurdle you'll be facing if you want her to drift away after they're already friends is that canon!Hermione is both extremely proactive and stupidly loyal. Shaking her off will be very difficult. More importantly, it would be up to Ron and Harry to actively shake her - like the Firebolt and Scabbers fight for example.

That said, the most realistic way to have Hermione drift away from Harry and Ron is to play with her politics. Have her become frustrated with Ron's callousness with creature rights for example or get frustrated with Harry's passivity. Have Harry and Ron focus on their day-to-day lives while she puts more time and effort into her advocacies, missions, or the like. You can do this any time starting PoA, but especially in OotP and DH.

Another way is to play with her ruthlessness. This would need a bit of tweaking on Harry and Ron's character, but you can have them be a bit more uncomfortable with her "ends justifies the means" mentality. (I say tweak because Ron and Harry in canon are probably even more callous and willing to do immoral things than Hermione is - she just happens to be more capable.)

The boys will probably have to be the ones who will to do the friendship break-up in both cases.
