I /love/ Coven! Whenever anyone asks for feminist themed, female friendship focused or realistic dark Hermione recs, Coven is my go to recommendation. It's the bane of my life that it's likely abandoned.

I could definitely see Hermione throwing herself into politics and seeing the things the boys get up to each year as small fry distractions. For example, have her be too busy organising for the liberation of mermaids to be able to spare energy for Harry's Triwizard adventures.
