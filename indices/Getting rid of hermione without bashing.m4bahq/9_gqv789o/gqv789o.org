Option 1- troll thing never happened- have Ron quietly say his complaint to harry or just not say it at all

Option 2- remove what made her interesting and solidified their bond- mcgonagall asks what happened and she tells the truth, she defends Harry and Ron by saying they were just trying to help her but at the same time she doesn't cover for them and pretend like they had no other choice and it's all her fault
