I mean the best way is just to not have her interact with Harry as much as she does in cannon. Like don't have her show up on the train with Neville and maybe have her go to another house. Don't have the troll corner her and don't have Ron pick on her etc, fill thouse scenes with other bodys.

I think having her fade into the background could be a bit problematic though, as her part in the 'golden trio' friendship is pretty important. If you are writing her out cause she is hard to write than I would suggest keeing her in as a challenge to become a better writer. Alternatively, you could tweak her character all you want, this is your work after all.
