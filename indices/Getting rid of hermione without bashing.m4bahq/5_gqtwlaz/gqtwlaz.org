Depends on how early you are diverging.

One neat idea is to have her start Hogwarts a year early, and then /not/ shoehorn her into Ron's and Harry's lives. (There is a number of mechanisms for having her start a year early that I've seen in fics.)

Sort her into Ravenclaw, sure, and then /don't/ make her a miserable damsel that needs to be rescued from her bullies. (If I had a dollar for every fic that...)

At Troll Time, if she makes her way back to the Gryffindor Tower before the Troll shows up, they are unlikely to become friends and would probably end up associating each other with hurt feelings and bad outcomes. (The potential pitfall there is that she'd probably be right there next to Neville trying to prevent Harry and Ron from wasting more of her hard-earned House Points in their absurd vendetta against Snape; she knows the Full Body Bind Curse, and she is not afraid to use it...)

Not having them reconcile in PoA could work---but if you don't want to kill off Sirius and Buckbeak, you'll need some other approach to rescuing them. (Actually, having Hermione /succeed/ in exonerating Buckbeak may suffice.)

Later on, it'd be harder to make them drift apart.
