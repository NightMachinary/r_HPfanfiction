Again, I think this is cherry-picking and selective interpretation of evidence. To characterise someone's argument this way is not an ad-hom, even if it's not particularly nice. (On the other hand, I feel that I should apologise for the "amateur psychoanalysis" around the canon-that-should-have-been. I am not very good at expressing sympathy without coming off as condescending, particularly in online arguments.)

I do think that we have a different hermeneutic when reading the books. When I see an apparent inconsistency, I operate under the assumption that it is due to my limited knowledge, which results from the limited perspective of the characters. In other words, Potterverse is internally consistent and populated with people, what is described as happening in the books actually happened in the Potterverse, and if I don't understand something, it's because I only get to see a small piece of the Potterverse.

So, for example, when I see Harry being helpless at the end of PS and then using a variety of jinxes at the Duelling Club, I do not dismiss one bit of evidence in favour of the other. Instead, I assume that both of these things happened in the book universe and, based on that, speculate what would account for that difference (e.g., spells Harry knew not being suitable for the situation or Harry learning the spells between those events and the Duelling club). I am not particularly attached to any given explanation, and I am open to others, but ultimately I incorporate /all/ evidence, not just the parts I prefer to be true.

On point, the way I see it, Harry is a very talented fighter due to his non-magical talents. I think that we can agree that Harry is an incredibly talented /athlete/, who made Seeker without any practice and killed a basilisk with a sword without any prior sword training. He also has an emotional disposition that lets him maintain focus and composure under fire and gives him a powerful Patronus but also makes him impulsive and easily baited (and makes it much harder for him to learn Occlumency, though that's more headcanon territory). These things let him punch significantly above his magical weight in magical combat: to go farther with what is ultimately a very limited arsenal of spells. (This, by the way, is a part of why grappling Hermione and Neville in that hypothetical scene might be a viable option, particularly if your hypothesis that no one would here were true.)

Against skilled adult wizards and witches, these talents have utility, particularly in ambushes and running battles, but not so much in pitched battles. In Bellatrix's, Snape's, and Molly's league, the athleticism-based jumpy style that teenagers use because of their small spell arsenals and having to cast verbally becomes less generally viable. Ironically, the best example of a magical duel between two highly skilled but not Dumbledore-tier adults that we see in the books is Molly vs. Bellatrix in DH.

Once we take these things into account, the general picture that emerges is that Harry has a significantly above average talent for learning magic (as does Ron, actually, though not to the same extent), but he doesn't actually learn general magic that much faster than his peers and has to work as hard as them to do it. (One possible exception is the Dark spells, though we know even less about those than we do about the others; I personally like the idea that they are actually easy to cast as long as you are succumbing to evil, because evil should be tempting.)

With the amount of effort Harry puts in, if he were truly ahead of the class, we would expect him to be the first person to perform a spell or a Transfiguration in class, but that honour invariably goes to Hermione, and that includes DADA skills like nonverbal casting. You can use that to claim that JKR is biased and disregard that very consistent part of canon, or you can accept that there are areas in which Hermione is more gifted than Harry. It's not the end of the world. There is no Fundamental Law of Fiction that says that the protagonist has to be better at literally everything than the sidekick.

Regarding who taught whom what, we know next to nothing about theory of magic and its importance, or what learning a spell actually feels like. For example, when Hermione was helping Harry with the Summoning Charm, IIRC she had him read stuff, then they pulled an all-nighter, and in the morning, Harry could do it. What insight did Harry get during that night? In what way was he different? We don't know. Similarly, what role did Ron and Hermione play in helping Harry learn spells? We don't know. (I do recall either Ron or Hermione commenting that they would be much better prepared for the OWLs now, so I think they learned at least some stuff right along.)

What the books do have is a pretty consistent distinction between knowing how to cast a spell and being able to use it effectively in combat---a distinction from which Hermione tends to suffer horribly. (Remember why they had to abandon 12 Grimmauld Place? If Hermione had used some spell that would have taken Yaxley out, they wouldn't have had to---a good example of Hermione being shown messing up and suffering the consequences, by the way.)

So, the way I see it, in DA, Harry had a lot to teach Hermione and even Fred and George (who had already passed their DADA OWLs), just in terms of being able to defend against their fellow human beings, even if he (hypothetically) didn't teach them a single spell.
