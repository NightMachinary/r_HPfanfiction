Well, first of all, I only promised /one/ dozen. :P

Secondly, very few of them I would recommend without reservation. (Almost all the unreserved recommendations are ensemble casts.)

Also, be warned: for me, unless there is some mystery that calls for a reveal at the end, an unfinished fic is just as enjoyable as finished. The enjoyment of reading comes during the reading, not at the end, and so it doesn't matter to me whether or not I will ever see the end. I know that many, perhaps most readers put much more weight on completedness.

Anyway, I'll try to put together a list, particularly if [[/u/Revenant14_]] is also interested.
