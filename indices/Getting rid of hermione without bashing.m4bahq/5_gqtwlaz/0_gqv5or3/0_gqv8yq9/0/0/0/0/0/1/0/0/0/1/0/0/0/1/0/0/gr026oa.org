  We have a very different understanding of what magical competency is, apparently. The rate at which Harry learns spells doesn't really matter. The fact that once mastered, his spells have much greater effects (beyond what the standard level is) shows that he is indeed far ahead of his classmates.

Eh? We were just talking about him learning spells and such and who taught whom. When I read that someone is "ahead" of their classmates, I read that as them learning material that others haven't yet---which means either learning faster or studying more. If what you meant was that Harry's spells are more powerful than others' of the same age, then why didn't you say so in the first place? (It's not particularly true except for the Patronus Charm, either, but that's a separate discussion.)

  This is not just for spells that depend on his emotional disposition. He uses the Impediment Jinx to violently banish and knock out a Death Eater in HBP, and the idea that his state of anger "powers" the spell is pure fanon.

Harry is far from the only one to knock people back with the Impediment Jinx, the Disarming Charm, Protego, etc., you know. Just do some keyword searches through the books.

By the way, I actually went back and looked up that scene. Basically, Harry ran on to the scene, hit some DEs who were distracted by fighting other people and not shielding or attacking him without a wand because savage werewolf. And then, the DEs ran away, because Snape had ordered a retreat, because their mission to assassinate Dumbledore had been accomplished. (And, Amycus was not knocked out, since Harry saw him running away right behind his sister immediately after.)

Oh, and the DEs were under orders /not/ to kill (or maim, presumably) Harry---at least according to Snape---which means fewer or no Dark curses aimed at him. I'd say that's about as good as an eighth's of a dose of Felix Felicis. Wouldn't you?

So, I don't think that it was a particularly interesting test of Harry's abilities, any more than the Diner scene in DH was Hermione's.

A related fun fact is that in the Department of Mysteries battle, the only one who was targeted with lethal and Dark magic was Hermione. The others---Harry and the pureblood children---were targeted with Stunners and hexes of the sort that can be healed quickly.

For that matter, there are far too many examples in canon where all kinds of magic is affected by emotional disposition and personality to call it "fanon". Off the top of my head Neville's progress, Lockhart's limitations, Harry's block on the Summoning Charm.

I didn't say Dark curses were easier to cast for an immoral person. I am saying that it makes all too much sense that Dark curses /want/ to be cast, make it easy to hurt and maim. It just seems like an interesting coincidence, that the only spells that Harry was able to cast without study or practice were the particularly nasty Dark curses. Now, Harry himself is more merciful than pretty much anyone else in the setting, including both of his friends, so I don't think it's about him, and so infer that it's about the curses.

  I have never denied that there are a few aspects in which Hermione is ahead of Harry. Indeed, her ability to understand and apply theory explained to her by someone quickly is much greater than Harry's. This makes her a better student, not a better witch/wizard.

Apologies for bluntness, but this is just plain untrue.

Firstly, it would be more accurate to say that there are a few aspects in which /Harry/ is ahead of /Hermione/. The only non-Dark magic that we see him master ahead of Hermione was Patronus, and that was because of the special lessons; he possibly learned the things he learned for TWT before Hermione---while Hermione was focused on helping him prepare. (More on that later.) Again, thanks to his non-magical traits, intense training, and experience, he is better applying the magic that he can do to combat than Hermione. On that, you won't get any disagreement from me. On everything else? Yes, Hermione is ahead of Harry.

Secondly, Hermione was casually learning spells from books alone before she even showed up at Hogwarts. Who explained them to her there? Her Muggle parents? Her casually showing up with a spell that Harry hasn't heard of is practically a running gag. Are these "biased" too?

During TWT, Ron and Hermione helped Harry research spells (and Harry mentions that explicitly), there is some speculation that Hermione invented the Four-Point Spell (though I think that's probably not the case), and they helped him practice his spells by casting jinxes at him. We don't get details, but to claim that they were just there for moral support is disingenuous.

On extraordinary results, how many of those did the others have the /opportunity/ to produce? Also, you do have things like a parchment jinx (again, researched from books and as a solo effort) that Madame Pomfrey couldn't reverse. Not as flashy as a Patronus, but pretty impressive, if you ask me.

The reason I seem to be uncharitable to Harry is that you are insisting on introducing highly exaggerated (in my opinion) descriptions of his performance and achievements, and I am stuck having to refute them.
