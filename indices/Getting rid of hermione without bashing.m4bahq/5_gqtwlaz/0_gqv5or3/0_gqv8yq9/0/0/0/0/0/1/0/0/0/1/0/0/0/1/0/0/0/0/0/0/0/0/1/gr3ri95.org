Uh huh, true enough. Why is that a problem exactly?

This is the exact same thing - increasing the amount of conflict Hermione faces to create tension.

Harry would not be content with sitting about and doing nothing. His ambition was to be an Auror and fight dark wizards. In HBP, he clearly stated his intention to fight Voldemort and his Death Eaters, /and/ kill as many of them as he could.

As for the "OC with Harry's name" part, that happens to be one of the worst arguments I've read. Personality is /supposed/ to change based on the challenges a person faces. If Harry grows and undergoes a change in personality, that's perfectly alright. On the Way to Greatness does this very, very well.

In any case, Hermione and Ron undergo massive changes in most fics which have them as MCs. They become more confident, leaving behind their canon insecurities, become more outspkoen, take on characteristics that Harry showed in canon (foolish bravery and quick-thinking being the most common traits) and are more inclined towards "leadership". Examples include Speed and Fate (both Ron-centric) and ACA and Arithmancer (both Hermione-centric).

It seems particularly unfair to demand that Harry remain the same as his canon self in all fics while Hermione and Ron are allowed to be changed according to the needs of the plot.

Why must Harry start of with his canon values? Canon Harry is basically the pinnacle of the modern "Perfect Hero" template. Brave, gallant, quick-thinking, cunning and smart only in stressful situations (but not when dealing with unimportant rivals), he's able to keep a cool head in situations others don't deal with well and holds himself to his own high moral standards.

This is pretty much what most "hero" characters have been for over a century. Superman, Thor, Luke Skywalker, Wonder Woman... Heck, even Spider-Man, although he's supposed to be a genius, ends up with a "brain-freeze" unless the plot demands otherwise.

Starting with a character like this is extremely lazy. It's much better to show a genius!Harry eventually grow into these characteristics and resemble canon Harry in many ways, hence /becoming/ a hero as opposed to natually being one. As far as I can see, this might be the general direction Victoria Potter is heading towards.

To tie down Harry to his canon traits /and/ character arc oppresively and declare that OP!Harry is boring, while applying no such rules to hypothetical scenarios involving Hermione and Ron is beyond unfair. It's hypocrisy at it's finest, no offense.

If Harry's outlook and studiousness towards magic is being increased to set him up as a Dumbledore-like wizard(while keeping his canon personality), the plot /must/ change. Not doing so would only lead to making all the characters around him look stupid at best, or outright bash them. What You Leave Behind is perhaps the best fic that demonstrates this. Canon Harry with incentive and drive to be a magical genius, faces an appropriate amount of challenges to make the story interesting.

Let's just say we reverse the kind of examples you're providing -

A more powerful Harry would take a more active role in the struggle against Voldemort. Voldemort would adjust to this Harry's superior intellect and create more complex plans to beat him. Harry's fight against the Death Eaters and Voldemort ends up being quite interesting.

Super!Ron is still jealous, still has an inferiority complex, still envies Harry at times and doesn't step up and accept his feelings for over 6 years. He ends up wasting his potential as he has to overcome his own personal problems. Boring.

Super!Hermione is still friendless, craves companianship and support, displays a crippling need for approval and fails to step up. Boring again.

See how that's unfair to characters you're favouring?

A hypothetical story is only as interesting as you're willing to let it be.
