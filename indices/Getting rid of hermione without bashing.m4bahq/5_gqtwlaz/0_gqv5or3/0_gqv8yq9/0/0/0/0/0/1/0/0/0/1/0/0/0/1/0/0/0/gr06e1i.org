  (It's not particularly true except for the Patronus Charm, either, but that's a separate discussion.)

It is true, as I have already proven. But go on, ignore them. The last thing I'm gonna do is type it out all over again, only to be accused of repeating the same stuff which you haven't even disproved.

  Harry is far from the only one to knock people back with the Impediment Jinx, the Disarming Charm, Protego, etc., you know. Just do some keyword searches through the books.
#+end_quote

I don't need to do keyword searches mate. Fanon hasn't replaced canon for me. Antonin Dolohov is the only wizard to knock out someone in canon with the Impediment Jinx, and Moody got up immediately too.

Harry took on Fenrir Greyback, Amycus Carrow and another unnamed Death Eater. Keep writing it off, it won't change canon.

  A related fun fact is that in the Department of Mysteries battle, the only one who was targeted with lethal and Dark magic was Hermione. The others---Harry and the pureblood children---were targeted with Stunners and hexes of the sort that can be healed quickly.

Completely untrue. Neville was hit by a Cruciatus Curse from Bellatrix. Dolohov tried to use the same curse that hit Hermione on Harry too, who shielded/deflected it. Hermione was targeted by a potentially lethal spell just once. Stop using fanon theories.

So basically, anything Harry can do is only through some convenient detail which canon did not even mention? Sure.

Personality affects spells, sure. It doesn't replace the need for skill and knowledge. /That/ is fanon. Can't change it.

Again and again you put down Harry's achievements while using non-canonical extrapolations to hype Hermione up. No she didn't learn the spells Harry did. I've literally proved it multiple times. Super!Hermione ain't canon mate, as much as you wish it was.

"Hermione is ahead of Harry in everything" - peak Hermione fanboy sentence. Dark magic, Defense, Charms (not O.W.L.S., practical use), understanding of wands, Occlumency, horcruxes, duelling... Harry's knowledge is ahead of Hermione's in all of these. Hermione is better in Hogwarts subjects like Transfiguration, Potions and so on, sure. I've already addressed this.

Casually learning? In her own words, she tried a "few" spells. She didn't master first year material before the year began. It proves absolutely nothing, given that future Hermione /had to be taught by Harry/, and still got a lower result on her O.W.L. than him in DADA.

There is no speculation or proof that Hermione invented the Four Point Spell. Its origins are unknown. More fanon nonsense.

And to claim Hermione and Ron actually learnt the spells Harry did goes against canon, but you've been doing it a lot eh?

The DA had the chance to practice the Patronus. A handful of them were successful (in the books). And none showed any ability of being as good at it as Harry was.

The Parchment Jinx - Impressive, sure. Half as good as the Patronus? Not even close. A Patronus that can drive away a hundred Dementors? Forget it.

I've exaggerated Harry's feats? I'm the only one referring to canon in every other sentence here. And unlike you, I haven't used "examples" from fanfiction either. I'm yet to see a single "refutal" that I haven't debunked.

Here's the difference - I'm taking a charitable or /atleast/ neutral stance towards all the characters, while you're viewing a choice few characters (first and foremost being Hermione) in the most favourable light and attempting to show Harry in negative light, often using fanon "facts" in your insistence to do so.

If you're far too enamoured with Hermione and dislike Harry, that isn't on me. The fact that your post history is basically "Smart/Indy Harry fics bad hurr durr" while hailing Indy!Hermione fics as the pinnacle of fanfiction (which are basically just Indy!Harry fics with Hermione in his place) is just more proof of this.

It's not my job to address your apparent, irrational hate of Harry. That's on you. Not me, not the books, and not on derivative fanfiction either.

Call it cop-out, if you want. You're not particularly above using them yourself. You've basically repeated yourself - multiple times - while dismissing all counterpoints without disproving them.

In my opinion, of course. Make of that what you will.
