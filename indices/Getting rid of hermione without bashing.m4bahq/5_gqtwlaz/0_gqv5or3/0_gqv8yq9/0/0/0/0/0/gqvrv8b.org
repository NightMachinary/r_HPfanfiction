Wot mate... I wasn't talking about the Duelling Club scene to say Harry and Ron would try to engage in a physical brawl and win. Rather, it shows that Hermione has a much harder time subduing a target who doesn't just stand around and wait to be attacked (y'know, like Neville did).

Aah, yes. Harry's contribution to the confrontation... Desperately looking to Hermione for help. Yet, in second year, where Lockhart didn't teach them shit, Harry knew enough jinxes and spells to hold off Malfoy. It's almost like Rowling doesn't allow Harry to shine whenever Hermione's around, eh?

Harry and Ron would not be helpless without Hermione. They were not completely useless in their classes without her in first year or after her petrification in second year. Harry even mentions that they mastered the basics and began spell-casting. Hermione does not hold their hand and teach them stuff. She only motivates, sometimes even nags, them to study harder.

Who knows? Without her, their brash tendencies might lead them into more confrontations with Malfoy, thus forcing them to learn more hexes to fight back.

The assumption that /Neville/ would become more competent simply due to Hermione's presence while Harry and Ron flounder and become useless screams of bias.

As for the weak jinxes part... They're first years. All they know are weak jinxes. Even Hermione.

In canon, it took the Trio a few minutes to reach the Third Floor corridor. Fluffy was already asleep when they reached there. He stirred a bit and immediately went back to sleep when Harry played the flute for a few seconds. How long do you think this takes?

The lesser help part doesn't matter... Again, Hermione didn't hold their hand or teach them. Their skill was all their own, with Hermione's presence only contributing to longer hours spent studying. Something they can do on their own in the correct setting.

TL;DR Harry and Ron can become quite competent, perhaps even more than their canon selves, without Hermione. They can even get through Hermione and all the traps quite easily if the author focuses on them, instead of turning all their fanboy energy into hyping Hermione (and /Neville/, of all people) up.
