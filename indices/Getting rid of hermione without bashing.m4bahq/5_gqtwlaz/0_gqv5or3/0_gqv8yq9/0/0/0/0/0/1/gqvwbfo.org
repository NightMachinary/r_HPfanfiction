When you have first- and second-years and starting in a very close proximity, brawling can be a viable tactic. (If I had a dollar for every Dramione fic in which he disarms her by the expedient of grabbing her arm...) However, if it does become a brawl, Hermione and Neville win by timeout. That's why it's worth mentioning.

The incident with Millie doesn't demonstrate your point, either, since they were specifically told to practice casting a Disarming Charm on each other---a Charm which has little stopping power unless there is a lot of anger involved. For all we know, Hermione might nave nailed Millie with it twice before Millie got her hands on her.

There are many authorial decisions made by JKR that I dislike but accept. You don't have to like that Harry either couldn't or didn't know what to do in that confrontation either. And, accusing an author of being "biased" for or against someone in their own work is a category mistake. It's not even wrong, and says more about /your/ biases than about the author's

A perfectly charitable explanation for Harry's inaction is that Ricumstempra and other jinxes he knew wouldn't have solved the problem of taking Neville down quickly and quietly, and he hoped that Hermione knew something that would. (She did.) Alternatively, the incident showed him that he had a deficiency in his skills, which he remedied off-screen during the first few months of his second year at Hogwarts.

I wouldn't say that Harry and Ron would be helpless without Hermione; and certainly a fanfic author can set up a sequence of events that would make them more motivated, but that's a preference, not an extrapolation of the most probable outcome. As it is, we see many, many instances with Hermione helping Harry and Ron learn magic---and only one (Patronus in the OotP) of the reverse. Again, it's theoretically possible that her attitude had turned them off studying, but, again, it's a preference, not a most likely outcome.

We have no idea how long it took for the trio to reach the corridor or to put Fluffy back to rest. A sentence of text can represent half a second or half an hour; but Hogwarts is a big place.

Could Hermione get Neville up to scratch? Here, I admit that it's more of a preference than a probability. However, he doesn't actually have to be any good. He just has to present a credible threat from the point of view of Harry and Ron.

The bottom line is that /everything/ would have to go Harry and Ron's way for them to succeed. Only one thing of a long list needs to go wrong for them to fail. (It does become easier if you add another person to their team, since they now have someone disposable.)
