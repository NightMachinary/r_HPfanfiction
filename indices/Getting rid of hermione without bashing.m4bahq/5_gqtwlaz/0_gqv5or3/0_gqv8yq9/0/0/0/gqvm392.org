  I'm pretty sure the scuffle with Mille was something that Hermione did on purpose, in order to get a hair sample from her.

That's fanon. Probably from Forging the Sword. There's no indication that Hermione "lost" on purpose.

Harry and Ron only have to beat Hermione and Neville quickly, which they can. Once they're outside the portrait with a headstart and an Invisibilty Cloak, there's very little Hermione can do. Even if she attempts to follow them or inform the Prefects/McGonagall, Harry and Ron won't take long to cross Fluffy.

And that's assuming they don't use the Body-Bind Curse themselves. It's not exactly hard.

Oh, and Neville doesn't really contribute anything to the confrontation. It's basically 2 on 1 in Team Harry's favour, and Harry himself could end the fight quite quickly.

About the Quidditch victory... Ok? Harry won them the match. The points are still counted as being won by him. Also, winning 2 Quidditch matches (1 quite quickly, to avoid Snape's supposed favouritism) makes Harry responsible for 300 points. Without Hermione being involved in the dragon-smuggling, they lose only 100.

And sure, Hermione can be motivated and angry to try and stop them. Doesn't mean she would be successful.
