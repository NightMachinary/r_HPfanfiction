Reducing Harry's duelling ability to his physicality and athleticism massively demeans his magical prowess.

We have a very different understanding of what magical competency is, apparently. The rate at which Harry learns spells doesn't really matter. The fact that once mastered, his spells have much greater effects (beyond what the standard level is) shows that he is indeed far ahead of his classmates.

This is not just for spells that depend on his emotional disposition. He uses the Impediment Jinx to violently banish and knock out a Death Eater in HBP, and the idea that his state of anger "powers" the spell is pure fanon.

Similarly, the idea that Dark Magic is easier to learn/cast if you're an immoral person is fanon. As far as canon is concerned, it is up to the skill of the witch or wizard. The fact that Harry pulled of spells like Sectumsempra just by reading the incantation, as well as spells like the Cruciatus and Imperius in his second and first try respectively shows that his apparent inability to learn magic faster is his failure as a student, not as a wizard.

I have never denied that there are a few aspects in which Hermione is ahead of Harry. Indeed, her ability to understand and apply theory /explained to her/ by someone quickly is much greater than Harry's. This makes her a better student, not a better witch/wizard.

Ron said that they would be better prepared for the O.W.L.S. Is this a generic sentence a kid would say when he's just looked up a lot of interesting stuff or is this a genuine analysis of his own skills? As Ron and Hermione have to actually learn and practice the spells in OotP, I'd say the former is a more canon-faithful interpretation.

Ron and Hermione's presence is clearly moral support, not educational. This is made apparent repetitively in canon. They learnt a lot of stuff themselves, sure. They didn't teach Harry, which should be obvious (as they weren't experts either).

Harry is a superior wizard due to his ability to get extraordinary results. Hermione is a better student due to her ability to learn faster. And Harry is a better duelist because of his magical /and/ physical prowess. Not just one of them.

Insisting on viewing Harry's duelling ability as a result of only his athleticism, while saying Hermione is a better witch /and/ student due to her ability to learn faster reveals an inherent bias against him. One which I do not share.

As for the whole inconsistencies thing, using a character's lowest showing to judge their ability is just unfair. If we "cherry-pick" the lowest of Harry's displays, then the same uncharitable treatment must be extended towards /all/ other characters. But that isn't an accurate way of gauging their estimated ability.
