OK, fair enough. Let's say that Hermione hadn't planned it. They are still 11 and 12 years old, and Millie was bigger than Harry at the Duelling club. If it gets down to a physical brawl, it won't be fast, there will be noise, and even if they win, there will be time wasted tying people up.

As for their ability to win this fight, I don't want to put down Harry, but in canon, the following was his contribution when confronting Neville, who was standing in their way, his fists raised:

  Harry turned to Hermione.

  â€˜Do something,' he said desperately.

Without Hermione? Harry and Ron would be /worse/ at magic, because they would need to study more to get the same result. Neville on the other hand, might actually be better at magic, since it's not like Hermione has anyone else to try to tutor, and Neville would put up with her because he is pliable enough. But even if not, he can still contribute, because when all Harry and Ron know are weak jinxes, punching and grabbing is actually an option, and Neville strikes me as the particularly tenacious type.

But, suppose that against all prior indications, Harry and Ron will have somehow picked up enough magic to take down both Neville and Hermione, quickly and quietly.

Then, they are travelling to a known destination. How fast do you think they would be able to run under a cloak? Not faster than someone who is not thus encumbered.

OK, suppose they've gotten there first by some miracle. There's Fluffy. They start playing the music. It's not an immediate effect, and easily interrupted. Then, they need to actually get through the trapdoor without waking fluffy. Mission accomplished!

To recap, to avoid being stopped, they have to pick up magic skills they didn't have in canon, with less help than they had in canon; win the fight overwhelmingly---quickly, quietly, without losses; then either somehow bind and silence two peiple or outrun older and faster people who know the castle better, while under an invisibility cloak; and they need to do it with enough of a lead to play the flute long enough to put Fluffy to sleep, tiptoe to the trapdoor, open it, and jump down. If any one of these things goes wrong, they "lose".

At which point, they better hope they know a fire spell, because otherwise, they are going to /wish/ they'd been hit by that Full-Body Bind.

So, I don't like their odds.
