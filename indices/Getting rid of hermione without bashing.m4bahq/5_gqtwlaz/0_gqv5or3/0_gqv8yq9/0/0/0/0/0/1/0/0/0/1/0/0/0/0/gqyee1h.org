  Those are specific examples. I could point out that Harry learnt complex, powerful spells in GoF from a textbook (while Ron helped him in target practise and Hermione simply reminded him of the textbook theory word-to-word if necessary). Compare this to the DA, who had to /learn/ this stuff from him, and I'd say he's far ahead of them.

I have no dog in this fight, but I'd like to point out that the magic Harry learned in GoF wasn't very complex or powerful. The only spells we know he learned were the Impediment Jinx (which, IIRC, Ron and Hermione could also cast in GoF), the Point Me Charm, the Reductor Curse, and the Shield Charm. The only one of those spells that could be called advanced is the Shield Charm (since it was on the fifth year curriculum), and Harry didn't even manage to cast it properly until OotP. For the majority of spells he taught the DA, he learned them a few days before their meetings.

Also, using the Battle of the Astronomy Tower as evidence for him being an exceptional duelist is odd since, IIRC, he mostly just one-shotted people who were already duelling other people. Any relatively agile and courageous upper year could have done the same.
