Sure.

If a bit of canon is clearly inconsistent with all past and future examples, with the only difference being the absence of a specific character who holds a special significance for the author, "biased" is a perfectly reasonable argument.

The /one/ contest? Those are specific examples. I could point out that Harry learnt complex, powerful spells in GoF from a textbook (while Ron helped him in target practise and Hermione simply reminded him of the textbook theory word-to-word if necessary). Compare this to the DA, who had to /learn/ this stuff from him, and I'd say he's far ahead of them.

Even in HBP, Harry pretty much turns the tide of the final fight after the DA struggled around for whatever unspecified period of time. He immediately jinxed multiple opponents with a high (nearly perfect) success rate. Plus, Ron, Hermione and Ginny had Felix Felicis while he didn't and the other DA members like Anthony Goldstein and Ernie Macmillan are quite far from the main "action".

OP!Harry who kicks Voldemort's ass in straight fight is fanon, Harry being much better than his classmates isn't.

Also, accusing me of using cop-outs while dropping the mother of all ad homs is just not done man.
