Mate, you keep describing bits of canon as biased as if that makes them less canon, as if there exists some ideal canon-as-it-should-have-been that lacks these alleged biases.

  The fact that Harry's greatest tools in his fight against Voldemort are friendship and love doesn't change the fact that he's miles ahead of literally everyone in his year, even Hermione.

If you actually believe this, then I think that our understandings of what is "canon" are far too different for us to have a sensible discussion. I can see it as your canon-as-it-should-have-been, and, like I wrote earlier, I think I get where it's coming from. (I didn't just come up with this to diss you: I was writing about it years ago ([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/seventh-horcrux-hp-au.298748/post-15004312]], [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/seventh-horcrux-hp-au.298748/post-15005730]]).

Anyway, yes, I vastly prefer the ironic and whimsical conclusion to the whole misadventure to the yet another canon rehash but with more badass Harry (and maybe Ron too, this time---good for him). So sue me.
