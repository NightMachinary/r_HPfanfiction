Don't get me wrong---Harry can be /very/ fun to read. One of my favourite one-shots of all time is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118202/1/In-Which-Sirius-Can-t-Tell-a-Story-to-Save-His-Life]]), for example, which does an amazing job of capturing Harry's smart mouth. And yet, it seems that the more highly an author thinks of Harry, the more eager they seem to be to replace Harry with an OC with the same name (adjusted for gender) and similar background.

The fics that actually manage to use Harry well without erasing nearly everything that makes him him tend to have ensemble casts, with linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739/1/Weasley-Girl]]) being the best example off the top of my head. I don't think that's a coincidence. Harry works best with his friends, and peeling him away from them diminishes him---and to a large extent, so does reducing them to "moral support".

Stepping back to a more overarching plot---and here's what I mean by "uninteresting"---consider a thought experiment: keep Harry's basic personality, values, interests, and decision making ability as they were at the start of Hogwarts, but make him a magical genius on the level of Dumbledore and Riddle. How would it change what he chooses to do? I am not asking how it would change the canon storyline---those are almost always things that happen /to/ Harry, and being a genius would liberate him from many of those constraints. He gets to do with his life basically anything he wants.

My read on his character is that, if he has to do less work to get the same results, and if his confrontations are resolved easily, he will spend more time hanging out with his friends and playing games---and being happier. Good for him, sure, but you'd need to throw genius-sized challenges at him to him to do anything interesting.

Now, do that with Ron. Ron isn't that different (which is a big part of why they clicked), but an important aspect of his character is his insecurity about his overachieving brothers. Now, if he's the next Dumbledore, how would he act on that insecurity? Probably in ways that create interesting conflicts.

It's similar with Hermione, but even more so. She'd be actually following in Dumbledore's footsteps, working to Fix the World (whether the world wants it or not). She'd be stepping on people's toes---with the weight of an elephant. That's the sort of thing interesting conflict is made of.

I am genuinely interested in what your read on this scenario is.
