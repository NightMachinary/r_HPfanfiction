  I don't need to do keyword searches mate. Fanon hasn't replaced canon for me. Antonin Dolohov is the only wizard to knock out someone in canon with the Impediment Jinx, and Moody got up immediately too.
#+end_quote

Fine, let me do it for you, from OotP:

#+begin_quote
  Harry was not aware of releasing George, all he knew was that a second later both of them were sprinting towards Malfoy. He had completely forgotten that all the teachers were watching: all he wanted to do was cause Malfoy as much pain as possible; with no time to draw out his wand, he merely drew back the fist clutching the Snitch and sank it as hard as he could into Malfoy's stomach --

  ‘Harry! HARRY! GEORGE! NO!'

  He could hear girls' voices screaming, Malfoy yelling, George swearing, a whistle blowing and the bellowing of the crowd around him, but he did not care. Not until somebody in the vicinity yelled ‘Impedimenta!' and he was knocked over backwards by the force of the spell, did he abandon the attempt to punch every inch of Malfoy he could reach.

  ‘What do you think you're doing?' screamed Madam Hooch, as Harry leapt to his feet. It seemed to have been her who had hit him with the Impediment Jinx; she was holding her whistle in one hand and a wand in the other; her broom lay abandoned several feet away. Malfoy was curled up on the ground, whimpering and moaning, his nose bloody; George was sporting a swollen lip; Fred was still being forcibly restrained by the three Chasers, and Crabbe was cackling in the background. ‘I've never seen behaviour like it -- back up to the castle, both of you, and straight to your Head of House's office! Go! Now!'
#+end_quote

That was the first one I found.

#+begin_quote
  Harry took on Fenrir Greyback, Amycus Carrow and another unnamed Death Eater. Keep writing it off, it won't change canon.
#+end_quote

He didn't take them on. He ambushed two of them while they were fighting someone else, and Fenrir attacked him without a wand. Just reread the darned scene; it's not that long.

#+begin_quote
  Completely untrue. Neville was hit by a Cruciatus Curse from Bellatrix. Dolohov tried to use the same curse that hit Hermione on Harry too, who shielded/deflected it. Hermione was targeted by a potentially lethal spell just once. Stop using fanon theories.
#+end_quote

Sorry, I was in a hurry and hadn't mentioned that, because for all its unforgiveablness, Cruciatus is the one curse that isn't actually damaging without prolonged exposure, so it was immaterial.

You're right about Dolohov trying to curse Harry with that spell later, too---it was after the grown-ups had shown up, and I didn't remember that part as well. It's actually a pretty odd combination of things: Dolohov hit Neville with a /Dancing Feet Spell/, then tried to curse Harry with a similar curse to the one he had cast at Hermione, even though they were under standing orders not to kill Harry.

In any case, you are right, and I withdraw my claim. I think there is evidence that at least pureblood kids were treated with kid gloves (like the above-mentioned dancing feet spell for Neville). With respect to Harry, my updated canon is now that Dolohov's original threat was a bluff, then after Harry Petrified him, he got mad and forgot himself. (Unless, is there a good reason Voldemort would have standing orders to leave Harry for him in late HBP but not in late OotP?)

Now, please do me a favour and reread the HBP scene. It's not nearly as glorious as you make it out to be.

#+begin_quote
  Personality affects spells, sure. It doesn't replace the need for skill and knowledge. That is fanon. Can't change it.
#+end_quote

Never said it did. But it's one of several factors, one that you seem to be inclined to neglect.

#+begin_quote
  Again and again you put down Harry's achievements while using non-canonical extrapolations to hype Hermione up. No she didn't learn the spells Harry did. I've literally proved it multiple times. Super!Hermione ain't canon mate, as much as you wish it was.
#+end_quote

Mate, I already wrote that there are, possibly, non-Patronus spells that Harry learned before Hermione, because, like I said, Hermione and Ron were helping Harry practice, because Harry had the TWT, and they didn't. Heck, he might have even helped her master some of them---get them to the point of usefulness.

#+begin_quote
  "Hermione is ahead of Harry in everything" - peak Hermione fanboy sentence. Dark magic, Defense, Charms (not O.W.L.S., practical use), understanding of wands, Occlumency, horcruxes, duelling... Harry's knowledge is ahead of Hermione's in all of these. Hermione is better in Hogwarts subjects like Transfiguration, Potions and so on, sure. I've already addressed this.
#+end_quote

Let's see... Dark Magic---maybe; I don't know if the Parchment Jinx counts, and I don't know whether this is a competition one actually wants to win. Defense and duelling, I am happy to agree, with the provisos mentioned. Charms, other than Patronus, needs a bit of an elaboration, since Hermione casually pulls off stuff like the Protean Charm on a large scale and the Undetectable Extension Charm. Wandlore is generally unimportant outside of the very specific circumstances Harry and only Harry was dealing with. Occlumency Harry never got anywhere with, and his substitute would only work against Voldemort because he was allergic to Harry's mind, and not anyone else; and it's not like anyone offered Hermione lessons. Horcruxes? By the end of DH, Hermione actually knows how to make one. (Though, again, I am not sure that's a competition one wants to win.) :P

And, well, /most/ magic is Hogwarts subjects. Most of what you list is stuff idiosyncratic to Harry's specific adventures.

#+begin_quote
  Casually learning? In her own words, she tried a "few" spells. She didn't master first year material before the year began. It proves absolutely nothing, given that future Hermione had to be taught by Harry, and still got a lower result on her O.W.L. than him in DADA.
#+end_quote

I didn't say she mastered things. You keep putting words in my mouth like this; please don't. The point was she tried them, and they worked; I only brought it up because you made various claims that she does well mainly when it's explained to her.

The DADA OWL is not surprising: it doesn't matter how good your /Ridikkulus/ is, if you are paralysed with fear by the Boggart. Also, it's not clear whether anyone other than Harry got an opportunity for bonus marks for casting a Patronus---the dialogue suggests that it was special treatment, but it's open to interpretation.

The Four Point Spell possibility is mentioned in the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Four-Point_Spell][wiki]]. Like I said, it's speculation, and I put a low probability on it myself.

And nobody disputes Harry's enormous Patronus. We've all seen it.

  If you're far too enamoured with Hermione and dislike Harry, that isn't on me. The fact that your post history is basically "Smart/Indy Harry fics bad hurr durr" while hailing Indy!Hermione fics as the pinnacle of fanfiction (which are basically just Indy!Harry fics with Hermione in his place) is just more proof of this.
#+end_quote

My favourite fics are actually ensemble casts that include Harry as a co-equal member, followed by Hermione-centric non-romance (all dozen of them), followed by Ron-centric fics. My favorite pairings---to the extend I have them---are the canon ones, though perhaps one day I may find a Krumione fic where their personalities hadn't been excised.

My supposed hatred of Harry? Let me explain. The problem with Harry as a fanfic character is that outside of the whole Prophecy-BWL-Voldemort thing, he's just uninteresting; and it doesn't help that Ron and Hermione have much better defined personalities and ambitions, and more interesting flaws. And the best evidence for this is that even Smart/Indy!Harry writers seem to agree with me, if we judge their deeds rather than their words: overwhelmingly, the first thing they do in their fics is rewrite Harry's personality, insecurities, interests, strengths, weakness, goals, and even values to the point where he might as well be named "Bob". Just look at the most popular and respected fics in those genres. And, over the process, they often drop the very things that made Harry's point of view in canon compelling.

If you're going to dig through my posting history, look at the fics I recommend and the fics I criticise. Or, just ask me what fics I would recommend without reservation.
