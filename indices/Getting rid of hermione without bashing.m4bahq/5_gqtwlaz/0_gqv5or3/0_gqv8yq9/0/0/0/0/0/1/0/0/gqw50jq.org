Mate, I don't think there is anything in your post that I haven't either addressed already---sometimes several times---or that is trying to respond to an argument I didn't make.

For example, you insist that I "guarantee" that Hermione and/or Neville win a brawl against Harry and/or Ron. I've written, /several times/, that they don't need to /win/ anything. They just need to delay and make noise. What they need to do is /not lose/ long enough, which is a much easier task.

Similarly, when you say that there is nothing indicating that had Hermione hit Millicent with a Disarming Charm, that misses the point, which is that whether or not Hermione hit, it wouldn't stop Millicent from grappling her, which means that Millicent grappling her is not evidence for or against either possibility.

And now, you bring out the Self-Insert thing. Here's what Rowling actually said in [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-connectiontransc2.htm#p3][an interview]]:

  Hermione is a caricature of what I was when I was 11 - a real exaggeration, I wasn't that clever - Hermione is a border-line genius at points - and I hope I wasn't that annoying, because I would have deserved strangling; sometimes she is an incredible know-it-all.

Does that sound like a self-insert to you?

Mate, you seem to have a vision of how talented, motivated, etc. Harry /should/ have been. And I get it. Harry was a male protagonist of a heroic fantasy. The typical journey for such a hero is, in fact, to gather power, either in his own abilities or in his allies, and then overcome the villain with force and cunning. But that's not what happened in the books. The cunning was largely other people's domain: the old mentor, the spy, the female sidekick; and the "force" was power of love and willingness to sacrifice self, with the final victory achieved not by complex or advanced magic but with the most peaceful of spells learned early in his schooling. It is natural to wish for Harry to be more conventionally badass. It's not even necessarily a gender thing: there are lots of popular fem!Harry fics out there.

As for my preferences, I think that it's a /fun/ possibility that Hermione is there along with Neville because it ties things back together nicely. That they then either delay or cripple the expedition is the best prediction based on available evidence, however.

I don't know where you're getting what Hermione did or didn't master and when. Harry doesn't exactly keep track of the spells she knows. With respect to Neville, he had the courage to confront the three strongest students in his house and year at the end of PS without much intervention; then IIRC not much happened for 3 years; then he got better in DA in OotP. So, yes, it could happen in a year of concerted effort. In any case, given the level Harry and Ron are at at that point, just grappling is already effective.

About the scene in canon, we don't actually know how much time elapsed before leaving the common room and coming to the "first set of stairs". If you look at the conversation text, Neville is the only one who raises his voice, the loudest sound was when Hermione "cried" the spell incantation.

Was Hermione coddled by canon? Off the top of my head, she was almost killed by a troll, Potioned, petrified, ostracised, cursed with a Dark curse, and tortured, all without getting to be the protagonist. (Ron had his share of injuries, at least one Hermione-inflicted, but I think Hermione did worse overall in terms of stuff that can't be healed by Pomfrey in a few minutes.)

My bottom line is that the fic author could write anything they wanted, but /if/ you take the most reasonable extrapolation of canon for characters' capabilities /and/ stipulate that Hermione joins Neville in confronting Harry and Ron /then/ Harry and Ron will probably not be able to continue for any one of the reasons I have listed.
