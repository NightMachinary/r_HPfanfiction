Correction: I didn't refer to them as biased as if that makes them less than canon. I named them as such because they do not paint an accurate picture of Harry's canon-level skill.

Again, I didn't say Harry is as powerful as Dumbledore or Voldemort, which he most certainly isn't. But saying he's way ahead of his peers is just canon. No one in Harry's year repelled a hundred dementors, nor could they resist Crouch Jr.'s Imperius, much less Voldemort's. If you think this still doesn't make Harry vastly better than his classmates, then yes, I agree. Our interpretations of canon are too different to have a discussion.
