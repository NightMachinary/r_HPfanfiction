And as I have already addressed, there's no "long enough". No one is going to rush down into the common room to stop Harry and support Hermione.

The only thing the fight vs Millicent is evidence of is that Hermione is not as good at duelling as you want her to be, which nicely ties back to the notion that Harry and Ron can get past her easily enough.

If Hermione is intended to be a caricature, she should have been called out on her flaws more often (or at all, really) and she should have suffered greater direct consequences for her BS. If Rowling tried to make her a caricature of an intelligent, yet arrogant eleven-year old, she failed.

Give me a break. I'm quoting stuff from canon yet I have a "male power fantasy vision" with respect to Harry? Are you sure it's not just your vision of super!Hermione suffering from canon analysis?

The fact that Harry's greatest tools in his fight against Voldemort are friendship and love doesn't change the fact that he's miles ahead of literally everyone in his year, even Hermione.

You think it's a fun possibilty that Hermione robs the third act of all action and tension, and instead gets Harry and Ron caught by McGonagall and/or the Prefects? Really? Ok bruh.

Hermione is clearly stated to learn stuff along with the rest of the DA. It's never mentioned or even implied that she teaches the DA. It's not canon that she already knows those spells in OotP.

"Just grappling" won't be effective when Neville gets hit in the face with a spell, and hence won't help Hermione and Neville hold off Harry and Ron. How hard can this be to understand? And don't give me that BS about Harry and Ron not knowing spells. They did in canon; Ron is clearly stated to know the Leg-Locker Jinx, and suggesting that he can't/won't learn it in an AU is just more Hermione favouritism.

I have already given enough proof that the time and any ruckus caused by Neville and Hermione is inconsequential. I'm not going to repeat it.

Let's see - Hermione figures out Slytherin's monster despite having only one clue more than the most intelligent wizard of all-time; when her cat attacks Ron's rat, it turns out that the rat was a villain all along and Hermione was right not defend it despite having no prior notion; an experienced journalist apparently has no safeguard against a teenage witch blackmailing her; when Hermione turns out to be completely wrong about Malfoy's Death Eater status, the book she's been complaining about all year conveniently turns out to be written by Dumbledore's murderer.

And not once, is she ever held responsible. Coddled? 100%.

The most reasonable extrapolation of Harry and Ron's skill level in an AU is not to nerf them. Their canon capability is far above that of an average witch or wizard, and showing the progression from the beginning is not an unlikely chain of events. What is an unlikely chain of events is Hermione suddenly having non-canonical support in stopping Harry and Ron, suddenly gaining the ability to take on two wizards of the same level as her and a new sidekick who goes from, as I have aready stated before, useless wizard to competent wrestler just because she motivated him.

If you want to continue sticking to possibilities where super!Hermione /always/ hands Harry and Ron the L, that's your personal, biased preference. Not the most probable outcome.

And the sheer irony of you stating I haven't said anything new while copy-pasting the same debunked theories is just ridiculous.

Edit: And clearly, this conversation isn't going anywhere. You can keep blaming OP!Harry fantasies or believing in Hermione's apparent superiority, it doesn't change canon. +Feel free to have the last word.+
