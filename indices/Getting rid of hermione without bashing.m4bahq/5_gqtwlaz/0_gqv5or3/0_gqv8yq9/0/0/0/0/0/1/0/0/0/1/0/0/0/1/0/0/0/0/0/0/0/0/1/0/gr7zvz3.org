I'll try to be brief. I think you've mostly made my case for me: Harry is a generic hero archetype, if a particularly reactive one. He says that he wants to destroy Voldemort and DEs---because they've hurt him and people around him (as I believe he says in that very same conversation, or maybe a nearby one). He becomes a wizard detective pretty much out of familiarity with the job, and it happens to be a job where he sits and waits for someone to commit a crime.

My thought experiment was not about what kind of a fanfic one could write but rather about trying to understand what drives the character. Also, I specifically gave them "genius", as opposed to things like drive, studiousness, and other things that are a part of personality, interests, and values, all of which are staying fixed at least at the start. Most of your predictions modify the latter or if not, and Harry plays a bigger role in the struggle because of greater talent alone, that's still in response to Voldemort. The idea is not particularly new---in the immortal words of Robert G. Ingersoll "If you want to find out what a man is to the bottom, give him power."

Given all you just wrote about Harry, can you really blame me for thinking that he's uninteresting outside of an [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTailoredToTheParty?from=Main.EigenPlot][eigen plot]]?

And, of course Harry (or any other character) would behave differently---and develop differently---in response to a different set of circumstances. But, how many fics bother to even begin to sketch out that evolution, rather than just going full HINO? One of the many reasons OtWtG is so great (and so tragically abandoned) is how diligently the author charts his path. (I've recommended OtWtG quite often, you'll find, and I've written my share of criticism about Hermione-in-name-only.)

I take your point about having a HINO evolve /into/ a hero, and it's a framework I haven't considered before and will take on board. Thank you for introducing me to it. The problem I see with it in this situation is that it apples equally to pretty much any character: from Abbott to Zabini, or an actual OC.
