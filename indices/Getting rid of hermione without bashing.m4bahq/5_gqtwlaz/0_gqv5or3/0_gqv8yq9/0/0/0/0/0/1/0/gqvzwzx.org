There's no guarantee of Hermione and Neville winning in a brawl. There's nothing in canon which suggests that other students will interfere due to any disturbance. Heck, it's unlikely Harry and Ron will even bother with physical fights, and neither Hermione nor Neville show the kind of traits which makes you think they would throw out punches.

Similarly, there's nothing in canon which suggests Hermione hit Millicent with a Disarming Charm. If you're determined to view all of Hermione's actions in the most favourable light, sure, go on. Doesn't make it canon.

Given that 1) Hermione is Rowling's Self-Insert and 2) this is the first in a long list of inconsistencies where Harry doesn't do something in Hermione's presence despite clearly having the ability to, I'd say author's bias can be blamed here.

Yes, Harry and Ron becoming more proficient at magic is a preference, just as how Hermione even being in the common room or being able to take on Harry and Ron long enough to delay them is /your/ preference. In canon, Neville and Ron practically had a shouting match before Hermione cursed him. There's no reason to assume the other students would wake up and interfere, yet that's the scenario you want.

Given that Harry and Ron go on to become quite capable wizards, I'd say my preferred version of events is simply an accelerated variant of the most probable result.

Also, Hermione never taught them spells. She told them off for being lazy, made homework plans, sure. But she didn't ever teach them.

And Harry taught her more than just the Patronus. Almost every spell that Harry taught the DA, Harry taught her too. Hermione didn't master the Stunning Spell, the Impediment Jinx, the Shield Charm, the Reductor Curse or a number of other spells in GoF, that was Harry.

We have a clear idea of how long it took to reach the Third Floor. They ran into Mrs. Norris at the bottom of the first flight of stairs, encountered Peeves less than a minute later and reached the corridor in a similar amount of time. Quite fast, in my opinion.

Neville going from useless coward to somewhat skilled wizard took 5 years in canon. If you think Hermione can make him a credible threat in less than a year...

"Everything would have to go the protagonist's way"... This is pretty much canon. Hermione herself benefited a lot from practically being coddled by canon. Why can't the same treatment be extended towards just Harry and Ron?

In any case, it isn't really a stretch to believe Harry and Ron can do the exact same stuff as canon without much trouble. Not as much as it is to think Hermione somehow stands a chance against both of them together. My previous TL;DR note pretty much sums it up.
