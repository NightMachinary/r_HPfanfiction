I'm pretty sure the scuffle with Mille was something that Hermione did on purpose, in order to get a hair sample from her. Even if not, it's comparing apples and oranges to coffee and tea.

Even if we grant that Harry could have beaten Hermione in a magical duel at the time, the point is that there would be a fight, in which the hypothetical Team Harry (including Ron and whomever else) have to succeed in every way to achieve their objective:

- subdue all opponents
- /and/ bind them securely
- /and/ do it quickly
- /and/ do it quietly
- /and/ suffer no important casualties in process.

On the other hand, the hypothetical Team Hermione (including Neville) only need to foil Team Harry in one way to prevent them from achieving their objective:

- not be subdued (i.e., outright win the fight)
- /or/ escape to raise alarm
- /or/ delay Team Harry enough
- /or/ create enough noise
- /or/ inflict at least one important casualty.

One of these teams has a much more difficult job than the other.

AFAIK, a Quiddich victory gets the house 150 points, period. The margin doesn't matter.

As for positions of authority, Hermione doesn't need one to be angry and motivated to stop Harry and Ron from pissing away any more house points, which is what matters.
