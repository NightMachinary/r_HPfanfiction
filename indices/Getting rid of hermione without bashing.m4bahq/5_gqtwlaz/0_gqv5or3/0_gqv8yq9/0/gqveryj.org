Would the Body-Bind really get them though? Hermione failed to jinx Millicent Bulstrode in CoS, who apparently held her in a headlock before Hermione could curse her. Given that Harry is just as competent as Malfoy in CoS, and held him off quite well for several minutes, I'd say a Harry vs. Hermione duel would be quite short at the end of PS, and quite certainly in Harry's favour.

The victory would belong to the team, yes. But the points gained from catching the Snitch belong solely to Harry. As for Quirrell's curse, there are many ways to ignore or resolve that situation without Hermione. Hermione herself disrupted Quirrell accidentally, her main target was Snape. Any character could be allowed to replace her.

And sure, the blame would solely be on Harry's head for the points lost during the dragon-smuggling, but he's not losing any points he hasn't himself directly contributed to. Also, Hermione isn't really in a position of authority to call them out for it.
