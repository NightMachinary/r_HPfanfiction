I think you're taking my casual musings a bit too seriously, but fine, I'll bite.

Why wouldn't they know the jinxes themselves? I didn't say that they wouldn't; but if the Body Bind hits you, you are out of the fight and silenced, whereas all those others let you keep going if you are determined enough. Either way, it doesn't matter who wins, just that there would be a fight. Once the spells start flying around and people start screaming spells or invective, it only takes a few people to overhear and but the kibosh on the whole thing. And even if Harry, Ron, etc. somehow win without alerting anyone, they still have to tie them up and gag them, etc..

About the Points, that line was obviously from Hermione's biased perspective. But, even your argument doesn't work, because 1) Harry's Quiddich victory doesn't belong to him, it belongs to the whole team, even if Harry made an outsized contribution; 2) without Hermione's intervention at the Quiddich match---and not being Harry's friend, she might not bother attending---Harry probably would not have caught the Snitch; and 2) even if we loosely follow canon, Harry and his friends had just wiped out at least one of his Quiddich victories through the ill-fated dragon smuggling---and they are refusing to tell anyone why.
