Make something slightly change that prevents the Troll scene from happening. This can range from someone telling a teacher that she's crying in the bathroom (I can see Ron doing something that irritates Lavender or Parvati and when they tattle, they mention "and oh! He's been so mean to Granger, she's been crying in the bathroom all day because of him!") so there's a teacher there talking her out when the troll shows up, to Lavender/Parvati sticking up for her as a kind of "girls against mean boys" thing so she doesn't end up crying in there all day, to swapping it so that some other students overheard Lavender talking about how she'd been crying all day so it turns into a different set of students rescuing her and she latches onto them instead - there are plenty of nice ways to move that scene around that will end with sidelined Hermione without bashing.

Another thing I've seen is having one of the teachers or older students talk to her earlier in the year about social skills and basically presenting it in a way that causes her to tone down her behavior enough that she actually makes friends. It's a bit difficult to do this right, but it definitely can work - get her into a club and have an older student who recognizes themselves as a first year take Hermione under their wing (Penelope Clearwater might be a good choice here), get a teacher to be slightly more aware of bullying and talk with her, there's loads of options.

Basically, give her other friends. The Troll incident + not having other friends is what tied her in with Harry and Ron, so if you can give her another set of friends then she's nicely in the background and having a perfectly nice time in school without being involved in Harry's adventures.
