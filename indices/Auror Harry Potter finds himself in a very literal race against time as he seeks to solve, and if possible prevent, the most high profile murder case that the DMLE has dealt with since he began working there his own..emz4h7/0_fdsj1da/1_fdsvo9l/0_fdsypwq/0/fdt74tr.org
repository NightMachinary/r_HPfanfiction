Process to avoid Death via Paradox:

1. Take “dead body” from Ministry; place in secure location only you know about.
2. Never look for it again.
3. Get a time turner
4. Get Draught if the Living Dead (dosage lasting a few hours)
5. Take it and quickly spin the time turner while standing in the atrium.
6. Wake up in your safe house.

Technically a paradox, but a survivable one.
