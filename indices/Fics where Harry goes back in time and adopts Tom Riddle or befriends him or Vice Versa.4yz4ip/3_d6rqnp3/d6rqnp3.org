Earlier in the year I read a fic that was at least 300k words long(could be wrong?) where Harry, when in limbo with Dumbledore, basically told him to go fuck himself, and he touched the representation of the horcrux that was once in his head. He goes back to Tom Riddle's time at Hogwarts and eventually befriends him. I didn't finish it but what I did read of it very well done.
