Harry adopts Tom:

linkao3(If Them's the Rules by MayMarlow) Probably eventual slash. I didn't read too far.

linkao3(The Abyss by AislingSiobhan) Warnings: Rape, imprisonment, child abuse, generally fucked up and unhealthy relationships galore. Slash. It's pretty well written though.

linkffn(Liberate Me by Tirith works) Harry/Grindelwald slash, but the author seemed to have gone on a hiatus before Grindelwald even made an appearance. Well-written but tragically unfinished.

There was also another one on AO3, a one-shot where Harry went back to kill Tom but ended up taking him instead. The one part I remember clearly was that Tom became attracted to Harry and basically drug-raped him after he graduated from Hogwarts, and then they separated for some time. Didn't save it because I felt the situation wasn't handled very well, though up to that point it was alright. Can't remember the name.

Harry befriends Tom Riddle (I'm assuming you're looking for simple friendship, so all romance fics are excluded):

linkffn(Welcome to Hogwarts 1949) WIP.

Tom befriends Harry in the present:

linkffn(Fate's Favourite by the Fictionist) This one is finished. In its prequel Past's Player Harry and Tom became sort of friends, but the writer put that one on hold before it could really happen, so all that's currently in PP is a sort of intense rivalry, thus why I didn't recommend this one in the previous category.

Tom adopts Harry in the present:

linkffn(The Counterfeit Cousin by Tsume Yuki) Unfinished. Haven't read it yet.
