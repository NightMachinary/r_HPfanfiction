  [HP/LV] Nietzsche was right: when fighting monsters, Harry should have been more careful not to become one himself. That didn't matter anymore. It was too late to save himself, yet he could still save the world from Voldemort. But who would save Voldemort from him?

  Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.

  In which Lucius Malfoy decides to off a political opponent with a little black book and Tom Riddle finds himself with a new body and a lot of catching up to do. Of course, the orphan beneath the stairs is just happy that a family member finally came to rescue him. A Tom adopts Harry, somewhat dark fic.

  Time-travel, sort of. DH AU. MoD!Harry. Slash. / Harry is (re)born in 1909. His goal: prevent the rise of Voldemort and save the world. As for Grindelwald? Well, the chap just happens to own something Harry really wants. It's a shame Dark Lords are such possessive bastards. ::ARTWORK link on profile::

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?
