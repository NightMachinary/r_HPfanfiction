Since Nyanmaru listed a bunch of great ones, my list is going to bit a bit short :D

*Like Father, Like Son* - linkffn(13216994; 10950591) - A fun story that has Harry being Cap's son (sperm donor). It's a re-imagining of the abandoned (but still worth a read) 'A Happy Accident'.

*Finding Home* - linkffn(8148717) - MoD!Harry with the Avengers. This is what got me interested in these crossovers... and also got me to sit down and watch the damn MCU movies.

A note about /Say a Prayer/ - this isn't really a crossover and if you don't like bashing (of Ron, of Hermione, of Ginny, of... well it bashes like everyone) then skip it. The first part is a pretty ridiculous parody however, it does get more serious as it goes along.
