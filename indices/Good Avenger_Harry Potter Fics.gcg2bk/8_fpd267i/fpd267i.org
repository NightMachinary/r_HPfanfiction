- Draco is a Death Eater spy for the Order. Despite him being a spy, he is convicted for being a Death Eater and is sentenced to the Veil. When he passes through it, he lands in the MCU sometime around the first Avengers film. The fic is really good, and I apologize for the sparseness of my summary - I didn't do it justice, but it's a beautiful fic.

Another gorgeously written fic - it's after an alternate version of DH, wherein Harry's not quite alright after his Horcrux is destroyed. In this alternate timeline, he was friends with Loona and he applies a lot of Loona-isms in his speech and thought process. He also has some sort of amnesia. He befriends Banner a little after the events of the "Incredible Hulk" and the two share adventures trying to stay under the radar and traveling around the world. When Banner joins the Avengers, Harry follows suit. I'd like to emphasize that this is a very different Harry from canon, but nonetheless one that grows on you.
