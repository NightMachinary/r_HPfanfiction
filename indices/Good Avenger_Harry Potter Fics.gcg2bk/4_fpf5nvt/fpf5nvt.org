I have a couple of favorites, both WIP, which I don't see recommended very often. The Blood on My Hands. . . It Scares Me to Death has a wandless and emotionally scarred Harry land in the Avengers world. Beautifully written and sometimes brutal - one scene actually made me cry. There's just one chapter to go so I'm optimistic it will be completed. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11799474/chapters/26614947]]

Red Threads of Fate has a femHarry infiltrating the Avengers for a mission and has a great way of intersecting the HP and Avenger worlds. Also a soul mate fic which I don't generally like but I think they pull it off OK. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20298055/chapters/48118987]]
