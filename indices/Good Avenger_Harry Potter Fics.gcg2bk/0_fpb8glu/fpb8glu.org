*Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe* - linkffn(13326497)\\
AU - The war goes differently, everybody but Harry and Voldemort dies. After a final battle, Harry wins, and the ritual Voldemort was working on activates. He ends up in the MCU.

Harry ends up joining the Avengers, developing magical devices that improve humanity, politics, ands up upsetting the plot quite a bit.

*Heroes Assemble!* - linkffn(12307781)\\
Instead of the epilogue, Harry goes traveling after the final battle. After five years, he settles down in New York and opens a cafe. When the Battle for New York happened, he joined in and pisses off the ICW. He ends up joining the Avengers as an ICW sanctioned member.

*Say a Prayer* - linkao3(4629198)\\
AU - After a prayer to Loki, Loki adopts Harry. Upsets the plot completely. Adds a new bad guy that was working behind the scenes. What looks like bashing isn't really bashing. It's plot relevant and does get resolved. ANYWHO~ The Golden Trio breaks up, and Harry ends up spreading his wings socially. He makes new friends, creates a club. Sort of Muggle bashing?

Anyway, SHIELD is kind of an enemy in this one? Annoyance? SHIELD and HYDRA are in there, doing their own thing, while Harry and co do theirs. They intersect once in a while, and make for some good intrigue.

*On Punching Gods and Absentee Dads* - linkao3(17926664)\\
James was Loki. Harry is half Asgardian. After finding out, he starts planning: to punch his dad in the face. Warning: Loki's face gets punched a lot. And then plot ends up continuing. The Harry/Ron/Hermione friendship is really great in this one.

This fic is practically completed, all that is left is the epilogue.

*Holly Potter and the Midlife Crisis* - linkao3(17946929)\\
AU - FemHarry ends up as the Avengers' cleaning lady. Some good humor in this one. Holly goes about her job while keeping her magic a secret. Secret ends up getting out. Some action, some comedy, and some drama. Holly plays matchmaker with Hogwarts and Jarvis. WIP
