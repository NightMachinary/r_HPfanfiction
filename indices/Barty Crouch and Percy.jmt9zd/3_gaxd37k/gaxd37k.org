Family power and class mean a lot in the Wizarding World from what I can tell. Percy comes from a powerless and low class family. Arthur is just Dumbledore's pawn, and we see in fifth year that being on Dumbledore's side has little pull, his influence has waned significantly.

An ambitious person who has been disgraced will care little for his position, and more for influence peddling. Percy is a stick in the mud who focuses solely on doing his job perfectly, and has no influence. Like the annoying guy who wants to do things by the book, but has no mind for office politics. Aka ignorable.
