With Crouch's personality my idea of him is someone who was with Crouch from the start as he worked his way up, so has seen him in lower positions. Maybe a colleague at first who Crouch respected? Or at least respected enough to value him on his upward climb. As for what happened next who knows? We haven't seen them so maybe they were killed in the war? Took an AK for Crouch?

I'd love to see your take on Weatherby! We don't know anything and it's always neat how different people can take things like that in different directions. There's so many possibilities for it.
