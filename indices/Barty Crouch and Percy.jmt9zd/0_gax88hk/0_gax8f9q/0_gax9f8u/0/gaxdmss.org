Yeah, this is my take on it. Obviously he knows Arthur's last name, but he cares so little about Percy that he can't even be bothered to call him by his real name or possibly even to realize that he is Arthur's son. He is just merely a lowly assistant. It is like how at service related jobs, customers can be complete assholes and literally treat people like they are not even human because they matter so little. They are just nameless, faceless, and so unimportant that their entire meaning revolves around doing that they are told by others.
