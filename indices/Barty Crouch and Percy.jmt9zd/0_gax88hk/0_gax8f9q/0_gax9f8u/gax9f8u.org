Only real people. Percy is an assistant and unimportant. Or at least beneath Crouch's notice unless he needs things.

It sounds stupid but it's also the sort of thing a petty person would do when they've missed out on a lot of things are are stuck in a department they don't want to be in. He's gone from a potential minister to what was essentially a disgrace and he's ambitious enough that knowing he'll NEVER get that ultimate authority role would needle him and get worse over the years.

Ever had a boss that doesn't want to be there because they think they should be way higher up in the company? They do petty bitter things and get joy out of making someone else's day worse.
