Well. Does he?

That's kind of the question here, isn't it? Implied by 'Weatherby' is that does not, in fact, know Percy is Arthur's son -- because (as the satire in that case goes) Important Percy is too inconsequential to be of note to Crouch. He doesn't even spare the five seconds it takes to make the connection. Percy is Just That Irrelevant.

Alternatively, he can of course just call him Wetherby for shits and giggles. It's an effective enough way to clarify the power dynamics and who is the boss here.
