Pretty much everything by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/649528/nonjon][nonjon]] is awesome, particularly his [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter][Where in the World is Harry Potter]] trilogy.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

Sarah1281's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]] is also quite funny.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

If you want old-school, Ruskbyte's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1604214/1/Flying-Without-A-Broom][Flying Without a Broom]] is worth a read.

#+begin_quote
  Tonks is posing as a Hogwarts student when someone slips something into Harry's drink. With Death Eaters on the prowl and the Boy Who Lived not only missing, but stoned out of his mind and horny to boot, what's a girl to do?

Or, for a deconstruction of the Soul Bond trope, perhaps Perspicacity's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love][A Mother In Law's Love]]?

#+begin_quote
  Distraught over Ginny's death in the final battle, Harry gambles desperately and travels back in time to set things right. Unfortunately, not everything goes as planned. A twist on the classic Soul Bond tale.
