I'm trying this but... When I first started reading fanfics, all these ideas and AUs seemed interesting. Now, I get picky and drop fics immediately for handling characters/romance/cliched ideas(looking at you, Lord Hadrian Lestrange-Black-everylastname, with the authority to change everything even as a child, megapowerful!Harry, etc)/canon/pacing badly.

Back to OP, I give up after a year. As such, most stories I follow are deemed abandoned.
