Honestly, I very rarely start unfinished fics . After being burned too many times, and considering the fact there are so many completed fics, stopped many years ago.

However, occasionally there are fics which I come across that I take a risk on (or don't notice they're unfinished when I start them). And when I do, I don't give up hope so much as forget they exist. Unless its really amazing - there is one fic that was started almost 17 Years ago and hasn't been updated in a decade - I'm still holding out hope. It's not a Harry Potter fic though.
