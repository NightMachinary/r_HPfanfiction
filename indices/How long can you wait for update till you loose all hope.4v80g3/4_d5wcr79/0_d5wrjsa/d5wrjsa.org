As an author, I completely agree.

Life just gets in the way, and then there's writers block and all that... I still try to continue my unfinished story, but reading my own stories a year after I wrote it, I feel really ashamed at my writing style and my amateurish sentence structure and characterisation.

I actually deleted 2 stories of mine on WattPad that reached #1 on thriller and suspense a few years ago because of how ashamed I was of the writing style in that story...
