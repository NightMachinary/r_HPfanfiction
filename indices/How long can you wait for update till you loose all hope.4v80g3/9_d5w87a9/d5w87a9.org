How long did the previous update take? Have you tried reviewing a chapter to see if you get an answer from the author? If an author was previously putting chapters out regularly and then suddenly it's be a long time with no explanation, you're probably looking at an abandoned story.

However, there have been stories I thought abandoned that updated after a year or more of silence. Make sure you have an alert set up to notify you of an update but otherwise put it to the back of your mind and find something else to read.
