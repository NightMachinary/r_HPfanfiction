I actually never get back to a story after I finish the last chapter. If I start reading another story, then I'll forget about the previous one.

The only exception to this rule is linkffn(Balancing Destinies by DobbyElfLord). It's still the only story I've been waiting over two or three years for now. The prequel to this was just a really great story.
