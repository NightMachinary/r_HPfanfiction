Perfect response, yep :)

I don't really think he was going for the generally light feel of the HP books; you can definitely feel the AUness practically rolling off of it. The whole way he integrates magic into it sort of makes it into an original fic to be honest.

But the whole war and depiction of the country is quite simply put as /epic/. It'd probably be better to approach this intending to read a really good war story rather than a strictly HP fanfic.
