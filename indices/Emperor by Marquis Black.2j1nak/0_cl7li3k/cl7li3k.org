I'm in the middle of reading this at the moment and I'm really enjoying it. However, it doesn't really feel like a Harry Potter fanfiction. Harry conquering Europe while all the Ministry of Magic, Deatheaters and the OOTP are sidelined in Albion (so far) makes it so completely different from anything I've ever read in the fandom. /Rise of the Wizards/ is the closest, but /Emperor/ beats it hands down.

The author is really good at writing modern warfare scenes and explaining modern military strategy. He seems very knowledgeable and always seems to want to learn more to improve the story. I really like the /Band of Brothers/ feel I get from some of the scenes that feature minor characters in the war.

That said, this story is very long and very complicated. It's definitely not a light read, but if you think you would enjoy an epic war story featuring a muggle educated, very ambitious Harry Potter, then give it a shot.
