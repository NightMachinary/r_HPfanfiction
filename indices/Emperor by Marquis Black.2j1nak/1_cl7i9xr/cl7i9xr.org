/Summary:/

/Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU./

It's probably one of the best AUs I've ever read, and the author has a series - 'Dark Wars' - which follows a war-like line, too. I wanted to see if anyone else had read it because it begins to get very interesting once the civil war (and the following European war) starts!
