linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died) may meet your criteria. Lucius basically decalred himself Dark Lord when Voldemort disappeared and took over Britain. Harry went to Beauxbatons in France along with a large number of English exiles. Hermione was raised to hate the enemies of the Dark Lord as a jannissary.

Hermione Granger and the Boy who Lived is a very AU story where their is no magic, Harry's dad was 007, and instead of going to a school for magic, everyone learns how to be super spies with insane gadgets and mad science. Still kinda sorta follows the stations of the cannon, if you squint at it right.
