That doesn't mean they're not human and you strait up said that they may be genetically identical, that means they're the same, Humans and Chimps may be 99 percent the same but that is still a margin of 1 percent but that 1 percent is still a huge variable, a Human and A Wizard who are 100 percent compatible and 100 percent the same ARE THE SAME SPECIES Wizards could maybe be considered a sub-species but even then it doesn't matter because they are still the same thing as a Human and they still identify as Human and they are still genetically Human, their is no where in the canon that states that Humans and Wizards are a different species and yes this is fanfiction so YOU CAN do what you want with that and it might make an interesting plot point but since we're talking canon it makes no goddamn sense.
