Oh no see, I do listen, but the thing you don't seem to get is that your argument doesn't make any sense. If you were talking about an idea for some fanfic your writing then it'd be a different story but your talking about your head canon, I strait up challenged you to point out IN CANON OR ON POTTERMORE OR ON ANYTHING THAT OUR HOLY LADY OF SHITTY WORLD BUILDING JKROWLING HAS SAID that states that Wizards aren't human. When you said that they have the same genetic make up but they aren't human that's the same argument people used when talking about the other raises compared to Whites. I am willing to listen to argument and I love to debate but you need to come at me with facts instead of saying "well theirs something different about them, they can do the magic that means they aren't human" that doesn't make any sense, So from that perspective someone who can out compute a calculator isn't human since they have some strange ability?

The reason it works in X-men is because Mutants ARE a subspecies of Human, they have enough differences in their genetics that make them not human anymore, but a sub species. In Warhammer the Space Marines are arguably not human anymore for that exact same reason. In Percy Jackson Demi-Gods for all intents and purposes AREN'T human either for that same reason, they are half god half human, they have different genetics. Halflings in DND are the same way so are Veela in Harry Potter, they are different genetically, but similar enough to be able to mate with humans, the problem is Wizards AREN'T like that, they are just humans that have the ability to use magic. Star Wars is another example of this, is Luke Skywalker not human since he can tap into the force?
