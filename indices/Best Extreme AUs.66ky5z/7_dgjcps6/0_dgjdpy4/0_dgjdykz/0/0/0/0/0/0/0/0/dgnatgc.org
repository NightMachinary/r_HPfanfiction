In Star Wars those with a high enough midichlorian count can tap into the force, in Star Wars everyone has a midichlorian count. Not all humans can do Magic, it is something they must be born with - because their ancestors where capable of doing magic. There has to be, as I have said very many times already and is likely not furthering my argument, something /different/ with the wizards - or they would *not* be able to do magic; or all humans would have the potential to do magic. As you said earlier, they are most likely a subspecies of humanity. In [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Hybrid][Star Wars]] are not the other very alien humanoid species capable of mating with humans to produce offspring? In [[http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Hybrid][Star Trek]] are not the humanoid aliens capable of producing offspring with humans? Being able to have children with someone does not mean you are them, just that you are similar.

Pulling references from /other/ fandoms does not prove much here, I know, just that the concepts are similar. As you stated, humans can have children with Veale, but they can also mate with Giants - Hagrid and Madam Maxine - and Goblins - Professor Flitwick - so why would it be so hard to believe that humans can also mate with /wizards/.
