What? All muggles aren't Squibs - muggles are, err, muggles - they have no magic and they come from no magic. Muggleborns are the descendants of Squibs - people who had the potential to do magic but couldn't and passed that potential on to their offspring who in turn passed it on to theirs. Petunia, as Lily did, most likely - though not with any certainty - also had the potential for magic in her 'blood' and the ability to pass down that potential; so speaking somewhere down the line one of her descendants may be able to use magic. Since she has immediate family that knows magic, she should have been able to enter the magical community to a very limited degree - I was simply spinning a possible AU.
