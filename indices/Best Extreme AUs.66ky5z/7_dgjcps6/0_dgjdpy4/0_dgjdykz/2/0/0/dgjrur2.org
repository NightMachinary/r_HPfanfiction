I haven't read the books in a while but I am going to say no, mainly because I doubt Severus would have shown her parents magic since he was under age, and Lily and Snape can't really prove what they're saying is true to adults unless an adult is willing to show them and we both know that Snape didn't know any adults that would be willing (his mom wouldn't have gone against his dad and his father was an abusive ass from what I understand) So assuming this they'd wait until she got her letter to hogwarts.
