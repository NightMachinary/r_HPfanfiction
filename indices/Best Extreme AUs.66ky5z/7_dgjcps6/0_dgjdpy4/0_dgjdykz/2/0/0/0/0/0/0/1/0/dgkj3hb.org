  Firstly, you used the words logically and genetics, if we know one thing its that magic doesn't have to be logical nor does it have to follow scientific laws.

Exactly, That's what I said.

  Secondly, I remember vaguely in book 2? Maybe a later one something about a 'quickspells course' for squibs. I might be making it up but to me that implies they have potential but extremely limited.

If it's the case, you're certainly right. I can't confirm though. Would anyone know about that?

  Filch works at Hogwarts too, Hogwarts is meant to appear as rumble to muggles.

Yes, but does it appear this way to the people who are non-magical, or to the people who have the status 'muggle'. Magic in HP works through intent and thus, through language.

Muggle is a social category as well as a 'magical' reality (I was gonna write biological...).

It is also quite possible that you can put exceptions to a muggle repellant charm. It could even be a clause in Filch's contract.

Edit: As noted in another comment (confirmed by the wiki), squibs are indeed different from muggles and do have a few perks of their own. I really don't remember anything of the sort from the books though.
