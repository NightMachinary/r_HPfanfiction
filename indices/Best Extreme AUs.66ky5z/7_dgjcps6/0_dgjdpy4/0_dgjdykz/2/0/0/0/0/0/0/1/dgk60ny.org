Firstly, you used the words logically and genetics, if we know one thing its that magic doesn't have to be logical nor does it have to follow scientific laws.

Secondly, I remember vaguely in book 2? Maybe a later one something about a 'quickspells course' for squibs. I might be making it up but to me that implies they have potential but extremely limited. Not enough to make it worth teaching them anything but still a hint of magic. Filch works at Hogwarts too, Hogwarts is meant to appear as rumble to muggles.
