I'm pretty sure that squibs are just muggles that happen to be born from wizzards.

There's no reason magic should work logically, or follow the rules of genetics. For an unknown reason some are born wizards from muggle parents and other are born muggles from wizard parents.

There's no evidence whatsoever that squibs are anything but muggles. It could very well just be a status (as are half-blood, blood traitors and pureblood). I'm almost certain the idea that squibs' magic is dormant is purely fanon.

Although I didn't read the books in a long time.
