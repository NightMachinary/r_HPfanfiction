The problem with that is your assuming that say petunia and lilys parents knew about the magical world before lily got her letter and that they were squibs in some fashion.

Thats not true Vernon and Petunia arent squibs they are muggles. Normal people. A squib is a muggle born in the magical world. As i said earlier JK has no idea how to properly world build her magic system.
