[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]]: Is an interesting extreme AU where Salazar Slytherin instituted a caste system. It's incomplete at the moment and updates are sadly irregular, well worth the read however. linkffn(9783012)

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
