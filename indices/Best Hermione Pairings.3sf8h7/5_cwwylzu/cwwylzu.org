This is a niche one but Hermione /Theo nott. He is completely a name in the books and hardly fleshed out, but if you like Hermione with slytherins and smart men, he usually fills that gap. And also because we know so little about him, authors usually use him as their own unique character. What we do know is that he's friends with Draco and they were close ish based on something JKR said, and that he is quite clever. So in my mind I think it may work.
