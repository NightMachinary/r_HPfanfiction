linkffn(Sin & Vice by mak5258) is a really really good time-travel Severus/Hermione. The author's summary is dreadful, but I was completely engrossed. Over the winter holidays in Hermione's sixth year, Dumbledore sends her back in time six months to get extra training. And then continues sending her back and back again. Real plot picks up after Voldemort returns at the end of the 4th book. Hermione is essentially in her late 20's but she's never turned back before 1994. She's as isolated and damaged as Severus and the story picks up from there.
