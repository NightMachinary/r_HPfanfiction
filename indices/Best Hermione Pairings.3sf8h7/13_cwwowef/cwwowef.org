Well. Thinking about it, the obvious answer is Percy Weasley.

They would be the only the only two people who could stand each other all the time. Anyone else would get annoyed by the other. Both of them refuse to acknowledge that they're in the wrong until it stares them in the face, so that's another quality they both have. Both go on and on about rules, but break rules themselves when they see fit.

Sounds as good a match as it can get.
