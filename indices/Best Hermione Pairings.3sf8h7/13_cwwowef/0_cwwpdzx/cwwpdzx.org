Sounds like a recipe for disaster, even more than Hermione & Ron. The best couples have different but complimentary traits- if one is brash the other is diplomatic. One is ambitious then the other should be supportive. The important traits to align would be values, feelings about child-raising and money-handling, similar senses of humour and agreement on sexual expectations. This doesn't require identical belief systems, just agreeable ones.

Percy and Hermione would compete in the same arenas with neither likely to give an inch if they're strong in their convictions on something. The sex might be great, but the relationship would be a fiasco.
