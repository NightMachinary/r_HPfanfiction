Personally, I think that Hermione x Power is my favorite even though I can't remember any right now. My post canon headcanon for her is the marriage to Ron failing horribly and her just snapping one day over how brainless everyone else is, faking her own death in some kind of explosion that kills Ron and becoming a dark lord.
