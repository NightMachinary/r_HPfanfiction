My all-time favourite SSHG time travel would have to be linkffn(Pride of Time). I think the author really keeps both Hermione and Severus in character. I actually have a whole list of fics I've read and asterisks next to the ones that I particularly enjoyed. Let me know if there Is a particular pairing you're looking for, and I can check my list. There's also a few crossover pairings with Hermione that I enjoy. Spencer Reid (Criminal Minds)/Hermione is one of my favorites.

I ship Hermione with almost every male out there, except for Death Eaters (minus Lucius) the older Order members, and Peter Pettigrew.
