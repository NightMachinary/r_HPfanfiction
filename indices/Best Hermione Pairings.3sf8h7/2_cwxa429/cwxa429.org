I'm surprised nobody has mentioned Draco/Hermione, considering it's the most popular pairing on FFN. It's not my favorite pairing, since those fics tend to be OOC or spend a lot of time on Draco learning not to be a bigot.

That being said, just due to the sheer number of fics, it's possible to find well-written stories, even if it's not your cup of tea. I've enjoyed a few that are set years after Hogwarts, since they can start fresh with Draco's character. For example: linkffn(5498748; 3878384).
