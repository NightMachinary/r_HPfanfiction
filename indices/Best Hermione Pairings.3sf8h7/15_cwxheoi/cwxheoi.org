I don't think it's the best, seriously my all-time favourites are Draco/Hermione and Severus/Hermione, but that very unusual pairing somehow kind of worked out in that fic, so in a thread about Hermione pairings I thought I'd link it.

People often say Draco has to be very OOC for dramione to work out, but I don't believe that. In the last two books he is getting a serious dose of reality that made him question things he had thought to be true all his life about what is right and what is wrong. How far isn't clear in canon, but you can be perfectly canon compliant while claiming things Harry doesn't know, as long as it doesn't interfere with his observations.

Although it's a tragedy, I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3187054/1/For-You-Always-For-You][For You, Always For You]] is one of the better (short) dramione fics there is.

And since you asked for it, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5500156/1/Tempora-Abducto][Tempora Abducto]] is my favourite tomione story so far.
