If you want to see a canon timeline Snape/Hermione that is well done, I highly, highly recommend linkffn(Pet Project by Caeria). It was the first SS/HG fic I read and it really showed how such an improbable relationship could have developed during the canon timeline. For SS/HG time turner fics, linkffn(An Unwritten Future by Aurette) is probably my favorite.

Also Draco/Hermione is probably one of the most popular non-Harry centered ships in the fandom and great fic for that pairing is linkffn(Isolation by Bex-chan).
