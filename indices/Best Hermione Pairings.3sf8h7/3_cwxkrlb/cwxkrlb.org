I would say "When a lioness fights," is the best Snape and hermione. However I personally like h/hr stories. Mostly because I see her as the strongest female character/alternate protagonist in canon. I like stories where the protagonist has an equal who is great to read about. Hermione being incredibly smart and powerful fits for me. Madscientist on portkey has written a few great h/hr stories. As background I love the sword of truth series because while the main protagonist is powerful and interesting his wife is also the same.
