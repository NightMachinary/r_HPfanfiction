You should also try Bill or Charlie/Hermione. There aren't a ton that I like but they're so fun. [[http://www.witchfics.org/anna/romanholiday/index.html][Roman Holiday]] has 1.5 sequels and is long and has some non-time travel SSHG but should be read for the other pairings and for the plot and everything.

Most of the Charlie fics I've read are more smut but are still good.

linkffn(Spellcaster) is forced marriage SSHG and very different. Also try linkffn(Protective Custody; Sucker Punch; A Big Ball of Wibbly-Wobbly; The Nietzsche Classes; Mine, Always)
