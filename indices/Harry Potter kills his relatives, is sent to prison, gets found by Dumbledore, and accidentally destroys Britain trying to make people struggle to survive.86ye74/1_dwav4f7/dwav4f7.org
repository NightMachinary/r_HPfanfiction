This reminds me of another story if anyone can help me with it. I think it starts before 5th year when they come for his wand. Tonks shows up and Harry imperius's her to fight against the order, which he feels bad about because they're friends. He gets sent to Azkaban and Dumbledore (after a while) convinces the WG to free him, believing he was possessed (or something)
