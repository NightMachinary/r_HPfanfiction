You know I actually read a WBWL fic that turned these facts on their head in an original way. Don't Ask me what story it is. Cause I'm sure it was long since abandoned. ANd I'd never be able to find it again. But here we go.

Tom shows up kills sirus who was babyitting. Cue black family magic protections.

Standard stuff.

But here's where we differ.

Harry who is boy who lived. Has a horcrux stuck to him. Everyone just thinks its leftover magic from Killing curse.

Enter Time skip.

3 months later said soul fragment is slowly killing harry and nobody knows what to do.

They decide after some heavy talking it's better he lives away from magic as a squib then die before 2 years old. Potters and dumbledore believing that magic is not the only thing that matters in life. That muggles can be nice and happy as well. So they seal away his magic and give him to dursleys with a lengthy discussion about why they are doing this.

Dursleys are distant but decent.

Enter Car crash for some reason. Everyone dies but harry and dudley. both infants end up in different orphanages. Exit dudley from story. No one knows what harry's last name is. so they give him the name riddle. (Partly as a Pun..Also riddle being a rather common name in muggle world.)

Now enter horcrux. Because his magic was seeal horcrux slowly weakens until Harry absorbs it. and thus breaking magic free. Has side effect of changing harry hair and eye color. Cue bullying from other kids that make harry sorta anti social. Finding solace in learning an d snakes.

Enter hogwarts letter to Harry Riddle at St. orphanage.

Cue Freakout from everybody who thinks Voldemort has a son who grew up in remarkably similar circumstances to his father and has many of the same abilities and talents.

Lily and James hate him because they think he is the son of the guy who killed off many members of their family.

Death eaters in the know think he is their future lord.

Dumdbledore does not trust him but feels like its his responsibly to not fail him by letting him repeat history and go the path of his father.

And voldemort wondering how His diary got free will and lost it's memories. (Thinking about maybe he shuld not have made 7 anchors after all.)
