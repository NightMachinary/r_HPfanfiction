Real story... Last time I managed to find it was more than 3 years ago. Back in 2018, at least. I remember it well because I've never seen a fic like it since. Sometimes a fic stays with you. But I think it was canceled sometime in the beginning of CoS.. Before Filch's cat was petrified.

First year was pretty different from canon because Harry did not a a reason to go for the stone. So If any of that happened. It's in the background.

Never found out if the CoS would have even happened.
