Not gonna lie, I personally enjoy that trope, but can definitely appreciate this post at the same time. There was actually one that was semi decent by Watermelonsmellinfellon called You Get What You Give, where it has a genderbent HP with a sister who's the GWL. It actually treats the WGWL kind of normally. Like, she's an annoying brat sometimes but not irredeemable at the same time. End game pairing is supposed to be Tom Riddle Jr x Genderbent!HP. Hasn't been updated in two years but it's an almost 500,000 word fic.
