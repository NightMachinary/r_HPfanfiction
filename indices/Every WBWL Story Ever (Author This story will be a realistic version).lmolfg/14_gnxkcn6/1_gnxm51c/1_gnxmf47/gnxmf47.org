Yes it sounds pretty weird. But I promise you it is one of the best written fanfictions I have ever read. It is so good. It could be considered a little grimdark but it just does it so well. I would ask you to give it at least a try but I can't make a random person on the internet do anything lol. It really picks up around chapter 20, I believe. And the buildup to the eventual “Adrian is Harry” thing is so worth it.
