It's not for everyone. I'm pretty sure that most of the people who read it both love and hate that fic and a year later I'm still not sure if I liked it or not. Don't get me wrong: I was hooked on it. Couldn't put the damn thing down. But... it's not usually my thing, and its not a good idea to read it when depressed. Want something happy? Don't read Antithesis.

I cried ugly tears at the end, and I really, really, REALLY wanted to murder a certain bitch near the finale as well (and nope, your guess who is so very wrong). Pretty sure that bitch (who shall remain nameless because spoilers) wins the award for most hated character in this fandom, hands down.
