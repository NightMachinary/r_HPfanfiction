It's kind of painful how accurate this depiction is. Nearly every WBWL fanfic that I've read has the same premise and they're all just a culmination of a teenage edge lord's idyllic world. Personally, I'd like to read a fanfic where Harry is just a little neglected because Lily and James are trying to protect BWL and figure out why he survived by consulting different magical academics. During that time, Harry becomes an introverted bookworm, learning to strengthen his magic, and then has a normal time at Hogwarts where he becomes the Tom Riddle or Albus Dumbledore of his generation--maybe delving a little into his journey and how different it is without the BWL title. The author could then take it either way with Harry being BWL or recruit Harry into the Order or smthn. Idk, just a thought lol. Better than having some of the most compassionate witches and wizards instantly abusing Harry because he's not famous.
