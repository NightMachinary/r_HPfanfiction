Along with his parents, ancestors and brother never getting even half a chance of inheriting or even knowing about it despi te Harry only receiving it because of the ancestors he shares with his parents and brother. Seriously, don't know which excuse is the most absurd: Harry was the first person on the entire history of his family to do this test which the Goblins seem to petty much throw in their customers' faces, Harry only getting it because the Goblins decided that he is the first decent human being on the history of the world and so they obviously have to bend their own rules towards and backwards to give Harry as many inheritance as possible throwing away even the illusion of neutrality and thus (in a realistic setting that is) ruining their own business since the customers will become afraid of them disregarding all laws and rules to give their things to whoever they happen to like or even the excessively simplistic “magic likes me better, so suck it!”.
