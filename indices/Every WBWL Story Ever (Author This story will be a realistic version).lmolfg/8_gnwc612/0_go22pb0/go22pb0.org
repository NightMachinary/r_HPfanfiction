To be honest, if trained wizards, with decades of experience, wants to rely on a 16 year old to solve their problems, their own problems they themselves caused, then they deserve dealing with voldemort.

Also, with how Riddle was introduced into magic, with Dumbledore seemingly burning his possesions, no matter if they weren't his, he values them highly, no wonder he craved magic and strength so much, so that he wouldn't feel helpless ever again. Doesn't excuse his genocide, but you can see where is this coming from...
