Nope it just this trope is all horribly out of character. Why would James and especially Lily abandon one of their sons to her sister when in canon she dies for her child. It makes no sense. It's all just so Harry can be abused and feel left out and be a edge lord. They don't shape the character choice to fit a logical conclusion with what we know of the characters. Harry in these story's is basically an OC with Harry's name or not even his name. Why not just make your own story at this point?
