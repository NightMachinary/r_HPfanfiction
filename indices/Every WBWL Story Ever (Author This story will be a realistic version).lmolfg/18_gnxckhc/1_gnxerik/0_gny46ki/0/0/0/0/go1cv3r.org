Seems legit.

When I first got on reddit, I was honestly surprised to see how few people hated or bashed Ron after my experience on the rest of the fandom. Of course, there are still posts like "Ron Weasley is a parasite who deserves to die" and "The only reason Hermione fell in love with Ron was because he imperiused her", but overall reddit turned out to be pretty fair not to only Ron, but other characters as well.

As to the hate contest, Dumbledore is hated by more people while the hate against Ron is more intense. I mean, even Dumbledore doesn't have fics like this - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5248438/1/101-Ways-to-Kill-Ron-Weasley]] for the sole purpose of killing him.
