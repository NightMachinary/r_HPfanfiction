Kind of? Besides some requests for Ron!Bashing that show up from time to time (and which sound kind of like the requester is just curious) there are far more posts in the sub which either trash Ron!Bashing, go deep into why Ron is actually a very well-written character or request/prompt stories where Ron is a good and well-written character.

On the other hand the fandom itself is soaked full of Ron!Bashing, it sometimes seems like a competition among fandom!Ron and fandom!Dumbledore to see who is the most bashed and they are petty much tied at this point. Some say that it is because of how the movies gave his best moments to either Harry or Hermione and either white-washed or just jumped over his best and more endearing moments in the same way most of H&Hr worst moments were just ignored, kind of the opposite of what happened with Snape.
