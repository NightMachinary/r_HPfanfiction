Also, why James and Lily have to abandonned him to begin with ?

Harry can feel neglected and a bitter while growing up with his special famed brother, that got all the attention, all the training, way more time with his parents since they are training the Chosen ones, while Harry also suffer from all the sacrifice made for Brother by his family.

James and Lily can still adore Harry but circomstances don't really allow them to spend as much attention and time with Harry despite how much they wished they could. Everytime they try, it's cut short for Chosen Ones stuff. Any of Harry own issues can never been the focus because Chosen One stuff will always be more important.

Harry's a child, it's easy for them to confuse James and Lily responsabilities as the parent of the Chosen One for James and Lily not liking him as much as his brother. And be resentful of that. And Resentful of his brother for that.
