Yup! Half the fun in discussing among ourselves is sharing our hate poems for tropes!😜😊😁😁👍✌️

But being seriously, it is not so much that we completely hate the premise as much as it is that there are so many stories using those tropes that could easily be copied from each other or that are just plainly bad-written (often both) that we opt to seek for originality by highlighting what we absolutely hate on the troop or come here to rant and unwind a bit with likeminded people.

The very fact that we know so much about the tropes is a sign that we have tried again and again to find those we like but had no success. After the thousandth time Indy!Harry defeats Dumbledore and his family by essentially screaming very loud and throwing a tantrum at the DMLE which should have better things to do than bend themselves to the whims of a kid it loses even the barest hint of enjoyment that it had in the beginning, if you are not there yet than you will probably get there if you stay long enough in the fandom.
