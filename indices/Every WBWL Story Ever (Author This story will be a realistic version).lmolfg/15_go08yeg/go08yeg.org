You know there was one called the children who lived or something, it was abandoned. But the sorry line was that Harry and Charles are twins and James and Lily test them both fairly and while Harry is prodigious in transfiguration and his twin is prodigious in potions, they both share a love for charms. They are not great, just gave a good amount of power, skill and work hard. When Harry goes to accept the position of Potter Heir, they discover Lily is desenced from a long line of squibs from Salazar Slytherin. Thus explaining parseltounge and also giving charles heirship of a house. It is still more realistic than the normal shitty wbwl stories.
