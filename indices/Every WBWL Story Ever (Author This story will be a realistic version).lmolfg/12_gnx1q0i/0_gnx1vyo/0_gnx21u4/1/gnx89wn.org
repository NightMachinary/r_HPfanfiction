There (usually) isn't any blood magic. The justification for dumping Harry with the Dursleys usually has something to do with him being jealous of his brother or Lily and James not having time for him or everyone thinking he's a squib or Dumbledore hoping he'll quietly die because he knows about the horcrux in his scar or everyone just being stupid and cruel for no real reason. And Voldemort is gone for now and any remaining Death Eaters also think that Harry's brother is the Boy-Who-Lived, so there's no need for any blood protections anyway.
