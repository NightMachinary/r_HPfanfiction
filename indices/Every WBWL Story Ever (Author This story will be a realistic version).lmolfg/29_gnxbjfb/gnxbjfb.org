How about something based of the classic WMG? Keep the story like the canon, but the true BWL is Neville.

As potter do his adventure, Neville simply start to befriend students from different houses & being middle-man & judge for a lot of house-rivalry problems, wich irks Slytherin at first because they think Neville will be bias toward Griffindor, but start to take that thought back when not only there are times when he sided on Slytherin against his own house, his advices for both side, while simple, it's good enough to make them better person eventually. Draco could be more cordial, or, at least, appear so for Neville since he's a Longbottom

Eventually, Griffindor become as diligent as Ravenclaw, Slytherins become as open-book emotionally as Hupplepuf, while the House members is still separared by rooms & core personality, there will be less non-academic related rivalry & students are more willing to hangout or eat together on other tables beside their house's, and Death Eaters will have a hard time getting new recruits from Slytherin (or actually have easier time, now that other houses members could also posses the kind of personality they can recruit & mold. I'm not picky. I kinda wanna see Griffindor Death Eater for once, blaberring how "The Muggles need to re-learn true courage & chivalry we, the Griffindor, posses")

Eventually, these students will be united to protect Hogwarts as one, lead by Neville Longbottom, The Boy Who Unites
