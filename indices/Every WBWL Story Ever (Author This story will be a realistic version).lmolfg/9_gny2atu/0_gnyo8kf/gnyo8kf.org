Voldemort: Throws some ungodly powerful spell at dunce-prick over his shoulders while dueling epically against Harry, Dumbledore and the order.

Dunce-Prick: tries to cast a protego, but accidentally picked his pet rock (which is actually an erumpent horn but nobody ever bothered telling him) and was thrown on the wall by the explosion. A mirror that was conveniently hanging precariously from the celling falls with the impact right in the path of Voldy's curse. The curse somehow reflects on the mirror instead of blasting it apart while barely slowing down like it should.

Voldemort: Is hit by his own spell and dies immediately.

Harry:”... What the actual fuck?!”

Their parents, the order and literally everyone else: All hail Dunce-Prick Potter! The Boy who kind off killed Voldemort! All our previous treatment of Harry is now perfectly justified no matter how cruel and unfair and we take back all our heartfelt begging for forgiveness!

Dunce-Prick: Me thinks head broke, will drank firewhiskey to de-break, leg-shirt brown and water again, chocolate yummy-yummy-yummy.

Harry:”... Seriously, What the fuck?!?”
