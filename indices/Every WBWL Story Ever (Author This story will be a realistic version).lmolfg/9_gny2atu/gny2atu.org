  Harry: I'm a dark sociopath now and I hate my parents

  WBWL: I a conceited prick that can barely do magic now (even though I'm the child of two people with powerful magic)

The twist I want to see is getting what we think is a usual WBWL story where everyone eventually realizes that Harry is the true boy who lived but...

In the end it is revealed that it was the WBWL, a.k.a. dunce-prick, who really was the boy who lived. Kinda like those heist movies (Oceans Eleven, Now You See Me, etc.) where the trick is revealed in the end.

It can go either way, dunce-prick was actually hiding a cunning side or he was still a dunce but an incredibly lucky one and the defeat of Voldemort was a series of hilarious coincidences.
