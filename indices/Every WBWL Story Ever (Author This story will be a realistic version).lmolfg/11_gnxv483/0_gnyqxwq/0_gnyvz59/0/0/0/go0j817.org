That is why I can't read so many stories. It's fine if you want to create an AU, have crazy plotlines, etc, but at the very least I want the characterizations to be the generally the character I recognize. Harry should be recognizable as Harry, Hermione as Hermione, etc. Parents who gave their lives for their sons in canon all of sudden becoming cruel to their child is ridiculous.
