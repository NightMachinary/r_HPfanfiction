Adding on, Dumbledore explains all this to Harry and everything is a ruse. Harry and Dumbledore mislead everyone and make them think he has turned evil, joined Voldemort. Instead, he was there hindering Voldemort and subtly protecting his innocent brother. Voldemort does not care to look into it because he is causing a divide in the family and is supposedly weakening Dumbledore, who is torn.

Harry and his brother exchange letters, actually have a very good relationship. After Voldemort is defeated, Harry works with James and Lily, attempting to mend their broken relationship.
