I would really like a WBWL fan fiction where Dumbledore is entirely in the know of the identity of the BWL. So Dumbledore knows that Harry is the one who was marked by Voldemort, but purposefully misleads the Potters/wizarding population by presenting the sibling as the saviour. Why? It would mean that Harry is in less danger, is under less scrutiny and maybe allows Dumbledore more control over how Harry develops while having a convenient scapegoat who will be targeted.

This would allow for a different relationship between Dumbledore and both the Potter siblings, while also allowing the writer more freedom in how Harry deals with his problems (having Dumbledore secretly be on Harry's side and guiding him) while still having a lot of conflict between Harry and his family.
