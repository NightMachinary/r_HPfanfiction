Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived]]

It's abandoned during 4th year, but it's one of the most well known fics and is very good. Definitely a must read imo if you are into HP fanfiction.

The summary is

Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
