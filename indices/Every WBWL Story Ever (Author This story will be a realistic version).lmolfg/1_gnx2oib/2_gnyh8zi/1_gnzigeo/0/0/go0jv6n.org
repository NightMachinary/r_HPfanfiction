Saw it used in a cool way once in a story where Harry's family was descendent of that king that was deposed before the current dynasty took the throne, it was interesting because it was mostly just a throwaway bit of family story, no one outside the family even /knew/ about it and the family itself (including Harry) never even tried for the throne, their only nod was having everyone on the family having the names used by the royal family (Eg. Charlus=Charles, Harry=Henry, James, Edward...) which seems to be common enough on the UK.
