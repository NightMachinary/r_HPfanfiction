You're in the minority, I think.

I'm okay-ish with Harold or Henry, those names actually track for "de-upper-classing" to Harry.

Harrison is a patronym, "Son of Harry". It is not, contrary to popular belief, a way to make the name "Harry" more upper-class.

The closest thing to a lower-class version of Hadrian is "Adrian". It in no way, shape or form turns into "Harry". On an unrelated note, several baby-name websites I've checked will actually warn you away from "Hadrian" as trying way too hard to sound upper-class.

All of that said, it's usually the accompanying trope-fest that makes me not want to read the fic. I've had my fill of "Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin-Ambrosius-Christ-Caesar-Odinson gets betrayed by Dumbledork and the Weasels, luckily he remembered the name Griphook so the goblins will wipe his bum for him".

TL;DR if you have to give Harry a more "formal" name, use Harold or Henry instead. And please, avoid becoming Yet Another Lord-Potter-wankfest.
