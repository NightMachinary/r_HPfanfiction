Harrison sounds like an old, smart, ass dude who annoys everyone with that "UhM, AcTuAlLy..." Bullshit and his overbearing desire to rule everything.

But I honestly love Hadrian. It is elegant and lovely, rolls easily of your tongue, kinda sounds like royalty, at least to me and sounds old but also new. I like Hadrian more like Harry.
