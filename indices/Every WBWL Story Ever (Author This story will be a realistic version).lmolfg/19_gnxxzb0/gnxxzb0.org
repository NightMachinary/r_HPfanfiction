I'd love to see it get the beta treatment, but Birth of a Phoenix is worth a shot for a less tropey WBWL. The reason Harry is neglected/runs away is even somewhat realistic - I don't /agree/ with it and it pisses me off... but I can see it happening nonetheless.

Then again, is it really wbwl when they're both considered the bwl initially? linkffn(3503388)
