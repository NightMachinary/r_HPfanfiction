*Harry Potter and the Questionable Magic of Quidditch*

(The last line is in italics. Thoughts.)

Harry was sitting in bar talking. "Well, I was going to Hogwarts when I was nine and my parents decided to take me to a Muggle place to be near relatives. Well, my parents ended up being killed, my aunt and uncle were taken in, and my Uncle Ronald was sent to Azkaban. It didn't have to happen that way. I could have been with my parents, but I didn't have a clue how."

"It's the same with all of the children, I'm sure." Moody said.

"They had me and Ron as little kids."

Moody nodded, still seeming to have his wand hand over his heart, "Yes. We were raised here by Muggles. Harry's parents were both Muggles as well, you were too."

"And my parents were?" Hermione said, curiously.

Moody looked at the little boy and his mother in turn. They had a bit of a look, the same one they had when they had first met, when they first brought Harry to St Mungo's. A look of uncertainty. "I wouldn't know. I've been out of the service for three years. But they were never the same since the Falklands."

Moody turned to Harry again. "You're a Weasley, aren't you? How did that happen? You must be really famous. Everyone knows that a Weasley is a famous wizard."

Harry nodded. "It was my aunt and uncle who were famous, wasn't it?"

"Yes, I suppose that explains why there was only one of them." Hermione said. "You're from the same family, I'm sure, yes?"

Harry nodded again, and Moody's hand fisted itself in Harry's hair. "Yes, well. I didn't really know him all that well before we met, but I knew he was a wizard. The Order knew too, even. He's... a prick. I guess it'd be a bad name to call him, but it's the only way I can put it."

"It is, sir." Dumbledore nodded, his tone light. "I'm sure that you know where Harry is."

"Of course, Headmaster. I'm in Wales."

"Very good, Harry. Now, about the mission."

"Why? Why us?"

"I've told you the reasons, Harry. You can't just stand by and watch as your life is taken away from you, and your friend is betrayed, then have no reason to help him. You and Hermione must save Ronald."

"I didn't have any choice."

"It's not a choice. You're not choosing, Harry. You're doing something that you have to do, and something you'll have to live with the rest of your life, no matter what." Hermione said, her eyes filling with tears.

"I... I don't know what I should do." Moody said. "I wish I could... "

"I don't blame you. There's no shame in asking the right questions. But you can't just sit there, like an idiot. Hermione's right. I should... help." He said, and she hugged him tightly. "Harry, you should know. I am having your children."

Harry nodded. "So that's why you asked me to... go with you to Scotland. It's just..." He stopped and looked at the door. "Ronald is in Wales. I'm not ready yet, Moody. I have to do some things."

Moody nodded. "I understand. I don't think we'll ever see each other again. I hope I won't have to say goodbye to your uncle, but he is kind of a prick."

Dumbledore looked as if he had just had a very bad dream, and drank some beer. "I'll try to keep everyone informed."

Moody frowned. "He can see you, right?"

"He's a senior member of the Wizengamot, Moody. He's one of the people who can override your authority. He can cancel Hermione."

"So he's saying the Headmaster is going to take advantage of that to try and kill Hermione?"

"That's right. He's just trying to get his hands on her." Harry said. "And I don't blame him. He'd probably make a better Lord Voldemort than I would."

Moody's eyes narrowed. "What do you mean, he's a Lord Voldemort?"

"Look, this is serious business. We've got to get Ronald back," Harry said.

"This is serious business?" Moody looked puzzled. "I'm not a student anymore. I know you've got this whole thing figured out. He's just a bit of a prick."

"This isn't a prank," Harry said, standing up and pointing at him. "We're talking about you."

"Oh. Well, if you think that's serious business, I might just get on board with it."

Harry turned to Moody. "I have a little favor to ask you."

Moody looked at the two of them expectantly. "Sure."

"Would you be willing to take the fall for me and put the headmaster away?" Harry asked. "If I screw up the plan, you'll be held responsible for the consequences."

Moody looked like Christmas had come early. Dumbledore took another sip of beer.

"Harry," Dumbledore said. "I was forced to use the same method as you. It wasn't a happy day for me, or for anyone, that you'd become involved in the battle. There were some good people there, including Snape, good people on both sides."

"You're not mad at me?" Harry asked.

Dumbledore blinked. "Not mad. I can't say that I really care. That's Hermione's responsibility, and yours. I don't know. Hermione was being a horrible little girl, and I just wanted to give her a break. I liked that. But you were in the infirmary at the time, and I knew I wouldn't be able to get you out."

"I like beer." Hermione said.
