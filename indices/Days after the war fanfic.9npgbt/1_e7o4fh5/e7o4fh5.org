What were you reading the fic on? Phone (I'm assuming based on your last comment), Computer, App? [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]], AO3 or somewhere else? You should be able to check your browser history to find it if it was recent.

Do you remember much else? Did they specifically call it a black mark? Reason I'm asking is I'm usually pretty good at tracking down fics but searching for 'black mark' is bringing up all of the fics that say 'dark mark' which is unfortunately not going to narrow it down at all.
