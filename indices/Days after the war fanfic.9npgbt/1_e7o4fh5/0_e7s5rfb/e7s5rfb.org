It was a link I opened on my phone through the reddit app , unfortunately I didn't open it in safari so it's not in my history, gah! I think it was in the fanfic website as there were suggestions for other stories at the bottom of the page. Hmm it was only discovered by madam pomfrey and described as a sort of black veiny mark from what I can recall! He awakes, Hermione is in ron's bed next to him they go get some toast then walk to the lake then to madam pomfrey then back to the lake I think, then Ron finds them. That's as far as I got. I've just started these cuts I have and in thre it's described as a lightning shape like his forehead so not the same story but it's really good so far!

Edit: just saw someone found it:fulfilling obligations. Though I'm really enjoying these cuts I have!!
