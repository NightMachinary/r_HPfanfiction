I skimmed it because I didn't /want/ to read the details and want to forget what I /did/ read, but I think she used some "Witchcraft" (as opposed to "Wizardcraft"---because only witches can practice the former) to grow his penis like a tentacle, which she then used to penetrate his mouth. She may have hurt him in other ways as well.

It was technically not illegal because it was some pureblood law duel or some such, but Dumbledore expelled her for this brutality. There was some whining by Hermione about how The Law made it easier to expel a muggleborn than a pureblood, or some such. But then, Madame Maxine admitted her to Beauxbatons on the spot, so there were no real consequences.

I think she ended up leading some kind of a righteous magical creature revolution, and then Harry stabbed her in the back and killed her.
