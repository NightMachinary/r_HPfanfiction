It's tragic, that's what it is.

Hermione in that fic is knowledgeable, powerful, and confident, and that's a good thing. But, look at how petty and small the author makes her.

All that power used to what end? To torture and rape (and yes, that is the correct word to use here) a teenage boy for the crime of throwing a jealous temper tantrum. All that knowledge? Used to come up with a way to use the law to avoid the full consequences of her gratuitous brutality.

Writers like pstibbons bash Hermione worse than most Hermione-haters.
