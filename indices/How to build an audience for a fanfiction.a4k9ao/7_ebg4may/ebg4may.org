Honestly I don't think there's a magic formula. If there is, I haven't found it. In over four years of posting fics I've never gathered much of anything and I've tried pretty much everything that's been advised in this thread without any perceptible effect. It's easy to conclude that a fic with few comments is simply bad---and I'm afraid most people will assume it's not worth reading, but I don't think it's that simple. Some people hit the sweet spot and some don't. Ultimately you have to believe in what you're doing, and sometimes that has to be enough.
