Don't expect a ton of reviews and favourites at first. I was nearly ten chapters in before it built any traction. So don't give up and continue writing.

Write a good summary and specify if it's AU or canon-compliant, tag the primary and secondary characters and any established romantic pairs if any.

Especially important is to update often and consistently. Have a schedule. I find updating on Sunday mornings working very well for me. Or you can pick a good time slot like Tuesdays or Thursdays and update on the dot, at least at first. So people, especially guest readers will come to expect your update on a certain time and come looking for your fic.

You can cross-post on AO3 too, because some stories bizarrely work really well on one website but not on the other.

One little tip I realized only later, is to make your story look professionally edited. If it's a multi-chapter fic, give each chapter a name and number, differentiate each scenes with a line-break and refrain from A/N at the beginning of each chapter (A/N at the beginning of first chapter is completely fine as you can give a detailed summary to attract more potential readers).

Reply to every review, even if it was just a single word, as this encourages repeat reviewing.

Also, never hold chapters for hostage saying you won't post without a certain number of follows or reviews. You're writing because you like it and want to share it with others. If you get some reviews along the way, then hey that's a sweet treat, but not a complete necessity.
