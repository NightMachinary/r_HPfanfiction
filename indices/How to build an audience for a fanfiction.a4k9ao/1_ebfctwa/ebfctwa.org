Write good stuff. Without that, you're pretty much sunk. Seek to be as professional in quality as you can manage.

Be an avid reviewer on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. As an author, I've often clicked on reviewers' links (particularly those who offer substantive, useful reviews) and see whether they've written something I might want to read. Authors often write some of the best reviews, as they know what they themselves would like to see, and I've been a reader of fanfiction for longer than I've been a writer. When popular authors start linking your stories, you'll get an outsized knock-on effect in terms of exposure.

Join a writing group or two. DLP works for some. I got a ton of help from the fellow writers (jbern, nonjon, BajaB, CheddarTrek, Voice of the Nephilim, Draco664, Heather Sinclair, etc.) at AFC. Another is the Teachers Lounge on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. When possible, do reciprocative reading and reviewing of others' work in your group. Build your footprint, increase your cross section.

Participate in writing contests. People who check out contest pieces may check out your other pieces you've written. And if you win, so much the better for your exposure.

Manage your public persona. Be gracious and calm in public and, when possible, don't be a prima donna. If people think you're an inveterate douchebag, most won't read your stuff no matter how great you think it might be.
