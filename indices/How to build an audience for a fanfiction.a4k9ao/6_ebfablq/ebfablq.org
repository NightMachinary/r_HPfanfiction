Make a recommendation post for it on this sub; whenever you see a Request thread here that fits the story, don't be afraid to cite it. If you're feeling brave, make a thread for it on /DLP/, but be warned that some of the reviewers there are orthodox or perfectionist to the point of bullying.

Getting your fic indexed on TVtropes is another good way to attract new readers, but you need to make sure the page is well-maintained.
