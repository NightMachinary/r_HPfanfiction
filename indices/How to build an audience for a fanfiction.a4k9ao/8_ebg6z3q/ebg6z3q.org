Include a lot of popular characters with little content for them (any of the Tonks, Narcissa, Bellatrix, Pansy, Fleur) AND include Harry. It's not difficult to gain some traction that way, as long as your concept is somewhat decent and original. Humour and romance is a good recipe for popularity ("Drool" got me over three hundred favs after one chapter and it was horribly written back then).

Of course, don't just randomly add stuff to farm popularity. You need to be sold on the idea, otherwise, you will lose interest.
