Start with a good, honest summary. Few will check out an “I suck at summaries, just read it” fic. Same goes for a good title.

Make sure to tag your main characters, any romances, and the genre so that the fic will show up for someone looking for new work of a certain sort.

Update regularly. Somewhere between once a week and every other day will give you the best chance to be seen regularly so that eventually someone moderately curious will click.

Expect to start slow. A few reviews and follows for the first few chapters may multiply exponentially by later chapters. So don't give up early, especially as you have so much already written.

Happy posting!
