How to get into that part of Tumblr? The only place I found entertaining was the Bellamione shitpost community (even though I don't ship it). Everything else felt like:

- "my pairing is better than yours" circlejerks (no matter which pairing, this is cringeworthy)

- AUs where everyone is black (as opposed to a representative depiction of Britain in the 90s)

- A deluge of slash

- Death Eater whitewashing

- Canon/Weasley pairings

I mean, I made a blog there supposedly dedicated to Harry Potter, but somehow I ended up with mostly Mass Effect stuff on my dash because the quality of the content was lightyears ahead. People keep creating amazing art for that fandom, while HP felt like a bunch of recycled GIF-sets and drawings of Black Hermione. I haven't found a single decent blog for any of the popular f/m Harry ships.
