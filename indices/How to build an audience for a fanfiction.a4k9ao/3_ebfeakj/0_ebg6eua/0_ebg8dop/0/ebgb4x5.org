  I mean, you curate who you follow, I'm sorry you didn't find the right people for you.

Obviously. I have some experience with Tumblr, but I really didn't find a single HP blog for the pairings I am interested in (I had no issues with the same in the ME fandom).

Most either randomly throw Malfoy into everything or go on huge tangents to state why pairing X is the OTP and everything else is shite.
