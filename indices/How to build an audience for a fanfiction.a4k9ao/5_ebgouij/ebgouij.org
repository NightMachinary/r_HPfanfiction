First off, as I believe several others have already mentioned here: don't expect tons of followers, favorites and reviews right off the bat. Usually, most people won't even bother clicking on a story that has less than 50,000 words (unless it is a one-shot or two-shot fic, of course) as they realize they will most likely get stuck waiting for new chapters to be released. Most would rather wait until your story has accumulated some chapters before they begin reading.

​

Second, have a clear schedule (I suck at this). Upload chapters either weekly, bi-weekly or monthly (last one usually only works if your chapters are lengthy and take a while to read). People hate having to guess when the next chapter is coming out, and prefer knowing in advance when to expect the next piece of content. This also makes life easier for guest readers who don't have an account.

​

Third, try to make your story look and read as professionally as possible. Don't get me wrong, grammar mistakes are perfectly acceptable, as long as there is not an overwhelming majority of them. Formatting your story to look as clean and organized as possible also helps.

​

Fourth, have a clear plan and write a good story. I know that might sound like the most obvious tip ever, but really, you'd be surprised at the amount of recycled garbage there is out there. Even most of my own stories fall into this particular pitfall. Try to write something that sets your story apart from everyone else's. Something that people maybe haven't read a thousand times already.
