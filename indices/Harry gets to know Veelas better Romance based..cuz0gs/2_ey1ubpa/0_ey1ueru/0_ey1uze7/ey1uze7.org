I don't understand why so many authors do that. If you don't like Ron or Ginny just don't include them in the story. If it's set post-Hogwarts and you feel it is necessary to explain why Harry and Ginny are not together just have a paragraph saying they dated for a while and split up. You don't need to make her a fame-whore or a cheating slut, people often just find that they are not compatible and break up.
