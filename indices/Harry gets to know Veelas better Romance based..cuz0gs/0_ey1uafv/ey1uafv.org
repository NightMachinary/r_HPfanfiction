Boy do I have a gift for you.

-<HP>-

Harry/Fleur (otherwise known as "Flowerpot") is my OTP, and I have a veritable library of fics in that pairing (40 in all) and I felt like sharing them.

Before any other Fic is recommended, here is one of my favorites. It was taken down from Fanfiction.net and now only exists in this archive. It is a miracle, lightning in a bottle, a blend of the absurd humor of a crack fic with the literary skill of Shakespeare. It is without doubt worth a full read.

Before I begin, please know this. Not all these fics are complete. Not all these fics are long, not all these fics are short, not all these fics are recent or even good. What they are, is a record. A history written in other people's words, a history of the love and passion of a single person for Harry Potter manifesting itself in a way familiar to all of Us here. This is my OTP. Starting with my all time favorite fic in the HP fandom.

*EDIT:* This comment is a copy of a post I made awhile back detailing all fics I had which featured a Harry/Fleur pairing.
