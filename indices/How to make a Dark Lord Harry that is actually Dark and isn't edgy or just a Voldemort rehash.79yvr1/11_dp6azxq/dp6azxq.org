One good way to avoid Voldemort 2.0 is to look at the antagonists of other series and try to combine them in interesting ways.

My 3 suggestions:

Darth Vader :)

Raistlin Majere (From DragonLance. The Soulforge is an excellent tale of a young wizard destined to be evil. Read just the first chapter to get an idea.)

The bad guys from the Dresden Files (Dark Magic is addictive angle).
