I already have a plan for the Statute of Secrecy. It eventually falls, but only because Harry makes a massive error.

I'll change the conflict around so it's less about blood status (though this will still be a minor part) and more about politics. When the Statute falls, the Ministry falls with it, and now Britain is descended into Anarchy. So now you'll have wizards and muggles not knowing what the hell to do with each other, with some on both sides calling for blood and some calling for a united government.
