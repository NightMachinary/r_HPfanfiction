Your Dark Lord Harry is too similar to Death Eaters in terms of ideology. I think Harry would have a different motivation. A Dark Lord Harry would, in my opinion, be more alike to Grindelwald than to Voldemort. He'd see himself as a benevolent dictator for whom the end justifies the means.

Also, I wouldn't make the conflict about blood status, but about the self-imposed segragation of wizards. He could resent the Statute of Secrecy because it makes wizards appear weak and because it limits their possibilities in life.
