I'm currently writing a fic about something very similar. Please note my Reddit name and if you're reading any fics under the same name, it's probably me and spoilers are inbound so I can contribute to this post. :) Sorry! However, if you want to spoil my own story that I'll never link, feel free.

The Harry in my fic is different to almost every other dark Harry fic that I have read. He grew up loved, had his parents, was punished just like a normal person. Sometimes his parents messed up and he was ignored, but he was not abused at all. His hatred comes from the fact that someone else (the BWL) was famous, popular, and well-known and he wasn't. It seems so petty, doesn't it? All Harry wanted to be was well-known, famous, and what everyone talked about.

However, that's the start of his darker personality. What he didn't get, he took. He threw himself into reading, books, scrolls, anything he could find to prove he was better. There is a massive lead up to him becoming a dark wizard and then it's as a Death Eater. But little Harry didn't want to be a slave, so he works from within to pull apart the Death Eaters, turning against Voldemort and trying to kill him. However, while he has his fingers in everything, he's starting his own little empire, using Muggles.

I don't want to just post my plot, but he eventually starts a world war, taking over almost the entire world before he's stopped. His goal was to end up being the only magical person, becoming a God in the eyes of Muggles and he succeeded. To wizards, he was the greatest dark lord to ever lived, beating Voldemort, who was alive to witness this, to Muggles, he was a benevolent saviour.

This may not be what you asked for, but there's more to creating a baddie than just a tragic past and blood-purity. You need a build up. What I listed is about 7 books worth. It's a lot, but it stops Harry from becoming powerful overnight. The innate ability is there, but it's not just instant
