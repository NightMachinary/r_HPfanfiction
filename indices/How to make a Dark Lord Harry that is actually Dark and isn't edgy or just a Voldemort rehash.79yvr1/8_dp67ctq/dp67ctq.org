My biggest peeve about Dark Lord Harry is how so many authors tries to make him into a "good" character and try to justify whatever horror he does. "They deserve it, It's justified, I'm right, [x] is not terrible, because [y]" Look. At best it diminish the whole goal of the character if you try to justify his actions and remove the whole 'dark' aspect. It makes everything stale and bland.

A good Dark Lord is, possibly not a villain, but certainly someone that is ready to commit unjustifiable horrors to achieve his goal. A goal that can be acceptable, believable (like the one you have), but the distinction between "Dark Lord" and patriot or revolutionist would certainly be in the actions he does and what he is ready to sacrifice to achieve it.

Think LONG AND HARD how Dark Lord Harry would achieve his goal and, then, think even harder about justifying his actions because he's the MC.
