It would be far easier to write a Dark Lord/Viligante Harry that does a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge][Great Purge]] on the Ministry since they watched how thousands of innocents died under Voldemort and then let his supporters go with a slap on the wrist. So Harry adopts a "if you are not with me you are against me" mentality and sees everyone not oppenly supporting his fight against Voldemort as one of his hidden supporters.

Throw in some Harry/Katie Bell romance and then let the first half of 6th year play out as it did (with Katie nearly dying in Malfoy's plot and no one caring) and then he decides to get shit done on his own. At first, the public supports him since he is THE CHOSEN ONE and the average wizard does not care about Malfoy and his bribes. The ministry wants to arrest him, causing a massive shitstorm and then Harry turns on them ("They try to stop my justice? Well, pureblood supremacists, the whole lot of them"). What started as a righteous crusade turns into a killing spree.
