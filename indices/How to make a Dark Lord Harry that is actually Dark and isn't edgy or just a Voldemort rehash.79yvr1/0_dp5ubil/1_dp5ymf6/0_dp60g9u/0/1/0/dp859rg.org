But, you miss a crucial detail. Nothing says that the magical nations have to follow the same alliance lines as the muggle ones. Magical Russia could fight on the side of the Axis, if they wanted to, and you could justify that with something about how since Stalin took power violently, no one in the previous regime could tell him anything about the magical world, nor did they want to. So magical Russia is not socialist like the USSR. Perhaps they want to fight with the Nazis to bring an end to the Stalin regime. The reason Stalin needs so much aid from his allies, is because Russian wizards just vanish his supplies, or something.
