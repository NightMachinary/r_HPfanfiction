Yeah, I see that now.

I wanted to write a racist Harry, but I guess I basically just made him into a normal Voldemort. I'll have to change some things around, focusing less on the hatred for muggleborns and more on Harry's idea of a strong Wizarding World.

I actually have something similar to an Order 66 situation in mind.
