If you want racist Harry to not be Voldemort 2 then make his attitude more entitlement than hatred. He thinks about muggles the same way he thinks about garden gnomes.

Advocating for muggle rights is like advocating for the rights of pet rocks. It's beyond stupid and why would anything think this is worth time and attention? But these dogs keep barking about it like morons and it's a never ending headache so they've forced my hand just to get them to shut the hell up.
