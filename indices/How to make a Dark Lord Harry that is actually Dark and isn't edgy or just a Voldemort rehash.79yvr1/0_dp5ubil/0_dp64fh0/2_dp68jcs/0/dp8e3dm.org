About to head to work rn, I'll write down what I've got so far.

-Harry's backstory is generally close to canon. No massive beatings or anything super crazy. He learns to look out for Numero Uno.

-He winds up learning a lot from the Dursleys, he sees how the Dursley's never seem to fight each other because they have Harry to belittle, Dudley can get away with pretty much anything because his parents adore him, Dudley basically rules the playground with fear, and how Dudley doesn't really have friends-he has mooks that just follow his lead.

-Harry refuses Draco's offer on the train because he sees that Draco has Crabbe and Goyle; Harry wants his own crew, like Dudley had, so that Harry can be the one in charge for once. He'd rather hedge his bets with Ron as his lackey instead of joining Draco and risking being a follower.

-I might have Harry wind up in Slytherin, in which case Ron will follow him. Ron wants to be different from his brothers, no matter what. Also I'm not gonna sugar coat the shit the Twins pulled on Ron when they were kids what with the spider teddy bear and the attempted unbreakable vow

-Harry never goes after the Stone. Voldemort is trapped in the mirror at the end of First Year. Haven't decided when he eventually escapes, sometime during the last three years.

-Dumbledore notices Harry is acting similar to Tom Riddle. Knowing he has to prevent the emergence of another Voldemort, and with Voldemort luckily locked away, Dumbledore decides that it's safe to let Harry leave the Dursley's. Harry moves in with Lupin where he learns more about his parents, and the unjust legislation against werewolves.

-During second year, Harry actually takes Lockhart's fame tips to heart, and does photo ops and such. This brings him further into the public spotlight, so he meets with important people in the Ministry like Fudge and Umbridge. Harry gets to see the incompetence of the Ministry first hand, thinking "/these/ are the people running the wizarding world?"

-some canon events will happen. The Troll attack occurs, but lol Harry doesn't give two craps about Granger. Hermione lives, but becomes more withdrawn. The other Gryffindors stop being dicks to her.

-Chamber of secrets is still opened. Might make Ginny a Slytherin, Harry uses Tom's diary a bit more. Muggleborn might die. Ministry takes action after the situation is resolved, arrest Ginny despite Dumbledore's and Harry's protests. Further incites Harry's disgust with the Ministry, also raises tensions between muggleborns and purebloods. The Weasley's distance themselves more from Ron.

-Sirius doesn't escape.

-Ever.

Pretty much all the normal canon situations, like Harry being the fourth champion in the TriWizard tournament, or Umbridge coming to Hogwarts don't happen since Voldemort is locked in the mirror.
