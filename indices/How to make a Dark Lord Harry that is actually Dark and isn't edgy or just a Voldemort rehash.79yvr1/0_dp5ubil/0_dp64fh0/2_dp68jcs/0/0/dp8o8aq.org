It looks pretty good, but for the following:

- Get rid of Troll attack on Hermione, especially if Ron ended up in Slytherin. It was a very low probability event that required a series of preceding things to happen.

- If Harry, Ron, and Ginny were all in Slytherin, the Diary plot would be solved after the first attack. IMHO, canon CoS had by far the worst plot because it assumed adults to be utterly incompetent. Please don't fall into that trap.

- If your Voldemort was trapped in the mirror, no one would ever free Barty Jr, and there was NO WAY Harry would enter as the 4th champion. Furthermore, the Barty impersonating Moody plot was ridiculous to begin with because it again assumed an idiot Dumbledore. Also, if Harry didn't burn up Quirrellmort in PS, Voldemort had no way of knowing Harry's protection, and using someone else's blood for his resurrection had much lower risk.
