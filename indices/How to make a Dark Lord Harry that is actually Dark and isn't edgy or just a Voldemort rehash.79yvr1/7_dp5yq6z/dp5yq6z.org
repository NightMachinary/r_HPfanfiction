What I wouldn't give for a Harry that acts like Dr Doom.

Solely believes he can save the Magical World and his way/rule is right. And had the ability to back it up. So I don't know if that's evil Harry or whatever. But it'd be damn cool to read that.

I just don't know how we'd end up there. What event would trigger that response?
