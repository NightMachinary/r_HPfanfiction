Are you thinking that Harry would be an unreliable narrator? That is, like [[/u/cavelioness]] said, a Harry with HPMOR!Harry's attitude but without the author fiat to make him be magically correct every time it matters?

So, he has lots of ideas, all of which have already been considered, tested, and disconfirmed --- something he'd know if he'd spent a few hours in the library; his other theories would be extremely time-consuming and/or dangerous to test, and while he is free to do so so when he's an adult and can cast the relevant spells, no one is obligated to do it for him.

And, what he see as Hermione's lack of thought is just a reflection of the fact that up until the OWLs, all the answers /are/, in fact, in the textbook.
