  I just don't know how we'd end up there. What event would trigger that response?

I would love a fic like that if it doesn't take itself seriously. Imagine this, Harry is smart for his age. His teachers shower him with accolades, he skips grades all over the place. The Dursleys are loving and supportive. Now he gets his Hogwarts' letter. A whole new world to explore. Excitement and stuff. Blah blah blah he's at Hogwarts ravenclaw blah blah bullying Weasley pranks blah blah. The teachers are awful. They refuse to acknowledge his ideas. No, you can't test those theories Harry. That's not what the answer in book gives Harry. Pupils at Hogwarts School must remain in the year they were sorted Harry. Those spells aren't safe for a first year Harry. That book is outlawed everywhere but the DMZ in between Magical Texas and the Aztecs Harry. Meanwhile he sees Hermione constantly rewarded and praised for her repetitive, /arrogant/ *useless* */memorization/*. He gets fed up with Hermione's lack of thought and the whole world's utter incompetence sometime second or third year and snaps. Maybe Lockhart is what finally does it. Maybe it's the dementors.
