Interesting. So. Doom had a tragic past (And here Voldemort acts kinda the same so we're ok there.)

So now Hermione has to show him up in a key class where her memorization ends up being superior and Harry can't reconcile that. So he takes the summer (as opposed to running away from NYU and scarring his face in Tibet) and obsesses over that and blames her.

Like. The its the straw that breaks him. Lockhart. The education process. Dementors. Maybe the Tri Wizard.

Wait. It would need to be After HBP that this occurs.

He'd find a kindred spirit in the HBP and hoard it and learn from it, drink it in. End of year happens and Hermione shows him up even after all the HBP book helps. Summer to concoct his plan and let the world now to his whim.
