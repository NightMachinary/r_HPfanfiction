  He'd find a kindred spirit in the HBP and hoard it and learn from it, drink it in. End of year happens and Hermione shows him up even after all the HBP book helps. Summer to concoct his plan and let the world now to his whim.

That would make a lot of sense. Have a snippet.

*Background:* Harry, Ron, and Hermione never became friends. Ron and Hermione are both in Gryffindor, but they aren't really on each other's radars. Hermione doesn't have very close friends, but she's friendly with some older students (starting with Percy) and some Hufflepuffs. Harry and Hermione have a sort of a one-sided rivalry, as described upthread.

Harry has finally managed to start beating Hermione in Potions due to the HBP's textbook. She somehow learned of it, and so she went to Slughorn to report Harry for what she sees as cheating. Which brings us to...

*Horace Slughorn and the Socratic Method*

"Thank you for your report, Miss Granger; I've been wondering myself why Mister Potter has been outperforming everyone by such a margin. Is there anything else?"

"May I ask what will happen?"

"If you are asking what I intend to do, Miss Granger, the answer is nothing, at this point."

"But Professor, isn't that unfair to the rest of us?"

Hermione saw Slughorn's normally jovial demeanour dissipate, as he perused her for a few long seconds, before relenting.

"Miss Granger, I try to be friendly, and easygoing, but that does not give you license to question my disciplinary decisions. However, as I seem to have a weakness for inquisitive Muggleborn Gryffindors, perhaps I will explain myself. Come, sit."

Hermione complied.

"Miss Granger, have you heard the saying 'Never do any enemy a small injury'?"

Hermione searched her memory. "Niccolo Machiavelli, /The Prince/, right?"

Slughorn raised an eyebrow. "Salazar Slytherin. Anyway, consider how it applies to the present situation."

"You... think that punishing him would give him a grudge against you, and whatever punishment you could administer would not weaken his ability to retaliate."

"Indeed. I try not to have any more enemies than I absolutely have to; but in Mister Potter's case, I don't think he'll really understand why he is being punished, is known to be particularly vindictive, and his name as the Boy-Who-Lived still caries weight for some powerful people."

"If I may," Hermione hesitated, before deciding to press ahead with the question, "does that mean that Harry will get away with cheating because he is vindictive?"

"I never said that, Miss Granger. Actions have consequences. Consider which outcomes Mister Potter attains by cheating, and how those relate to outcomes that matter in the long run."

Hermione thought out loud. "Harry is getting better marks, and he is getting praised for how smart he is... But only for this year, and NEWT is the only mark that matters in the long run... And he isn't understanding things any better, just learning some tips for specific potions."

"So you see, Miss Granger, I don't need to punish Harry, because Harry will punish himself. In my experience, Gryffindors tend think in principles, whereas Slytherins tend to think in consequences. Each could stand to learn from the other."

"But why do you encourage him? It seems... manipulative."

"I encourage all my NEWT students to experiment, Miss Granger. In fact, I've been a bit surprised about how timid you've been this year."

Hermione thought back to the classes, how there either wasn't quite enough time to finish the potion, or missing ingredients... "If we had gone off-recipe in Professor Snape's class, he'd have used a Permanent Sticking Charm to glue our hands together," she remarked. "But, this is NEWT-level?"

Slughorn nodded. "Now, how do you think was Mister Potter able to brew Amortentia in the allotted time?"

Hermione frowned. "He probably used the book. I hadn't been watching him just then."

"Certainly, but what do you think the book might have told him to do?"

With a concrete problem to solve, things were simpler. Mentally went over that lesson, thinking out loud. "Well, /I/ got held up cutting the Sopophorous Bean, but you couldn't prepare it in advance, since the juice evaporates too quickly... But you just need to get at the juice, so you can just squeeze it out... But wouldn't crushing it... Unless you crushed it with a pestle made of a noble metal, maybe?

"OK, but juice without pulp would make the reaction too fast. What if you stir it slower? No, too subjective: it couldn't have been an instruction in the book. Lower the temperature? But that would weaken the potion. OK, how about the reverse stirring trick? You'd have to do it once every... Three... No, you don't want to slow it down all the way; seven for balance. Or is it every six for a cycle of seven? No, you want them to partially counteract each other. So, one clockwise stir for every seven anticlockwise?" She resumed eye contact with Slughorn, who had been nodding along.

"That may well work, Miss Granger. A potion recipe you see in a book is a delicate balance, trading off safety, potency, simplicity, economy of ingredients, and economy of time against each other. There is usually a straightforward way to improve on any one of these characteristics, but it almost always comes with a cost in terms of the others. A lot of what a potioneer does is compensate for the undesirable side-effects of the modifications made to produced the desired effects.

"Any other matters you would like to discuss?"

"No, thank you, sir. I'll try to do better in the future."

"Always happy to help an interested student. Oh, and Miss Granger... You are one of those fortunate people for whom hard work is its own reward, but how about a little extra incentive? As it happens, I do have another philtre of Felix Felicis. Beat Mister Potter's Potions marks for the remainder of the year, and it's yours. I'm sure you could find an interesting use for it."

--------------

I don't think Slughorn is too OOC. One way to look at it is that we only see his interactions with Harry, and those are laden with guilt over Tom Riddle and fear that Harry might follow in his footsteps, so he deflects with his bumbling, jovial persona. Around someone like Hermione --- an eager, intelligent student --- he might be more clear-headed and professorial.
