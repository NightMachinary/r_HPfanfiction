  Dark Magic is horribly addictive, and changes the user to use Dark Magic more often

I've seen that a few times. You have to be careful with it so it's not debilitating -- your protagonist has to be a Lord and attract followers.

Voldemort is all about tearing down the Ministry, infiltrating it, and consuming it from the inside. You could make your Dark Lord's faction be about building up, offering an alternative to the Ministry's way. One that brings him in quick and direct conflict with the Ministry, though they'd probably have to make the first move.

Voldemort is sadistic and cruel, cackling in delight over torturing Muggles. Harry might instead be cold and callous, destroying whole towns because they were in the way.

I would suggest changing their goals, though. You're giving them a lot of similarities; the more differences you can add, the better. For instance, maybe Harry's goal is to steal away all the Muggleborns, incorporate them into society fully, have them as a solid backbone of society. This contrasts with Voldemort's goal of eradicating them or stuffing them into an underclass. Whatever it is, make sure there's something compelling about it.
