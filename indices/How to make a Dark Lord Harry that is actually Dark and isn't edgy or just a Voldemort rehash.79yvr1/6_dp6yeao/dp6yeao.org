There is one element that is key to a good villain story-corruption. How the character goes from being a random nobody to a major villain rarely starts with them waking up one morning with a suddenly good evil laugh and ridiculous schemes.

Riddle's a good example of this-he starts out just stealing objects and scaring kids. Over the course of six/seven years, he manages to build himself up to committing murder in the name of his own immortality. And 25 years later, when he bursts onto the scene, he's batshit insane.

From A to B to C, you see the gradual escalation occurring. Riddle didn't start out as an insane supervillain. He was a sadist, yes, but so are a lot of other kids Riddle's age (though not to the degree he took it, bullies are unforunately common). Being sadistic didn't make him a murderer. Being a sociopath didn't make him a villain.

It wasn't his nature that turned Tom Riddle into Voldemort. What made Riddle Voldemort was the choices he made. And the choices he made were influenced by the environments and circumstances he was exposed to.

It's easy to forget that he was in London during World War 2. He was likely there during the Blitz and the Battle of Britain, which meant that he experienced rationing, bombing attacks and much more firsthand.

It's also easy to forget that Riddle did, at some point, make his way to Albania to recover Ravenclaw's diadem. He most probably did such a thing during a time when Albania was better known as the People's Socialist Republic of Albania and part of the communist bloc.

Which meant that he would have probably travelled across post-war Eastern Europe to get there. Thing was that Eastern Europe continued being a merry little slice of Hell for a long time after Berlin fell, given that the communists turned out to be just as bloodthirsty as the Nazis in the end.

What I think happened is that Riddle's innate paranoia and disregard of others certainly motivated him, but it was the events he witnessed that pushed him over the edge. Those would have definitely played a part in his fall and the rise of Voldemort.

Dark Lords are all about the journey. Getting Harry Potter to become a Dark Lord requires a gradual slide over time-a little willingness to inflict pain here, a desire for more advanced magical abilities there, add a little motivation and voila!

You can play canon events that way. Harry being a little more traumatized, scared, angry and willing to play fast & loose with some of the more dangerous magics around in order to better protect himself would, if obeying the stations of canon, naturally lead to a vastly darker mindset come the middle of book five.

Being tortured for months on end with nobody but his friends willing to step in to help him very nearly pushes Harry over the edge in canon-and definitely marks the point where Hermione goes 'fuck it, I'll just lure the Toad into a centaur den and let them figure out what to do with the bitch', which has all kinds of 'fun' implications thanks to Greek mythology.

I found the part where she hung around the hospital wing to bang coconuts together out of Umbridge's sight to be satisfyingly sadistic too.

But yeah, Harry. You can have him playing by much more violent and murderhappy rules by book seven if you simply allow corruption to actually be a thing he's susceptible to.

I swear, with the amount of shit he's seen, violent insanity is a more than plausible outcome.
