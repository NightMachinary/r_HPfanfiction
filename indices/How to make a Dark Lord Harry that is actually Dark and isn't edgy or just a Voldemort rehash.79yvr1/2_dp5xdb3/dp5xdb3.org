The title of a Dark Lord is given too freely in HP fanfic in my opinion. That title should be given to those who are willing to sacrifice EVERYTHING to their own ends. There is a difference between Dark lord and a Dark wizard.

Do you plan to make him dark only in his views about a society or will he train and use dark magic ? I have yet to read a good story where Harry is actually training and using dark magics likes of blood magic, soul magic etc. You should also make a balance between magic and politics.

Will he have a teacher ? Or will he be just a lone wolf, trying and studying just by himself ?

You should ask yourself if you're going for Chaotic Evil likes of Voldemort or more Neutral Evil like Darth Sidious was.

What will be his goal ? Domination ? A new order ? Power only for himself ? Will he care about consequences or just kill everyone who stands in his way without a second thought ? Or will he be manipulative and fight only when he's completely assured of his victory ?

There shouldn't be any relationships purely out of love. Passion, lust, desire, greed is the way.

These are just a few questions you should ask yourself if you're going to write Dark Lord Potter story. Your summed up Dark Harry who is like a second Voldemort.

Also you shouldn't make him super-powerful 11 years old. There should be some build up, trails and errors etc.
