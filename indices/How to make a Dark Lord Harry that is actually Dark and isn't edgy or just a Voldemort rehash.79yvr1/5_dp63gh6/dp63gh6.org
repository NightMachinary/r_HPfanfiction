Harry as a true dark lord would be more in line with B/W than Voldemort's B/R. This is using the magic color wheel, where black is selfish and self interested and is willing to attain power by any means (which is sort of a prerequisite for a dark lord). Red is a passionate color that rides high on emotions. It loves destruction, often so that what is left behind can be used to create something new. White on the other hand favors order, puts the good of the many over that of the individual, and often is more reactive in nature.

Voldemort was very much B/R, also known as Rakdos. The cult of Rakdos is a hedonistic group that is in favor of gaining power by inflicting pain, spreading madness, and forcing all to bow to their dark master or be sacrificed. Voldemort is a very passionate and highly selfish individual who enjoys inflicting pain on others, often simply because he derives pleasure from it. Voldemort has no interest in anything greater than his own power. He leaves no lasting memorials, has no true cause of his own, and really is in it just to reign supreme over all while taking delight in the suffering of his foes.

Harry's difference would be that he would be very interested in maintaining some sort of order, especially to protect his friends and family. He would acquire power not inflict harm or destroy, but to protect and build. Where Voldemort would burn the world just to watch, Harry would try to freeze everything in perfect stasis. He wouldn't hesitate to destroy his enemies, but he would wait for just cause. Harry going down the Dark Path wouldn't be for his own gain: he would likely lose someone close to him (Ginny or Ron would be the best candidates) and go on the warpath with the rallying cry of "Never Again!"
