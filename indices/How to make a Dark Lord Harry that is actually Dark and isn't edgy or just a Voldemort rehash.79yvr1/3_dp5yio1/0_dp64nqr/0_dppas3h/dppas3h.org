Have you read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8615605/1/][The Never-ending Road]] by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/3117309/][Iaventadorn]]? Plot aside, the way the author describes Dark Magic is pretty interesting. You get a magical backlash proportionate to power of the spell/ritual, which causes mild/immense pain for seconds to weeks. The pull of Dark Magic is how much more powerful they are, even at the lowest. The backlash isn't immediate either. It seems to kick in a few hours later.

For example, a locating spell that tells you precisely where someone is, and gives apparation coordinates is on the low-level to middling side of Dark Magic, causing what amounts to muscle cramps and a headache for an hour or so. Pretty damn powerful if you ask me.

If you use the same spell, but it also binds the target in place (until you choose to release them), will give a much worse backlash that lasts a day or so.

The limiter is pain, so most sane practicioners don't try the more powerful spells. Being an occlumens helps immensely with it, or having undergone rituals to alter how your brain reacts to pain (also risky). Bellatrix was a certified masochist, which explains her position and reputation.

Only throwing it out there. I'm not a fan of simple explanations on either side of the coin. If the only thing bad about Dark Magic is the legality and addiction, it makes it seem like heroin, and that's kinda boring.

Nobody wants to read about someone shooting up all the time either. It gets tiring after the first few descriptions. It was kind of my only problem with the Denarian Renegade series, tbh.

I'm really digging your concept though. I've never read a Dark Lord Potter that I really enjoyed. They're in the 'WWE' category for me as far as entertainment goes. Not a bad thing, mind, just campy and a bit ridiculous.
