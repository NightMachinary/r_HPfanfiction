This sounds horribly uninteresting (to me, ymmv).

  Dark Magic is horribly addictive, and changes the user to use Dark Magic more often...

An interesting story should have interesting choices. An interesting protagonist should make dark choices because of character flaws, untenable situations, lack of options, etc., not because they're simply /addicted/ (i.e., I exagerate, but: /mindlessly/ addicted).

[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/][Worm]] is probably a good example of a "good" character making dark choices. She starts off wanting to be a hero, but gets sucked into being a villain because the authorities are so messed up she finds (or at least feels) she can do more good as a villain than as a hero (and other reasons).

The Harry Potter verse could easily be a similar setting with an inept/corrupt Ministry where becoming a "Dark Lord" is (as Harry sees it, because Dumbledore was a failure) the only real way to effect change (which doesn't necessarily mean Voldemort was a good guy -- you don't need two good Dark Lords in your story), even if that means truly resorting to actual dark magic. Harry becoming a Dark Lord to help muggleborns/werewolves/etc., opposed by the Ministry, opposed by Voldemort, /and/ opposed by Hermione who is also fighting for muggleborns/werewolves/etc. but denounces his methods? That could be interesting.

  He sees muggles as savages, but ultimately weak. ... he only means his own freedom ... (his mother) is descended from...Salazar Syltherin

That's, you know ... Voldemort. We've already seen that character.
