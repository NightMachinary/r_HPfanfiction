I think it depends whether you want to maintain as much as possible the 'canon' of Harry as a character. I don't think he can be pushed to a limit where he would discard human life if it furthered his goals. He finds it difficult enough that others sacrifice themselves to save him. That's why I think the 'Dark Lord Harry' idea is too much. However, if you don't have any canon-like aspirations, you could make this realistic. I would recommend not having him hate Muggleborns. But perhaps go for the 'precious magic' angle where he becomes so enamoured with magic itself that he will do much to protect it. That way he will also see Purebloods as noble protectors of the old magical world.

Personally, I am trying to figure out how to spoil our lovely hero, exploit his 'grey' side, while staying as close to the 'canon' Harry as possible. I think linkffn(4745329) is one of the few who pulled that off convincingly. (Which is why I'm aching for an update. I recently reread that one even though I knew I shouldn't. The author says it is not abandoned but still, it might take ages...) And I felt so alive from it! Because it nails the character so precisely while at the same time confronting Harry with a moral slippery slope. I find that the most exhilarating thing fanfiction can offer.
