Thanks.

I think there's a lot of potential in crossing over these two universes, but it seems like a lot of the Harry Potter/Marvel stuff I've found is him turning out to be the son of Thor or Loki, and its just the usual Ultra-Awesome Harry power fantasy. And hey, I've got a soft spot for the Son of Coul, and think he'd make a good dad (at least in so far as his responsibilities with SHIELD allowed him to be).
