I think people like to play fast and loose and manufacture reasons for canon Harry to be different from what he really was. Canon Harry was on decent terms with */Malfoy/* of all people at the 19 year epilogue, giving each other nods of respect and all that.

If canon Harry can be so forgiving to someone who was as much of an ass to him as Draco Malfoy was through all their school years, then what makes people think that canon Harry is going to suddenly hate all his loved ones who are back from the dead just because they are a bit different from his original universe? He's going to at least try to reconnect with them.

I see that kind of thing a lot with authors that don't like certain characters who they want to bash, like for example Hermione. Yes, she's bossy and not exactly a smooth social person when she's younger, but if you think that canon Harry is going to go back to a time when they were kids and suddenly loose all patience with her and hate her because she's not perfect, then you have forgotten what canon Harry is like, or just don't care because it's fun to bash.

And oh is it so fun to bash! lol

But I like the one story from Dogbertcarroll "A MODern man" where Harry ends up in a nice universe over in his younger analog's body. He's got a family and he's loving it!
