I don't honestly get why Sirius gets so much hate for not securing Harry. He gave him to Hagrid didn't he? And Hagrid even without a wand can defend himself. Plus he knew more people were right on the way. In those circumstances how can anyone dislike a man who is chasing his best friend and his wife's betrayer?
