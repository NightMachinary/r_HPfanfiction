I quite enjoy the POU trilogy even though it's unfinished and I can see how it can drag on it parts for some. I started reading while part three was already started so that might have helped with the slowness in my perspective. I do know she eventually did end up posting a summary of what she intended to happen with the fic even though it was never finished. I would still recommend that particular story to a new H/Hr reader even though it's extremely AU by now.

The only other BIG fic I can think of being a must read at the time is Trouble in Paradise, an H/Hr fic from the perspective of Angelina Johnson married to one of the Weasley Twins and Hermione with Ron. I do remember enjoying it at the time and might have to seek it out for a second read for perspective. I have to find it though. It might be lost in a Yahoo Group somewhere.

My very first forays into fanfic was [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1430023/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Acceptance-of-Fate][Acceptance of Fate]]. I don't know if it was very popular but I enjoyed it even though it remained unfinished after HPB was released and she stopped writing it. It was my gateway drug into the world of fanfic.

Oh how I enjoyed all the endless H/Hr vs R/HR debate during the lapse between OOTP and HBP. Such great times. I knew deep down my preference wouldn't end up canon but the debating back and forth on silly Yahoo Groups was still amazing all the same!
