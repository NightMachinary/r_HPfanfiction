I didn't start reading fanfic until after OOTP but what about [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra_Clare][Cassandra Clare]]?

When I first started reading fic that was the must read story I was directed to. I've actually never been a big fan of that particular series, even though I do like H/Hr. But she's managed to catapult that into a successful career where her original work is now being made into major motion pictures themselves. Not sure if this is relevant but as a reader of H/Hr fic when I first started looking she and [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/lori/TPOU.html][Lori]] where huge must reads in that particular community.

I actually only read the first two of her trilogy so I have no idea if H/Hr even ended up as the ship endgame of the trilogy.
