Yes, she was Cassandra Claire then, with the "i." She only changed the name when she got her book deal. She's the BNF that I still remember. Even now, I think the concept for Draco Dormiens (the first book) is great--I love the first few chapters. I don't remember whether I felt equally enthusiastic for the rest of that book, but I did begin to find the CC obsession puzzling, because I found the sequels to be overwrought.

I also found it rather awkward that someone who plagiarized so much got a book deal out of her fandom fame, which is why I call liking the memory of DD a "guilty pleasure."
