I actually only found out about the plagiarism issue last year despite reading the trilogy when it was still being published (I think I discovered it halfway through /Draco Veritas/ being posted). I reread the trilogy for the first time since it'd been finished and realised I didn't enjoy it half as much as I remembered. I did have to push myself to actually finish DV because it just dragged on so much. But I was quite shocked to learn about the plagiarism thing and it certainly stole what little enjoyment I still got from the trilogy, and made me a lot more sceptical about her published works (of which I've only read one and didn't enjoy it much - certainly not enough to read any more of her stuff).
