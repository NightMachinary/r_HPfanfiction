Okay, thanks for that. I thought I had imagined the I in Claire after I searched for her profile. It's been a long while since I even thought about that story that I thought I'd remembered her handle wrong.

Also as a huge fan of Buffy I can't even remember if I picked up on the plagiarism at the time or not. I'd like to think I did but all I know is I only read through once and wasn't really impressed with it. Unfortunately I think this happens more often than nought. I know there was a One Tree Hill fanfic I was really enjoying that started to completely blatantly rip off Gilmore Girls dialogue and there is a currrent H/HR fic on FF.net that is a complete rip off of several plots from Lost's first season. The main plot I think is original but all back stories are based on Lost.
