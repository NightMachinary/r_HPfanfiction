I wonder how readers new to fan fiction can handle changes authors make. I started reading fanfics probably in 2003-2004, and it was just an entirely different mindset going into them. How did Voldemort have his powers? How would Harry defeat him? And of course who would end up together (for the more romantic centric ones) were the big questions writers were trying to answer. Nowadays I just read Methods of Rationality because it is such a fun/interesting twist so it has that same feeling the older ones did. To those who started reading fan fiction after all the books finished try to go into a story with an open mind or else you'll probably have a bad time.
