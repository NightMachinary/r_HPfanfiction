I think the path Rowling took with the Horcruxes was very cool, but fanfiction writers have the freedom to really develop characters and their plot.

With that said, a few ideas really stood out to me which weren't really focused on/used. One fanfiction focused on the fact that Harry can sometimes see what Voldemort is up to and had him slowly "lose himself" the more it happened. An idea that I liked (fanfic was never complete or anything) was Harry becoming an animagus (black panther) to hide between 6th and 7th year.

A few I read had actual training for the war. I can't really blame Rowling for this but if you think about the spells the gang use for combat are limited. So a few that stand out to me (although not enough to remember by name) are the ones where year 6 they don't go to school so they can train with the Order OR for the ones that they do attend Hogwarts turns into a military base where everyone is trained for the war.

Overall I can say I never read any that were TOO crazy (and if I did they were funny romance ones written for that purpose) but like you said there weren't any that came close to "getting it right" either. Like you, I read fanfics for other stories (mostly anime) so I think that helped open me up to AU stuff.

Oh just remembered one that might take the cake for weird just because of what led up to me reading it. For those of you that are fanfic junkies there is one for EVERY couple. So one night I was joking around with my friends about the different odd pairings and searching them, and of course we were finding some. So then I had to do it and searched to see if there were any Harry/Hedwig ones and there was one. No he didn't get freaky deaky with his owl, but basically what happened was Hedwig was set free because being with him was too dangerous (perfectly normal)... but then Harry starts to cry and confess his love for her and that no one will understand him the way she did. So it may not be super weird, but it felt extra weird/funny because I went into it with the mentality "Holy crap there is actually a fanfic about Harry getting with his owl."
