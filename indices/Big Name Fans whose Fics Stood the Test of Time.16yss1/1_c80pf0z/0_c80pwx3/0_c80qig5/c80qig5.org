True, I hadn't even read all the books or seen the films when I started reading HP fan fictions. I kinda fell into it from another fan verse. So it was really interesting because I hadn't a clue what was real or what came from where. It was kinda disappointing in a sense when I read all the books and started watching the films properly because everything I'd read up till then had been so off the wall. Basically no fanfiction writer killed everyone off either.I was in shock when that happened to say the least.but it did spark a Renaissance of sorts with all the /la la la that never happened/ fics that came afterwards to rewrite history ;)

Same thing has happened to me with other genres too. Read a torchwoodXharry potter fic once cause I liked the author and BOOM! I ended up obsessed with doctor who. Bit odd, but there are worse ways to get into something.

I've often wondered why more hp fanfiction obsessives aren't on here. deviantart is full of them but I dont like mixing my art page with fanverse stuff because I use it professionally. So I just lurk most of the time there.

What's the craziest story you've read from back in the day that took what might happen to it's weirdest end? Or what story almost got it right? I can think of none of the latter, but I'll think about the weirdest one for a while. God knows there's some competition for that title!
