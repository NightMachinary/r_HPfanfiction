ohla,

I've been reading fanfiction for about 8 years or so, (i'm 28)

The oldest authors I can think of that I still re-read now and then and seem to still be getting reviews are:

1) [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/140916/Leila-B][Leila B]] posted in *2002*

2) [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/426171/Caeria][Caeria]] posted in *2005* still writing it, and still gets a /lot/ of reviews.

3) [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/425332/Disneydoll0424][Disneydoll424]] posted in *2003* still getting reviews.

4) [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/866426/][Children of the Shadows]] *2006* still writing, still very popular.

--------------

There are others that came out around 2007/8 but I don't know how far back you're thinking? I know stories that are very popular and authors who are very popular who only started in around 2010ish? Althoug when I say popular, they're not up in the thousands of reviews yet most of them I don't think. Although [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1632752/Anubis-Ankh][Anubis Ankh]] is quite new and they have over 1600 reviews for [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7453087/1/Pride-of-Time][Pride of Time]] which only came out in 2011.

The most impressive I have to say is Caeria, she's spent /years/ writing her story and people are still lapping it up.

I guess it depends on what you're looking for. A lot of the fiction pairings I've been interested in lately have been few and far between, so i'll read almost anything that comes out relating to it not basing it on reviews at all. /But/ the more popular pairings while there are lots of stories involving them which have thousands of reviews do tend to get read more in general anyway. I'm in the process of writing myself, but have yet to publish, i'm hoping I can ask some of the more popular authors I get on with to plug me a bit perhaps. but I don't imagine, even if the story is good, that'll get many reviews till it's been up for the lenght of time as the oldies.

I loved it when stories came out before you knew what way rowling was going to take the books. they were always so interesting and no one resented the weird directions authors tooks the stories in, which they seem to now. I personally love reading stories where X never happened, or Y never died or when it turns out some random character has some mental super power. It's reached the point where i've read the same story so many times. told so many different ways that when people do change something I can still imagine it being perfectly feasible.

Would love to hear your own thoughts fleshed out a bit.

Does it ever freak you out when you relise an author you like is wasn't born till you were ten? When they're called 'something93' and things it freaks me out... But I wasn't really a child when the books came out, so what did I expect I guess.
