We started reading around the same time. Betwen GoF and OoTP.

I still recall the big splash Severitus made and that genre still goes on (Severus as Harry's dad, the username is the term for this) even though that users story never finished.

I saw someone post about Anubis...OMG that writer makes some crazy crazy mammoth stories! I've read over 1million words of his/her stories. I wanna say her, but forget.

I used to read a lot of Notwolf, some time ago. That name rings a bell.

I posted this in another thread, but Sugar Quill, from the site, the Sugar Quill did After The End, and that will always be a classic to me.

Dunno how long coffeeonthepatio has been around, but she writes quite a bit, and some great work too.

Star Polaris is an older user too, but sadly, abandoned a story I was reading (nearly 5 years ago. Still waiting. lol), but is still actively writing.

These are all ff.net usernames, BTW.

I dont recall any others, and aside from the crazy huge writers, like Anubis, I dont tend to recall/keep track of usernames, because I read so much, and the community is so huge now.

I find now, you dont find as many stories via word of mouth/user as you used to. It's a very search and read world. It's great that there are so many options. I used to run out of DECENT Time travel stories to read, and now they are nearly endless (though I do try).

For anyone who want to find older stories, look up ff.net's C2 communities and look for that sort of specific group. It can be a great way of discovering stories. And you dont realize how dated they are until you re-read them.

Ok...enough insanity from me. PM me if any of this is unclear. It's 1am and I'm tired, and busy reading fanfiction, of course!
