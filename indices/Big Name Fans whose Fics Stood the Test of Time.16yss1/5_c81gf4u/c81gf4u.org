There was a really great Maruaders era fic called "Match" on harrypotterfanfiction.com. Now, they have a policy that after a year of no activity, they take your stuff off their servers/site. It had gotten to about 49 chapters and it was amazing. It was a big name/big story on that site, so when I saw that the author hadn't been around and that the story was taken down, my heart broke.

There was a very tomboyish seventh year girl named Ze, who played beater on the Gryffindor quidditch team and her relationships with her teammates and her /new/ relationships with her dormmates. The guys on the quidditch team decide to stay celibate until the last game, with consequences if they don't. One of the girls in the seventh year named Gwen (if I recall correctly), is manipulating too many people (she's been cast the ice queen who reigns with an iron fist), so the other girls in the dorm plot to take her down. When the last chapter had come out, Lily and James had switched bodies. Ze was seen beating up her best friend's girlfriend. Think this was after the Ravenclaw/Gryffindor match.

The chapters were usually 4000 words. It seemed like it had a slow moving plot but three chapters later, you wonder how everything got there. Such an addictive read.
