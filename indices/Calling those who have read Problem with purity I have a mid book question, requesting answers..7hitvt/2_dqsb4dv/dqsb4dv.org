I think you're going to have to accept that this author believes that if you 'love' someone then you will keep loving them no matter what they do to you (or your friends) , because tbh with some of the shit Snape pulls in this fic I would be totally in favour of Hermione chopping him up for potions ingredients.

This is not an opinion I agree with. There has to be some point where you say that 'this is enough. I don't have to put up with this' and leave, because if they pull that kind of shit at the beginning of the relationship and you allow it, you're setting yourself up for disaster.

However, those caveats mostly apply to the sshg ship in this fic. At the point you're at, Draco has only really done this one thing, and I think Harry may understand the pressures Draco was operating under (I think there was something about unforgivables setting off the wards and using one may have been a conscious choice to summon help and cut the encounter as short as possible, while still doing what needs to be done). I also believe Harry and Hermione have a discussion about that very subject, but you may mot have gotten that far yet.

So look, I don't want to write any specific spoilers, but... If you're having a problem accepting this bit you might want to reconsider reading this fic because honestly, it gets much much worse (not between Harry and Draco though).
