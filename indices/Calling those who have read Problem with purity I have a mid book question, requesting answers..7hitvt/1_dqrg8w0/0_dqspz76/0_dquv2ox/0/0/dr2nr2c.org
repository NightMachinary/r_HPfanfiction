Okay so my favourite trope of all time is the 'secret occlumency lessons' one, which basically says that Snape was giving Hermione occlumency lessons through sixth year and that's when a relationship started to develop. It's brilliant on a number of levels - some fics have Snape helping Hermione with her parents, which fills in the plot crater of Hermione modifying her parents' memories but later saying she's never cast the memory modification spell, and they mostly fit beautifully into canon.

Linkffn(Angels to Fly by Slytherpouf) is my current favourite. It has a beautifully done spiky-yet-vulnerable Snape, but then all of Slytherpouf's Snapes are beautifully done.

Linkffn(Phoenix Song or, Hermione Granger and the H B P by Grangerous) is beautifully done also. Its the first in a trilogy and is the very slowest of slow burns, and I love it.

Linkffn(Camerado by Milliejoan) is also magnificent. The author has promised an epilogue, but the story is complete without it so don't worry.

Linkffn(The Professor's Discretion by TwelveYearsInAzkaban) is absolutely stunning. It goes a bit off the canon rails in seventh year and there's no romance as such, just this beautiful sense of emotional intimacy that builds throughout the story.

I'll be back later with some of my favourite other fics :D
