SCP is a website where there are fake "monsters" catalogued. I use the term monsters /very/ loosely because not everything mentioned is an actual sentient being (at least not observably sentient).

If i remember correctly, Control took a lot of inspiration from it. Many of the altered items have odd backstories and files detailing their behavior attached to them in the same way that the SCPs do. These files even have a lot of blacked out sections in the same way SCPs have redacted sections. And the FBC itself is basically the game's version of the SPC foundation. The biggest difference that I could observe was the SCPs can sometimes be visibly sentient and organic life (sometimes resembling monsters or demons) while Control's altered items are exclusively supernatural objects.
