Using owls as messengers were one of the things I found quirky in Harry Potter when I was a kid. I loved it. I don't think I would have been interested if the wizards used pigeons or falcons.

However, I do recognize that I too wondered how owls delivered letters and parcels. I think it was written that these were tied to their legs but I remember some illustrations of owls carrying things on their beaks.

Anyway, I always liked to think that post owls weren't ordinary owls. They were especially bred to have special attributes (fly faster? sense & go through magical wormholes?) and went to "owl school." Pigwidgeon is an obvious anomaly but maybe he was a "reject" of the school and turned loose when he didn't make the cut. Come to think of it, the Weasley family owl, Errol, may have been an almost-reject, so it's not only his age that makes him unreliable.
