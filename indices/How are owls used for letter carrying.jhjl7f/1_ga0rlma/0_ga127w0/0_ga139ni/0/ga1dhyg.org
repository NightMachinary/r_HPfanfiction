Sure. I was curious myself and had looked it up before. It doesn't really appear as an obvious or natural choice, using owls as a postal service.

And indeed there are some interesting ideas! Though I have seen the owl egg curing alcoholism one in a fic once - Harry got drunk and Poppy crushed an owl egg on his forehead to sober him up. Drew out the alcohol through his pores and then she set it on fire to burn it off. It did burn like nitrocellulose, so he didn't lose his eyebrows, but it wasn't a cure I expected to read ever.

I really need to find that fic again. :D
