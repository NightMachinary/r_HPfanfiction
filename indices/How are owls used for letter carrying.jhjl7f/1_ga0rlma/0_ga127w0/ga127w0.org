That's basically it. Owls are associated with Wisdom and 'Magic' in a natural sense rather than a man-made sense. They're not familiars, just omens and symbols. Also, JK thought they were cool. From the HP Lexicon:

Q: Why did you choose the owl as the animal messenger in your books? A. Because owls are traditionally associated with magic, and I like them. -- J.K. Rowling (Sch2)
