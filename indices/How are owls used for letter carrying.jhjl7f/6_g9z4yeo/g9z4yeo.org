I used the distance from London to the Scottish highlands of 430 miles. I divided by 30 MPH to get 14 hours. What values did you use?

The best actual postal service for mail in the UK, I found, only guarantees 1 day delivery. So owls seem perfectly fine for delivering mail. If it's truly urgent, one can floo, apparate, portkey, or send a patronus. And they clearly do work as an effective form of communication, given that we see wizards communicating just fine with owls.

Additionally, owls have an innate magical nature that allows them to track people. I wouldn't be surprised if that same nature conferred advantages with speed of flight.
