Inverness, on Scotland's northeastern shoreline, is about 567 miles from London. Assuming you use a Great Horned Owl, which is considered the fastest at a top speed of 40 mph, you get a rough travel time of about 14 hours. However, that doesn't take into account any weather conditions or the stamina of the owl, so I added on a bit more, since a predatorial bird like an owl isn't going to maintain top speed that long.

I hadn't thought to compare it to the Muggle system. I suppose you have a point there.
