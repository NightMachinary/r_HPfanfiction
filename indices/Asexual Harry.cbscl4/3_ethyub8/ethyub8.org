Growing up and discovering his sexuality is a part of my fic linkffn(We, Harry Potter). Harry gets his personality split into five pieces, and three of them just don't care about the physical aspects of relationships at all (with one of them also being aromantic as well). The other two are just concentrated bundles of horny that have no idea what to do with the realization that "girls aren't yucky anymore" --- as he's only thirteen and is currently in the midst of the trainwreck that is puberty.

I have no plans to put him in any relationship, and as he's currently figuring things out, his five heads won't be able to agree on having a relationship with anyone at all for a long time.
