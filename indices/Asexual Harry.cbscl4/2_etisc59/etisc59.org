The Coiners' Paper Trail has an asexual Harry, but it's also slash, specifically Harry/Snape. Linkffn(7042124)

On ao3 you can also filter for fics with an asexual tag.

But it seems you get better results by filtering for more generic tags, ie 'Asexual Character' or 'Asexuality'. Of course, I can't attest to the quality of these fics.
