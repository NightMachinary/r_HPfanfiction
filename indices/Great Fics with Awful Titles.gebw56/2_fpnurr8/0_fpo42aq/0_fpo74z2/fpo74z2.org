It's not perfect, but it is really high quality. And I still can't comprehend how the author put out that much /polished/ content, that quickly - three million words in a hair over a year? Crazy.

I only really have two complaints. First, the author should have pruned some content. Yes, the characterization is great, and all of Harry's allies having their own, unique approaches to magical combat is nice, but... When they each need to have a page or two dedicated to their viewpoint in the major battles, it makes a few minutes of fighting just drag on for ages. Second, I'm just not a fan of romance in fanfiction, regardless of the pairing, so in later years the Harry/Draco romance scenes just take me out of it, and I start skimming until it's over. It's well written, but it's just not for me.

It has some amazing moments, though. The Harry/Voldemort fights are some of the most epic I've seen in the fandom. Dumbledore's thing with the Light griffon (trying not to spoil with details). And many more.
