[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]] is just a terrible title, at least to me. The summary doesn't help, either:

#+begin_quote
  *Summary:* AU, eventual HP/DM slash, (very) Slytherin!Harry. Harry's brother Connor is the Boy-Who-Lived, and Harry has devoted himself to protecting him---by being ordinary. But certain people aren't content to let Harry hide in the shadows.

It sounds like some awful, Gary Stu self-insert who everyone, including Harry, is going to be annoyingly devoted to. Instead, it's the first part of a ridiculously long and detailed story with fantastic worldbuilding and one of the few OP!Harry's I really enjoy. And yeah, for the first several years Connor /is/ a wanker that gets way to much love from the Light wizards, but that's an intentional conflict driver.
