I'm not sure about it being /awful/, but linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) certainly doesn't tell you much about the story. And the sequel names have a pattern - Initiate, Identity, Impose, Intensity - which is kind of cool, but really not informative.

The series is excellent, though. It's based on Sirius escaping Azkaban a few years early, coming to check on Harry, finding him unhappy, and offering him another home - while still being on the run from the law, and now everyone including Dumbledore thinks Harry's been kidnapped. The characterisation of Sirius and Remus (who's searching for them) is great, and watching eight-year-old Harry blossom in the care of a parental figure who wants him is really sweet.

The most misleading summary I've come across is for linkffn(Grow Young With Me). It's actually a really touching hurt/comfort story of Harry looking after his children after being widowed, and meeting someone who draws him out of his shell and helps him learn to love again.
