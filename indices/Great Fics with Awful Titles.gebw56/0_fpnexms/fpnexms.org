Very definitely linkffn(Horry Patter and the Philogoger's Stone). It has one of the most unique and inventive magic systems I've seen in a fic, and a very interesting plot. You just need to get past the names.

linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) might also fit, being an absolutely brilliant fic.
