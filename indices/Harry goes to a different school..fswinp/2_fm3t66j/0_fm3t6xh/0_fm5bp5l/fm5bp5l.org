Irish Choice and It's My Life are essentially the same fic, I can't distinguish the two of them. Manipulative Dumbledore is my most guilty pleasure.

I think linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar) is in the same vein. IIRC there are some offputting moments but it's overall pretty satisfying in the same way those two were.
