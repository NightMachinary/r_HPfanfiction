While I don't think side-plots HAVE to be about the main characters, I believe they have to be linked one way or another to the main story.\\
For example, I think movie Half Blood prince do an excellente job with Draco scenes. During all the movie we see him working on a closet, not understanding what it is (at least for the one who had not read the book) but seeing Draco apparence change as his deadline approach and he is more stressed. And in the end we finally see Draco smuggling Death Eaters into the castle and understand his mission, and his plan.\\
Another example (still in movie) would be Seamus Finnigan. He is not a main character, but during all the movie we see him blowing things up, until the last movie where his knowledge of explosives is used in the Battle.\\
I personnaly prefer when side plots are used to evolve side character (giving them new capacities, morals) rather than main cast. We see them enough already.
