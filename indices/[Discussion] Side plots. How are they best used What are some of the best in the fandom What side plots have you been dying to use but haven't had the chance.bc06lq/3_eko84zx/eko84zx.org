As far as I understand it, the point of side-plots is to illuminate aspects of the main characters that we wouldn't otherwise get to see. From your two examples, Luna's struggles with bullying are used to reveal Harry's character growth in OotP, where at the beginning he finds her weird and is uncomfortable around her, but at the end of the book she is one of the only people he /is/ comfortable being around. Tonks & Remus' relationship drama is there so we can have the scene where Harry tells Remus off for not being responsible enough, which shows that Harry himself needs to be more responsible by searching for the Horcruxes instead of running off after the Hallows.

My guess is that the most engaging side plots are the ones that do a good job at this: telling us more about the main characters, while also being interesting stories in & of themselves. Sideplots are boring when thy are ultimately irrelevant and feature bland folks who we can't find a way to care about.
