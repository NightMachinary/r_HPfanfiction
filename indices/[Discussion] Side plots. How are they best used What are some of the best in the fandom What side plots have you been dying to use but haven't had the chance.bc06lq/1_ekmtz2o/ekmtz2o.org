I guess it depends on how the side plot ties into the general picture. If you just add some Ron/Hermione drama on the side and devote 25% of your story to that for the sake of doing so, that's not good writing. But if you keep throwing references to Grindelwald'sppath to darkness and he then shows up in the final battle and slaps the shit out of the Death Eaters with his dark spells you kept mentioning, that is a clever setup.

The decision whether a side plot had a sufficient payoff to justify its existence is up to the individual.
