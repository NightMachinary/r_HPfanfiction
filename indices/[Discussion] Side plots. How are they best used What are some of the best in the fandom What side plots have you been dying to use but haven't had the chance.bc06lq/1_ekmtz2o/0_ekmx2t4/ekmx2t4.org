  If you just add some Ron/Hermione drama on the side and devote 25% of your story to that for the sake of doing so, that's not good writing.

I'd argue there's a right way to do this, but I agree that this is the type of side plot that gets tiresome quickly. It's just such a vague notion.

  But if you keep throwing references to Grindelwald'sppath to darkness and he then shows up in the final battle and slaps the shit out of the Death Eaters with his dark spells you kept mentioning, that is a clever setup.

Exactly, foreshadowing is key for side plots.

  The decision whether a side plot had a sufficient payoff to justify its existence is up to the individual.

Well there's a rather worthless statement.

edit: Worthless in that it's always true that whether or not any scene or idea is up to the writer to decide if it's worth including. I agree with the sentiment.
