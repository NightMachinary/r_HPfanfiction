Sideplots are only as a good as the characters driving them.

If the characters are bland, annoying, poorly developed, or not developed at all, then the readers have no investment and will not be interested. Fanfic writers have trouble making the MC, Harry, into a likeable character and often bank on his abilities (boosted magical core, 9000 inheritances) to draw the readers, rather than giving him an actual personality. Naturally, the secondary or tertiary characters will be even less interesting.

To make them interesting: give them a concrete challenge, give them clear goals, and make them struggle to achieve them. That's how you invest a reader. The same rules apply to side characters /and/ main characters, though many authors struggle to do that for any character.

One of the most memorable side plots was Fiona the police officer, a muggle OC from Harry Potter and the Natural 20. The MC himself was an OC, but still an excellent character because he (and Fiona) were challenged, and were forced to figure out creative ways to solve their problems.
