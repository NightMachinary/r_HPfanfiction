Yes, the argument can be made that Petunia was actually worse to Harry than Vernon (and she was actually the blood relative, not him). And although I love her redemption stories, is it just a common misandry, that most such stories describe her as half-victim herself, when the books are rather clear that she was the one who instigated Harry's abuse?
