As anybody who ever tried to write a story, where Dursleys exist, can tell you, there is just crazily little about who Dursleys truly are. We have just absolutely unbelievable caricature of three human beings as viewed through eyes of very angry (rightfully) abused teenager, and that's it (films are even worse). For any attempt to write a story with them as real characters, you need to add a lot of character to them. That doesn't mean justifying them, they can be as horrible people as you wish, but making them more realistic and less caricature.

Big statements like this and generally deciding who is the source of what are mostly just projection of your own opinions on these caricatures.
