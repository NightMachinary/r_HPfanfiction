I'm not sure if it's canon or fanon, but there was also some trouble with James Potter during the wedding (I would like to say it was Petunia's wedding, not Lily's, but I'm not sure). It was probably the first real experience that Vernon had with wizards and it did not go well, so it only helped Petunia's narrative.
