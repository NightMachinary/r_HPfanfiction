I would say Petunia is the worst of them all due to one single fact.

She is the core source of the hatred against Harry. It is her hatred for all magic that spread to Vernon and Dudley and her hatred for Harry that spread to Marge. After all, she is the only one that knew of magic. No way Vernon could have hated it before he knew it even existed.\\
I am 100 % willing to bet she filled Vernon's head with poisonous ideas of what wizards are like and what magic is like, giving him a completely fucked up view on the whole thing, and then proceeding encounters with magic users only reinforced that idea (Dudley getting a pig-tail, getting shouted at through the phone, the stamps, his living room getting nearly destroyed in book 4.)

Maybe if Vernon had a better, and more neutral, introduction to magic and less unfortunate encounters with magical users afterwards, he would not have been as awful. Still bad as he is naturally judgemental towards anyone 'not normal', but maybe less so.
