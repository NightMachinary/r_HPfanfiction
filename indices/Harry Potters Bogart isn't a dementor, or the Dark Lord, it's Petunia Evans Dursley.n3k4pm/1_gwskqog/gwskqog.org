That sounds like an interesting lead-in for a Severitus story. Snape has to sub in for Lupin because it's near a full moon, he just reads off the notes while sniping at people and docking points because he doesn't want to be here and can't teach any of the things he wants to or feels they should know.

Harry's turn comes up and Snape decides to let it happen. Lupin and Dumbledore both warned him that his boggart would almost certainly be Voldemort, so he should intervene and stop it from happening. But Snape didn't even want to be here in the first place, and after listening to Lavender Brown titter with Parvati about who has the best or most gossip-worthy fear, and having to put up with Granger bouncing up and down with her hand in the air, he decides fuck it. Let the stupid children see Voldemort. Maybe they'll wise up.

But what steps out of that closet isn't the dark lord. It's somebody ELSE that Snape recognizes.

It's Petunia Evans. Little Tuny.

With a frying pan. She has a frying pan, in her hand. And she starts going after Harry while calling him a freak.

And Severus Snape's neat little world of black and white grudges and debts crumbles to dust beneath his feet.
