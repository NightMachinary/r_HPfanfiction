This Harry is a vengeful adult who has the mental capacity of a child. If he really wanted to bash dumbledore, all he had to do was let him take the fall for the chamber and then save Ginny. The Harry you've outlined is more concerned about being able to enable his “revenge” than save the life of an innocent child. He's just as bad as Voldemort.
