i can see this happening, with a harry that never got proper care or help after the war. maybe the media, the ministry, and the pressure of being a celebrity from his youth finally cracks him and he goes mad trying to find a way to get back at the man he considered the one responsible for it all, dumbledore.

as it stands this is definitely harry manipulating dumbledore, though one would assume its him manipulating dumbledore the way dumbledore had (or would have) manipulated him, when really its a kid who was forced to grow up too fast, who never had a solid foundation for mental health, and just wants it to stop hurting.
