I mean, there's a coherent plot and a character with consistent motivation. Even the morality is consistently iffy and Harry's new personality is consistently self-serving. There's nothing wrong with it. It's not my thing, personally, but put Harry in Slytherin or Ravenclaw and slap in a romance with Daphne Greengrass or Fleur Delacour and thousands of people will adore it.

It seems to hit all the notes like bashing that people like. If you want a super popular fic and you can write half-decently, go for it.

(lmao this may come off a bit salty, but I am a bit salty.)
