I think Henry is the best choice for having Harry as a nickname (Prince Harry is really Prince Henry) and was Fleamont's father's name. Harrison is a great name but has a strong identity with Harrison Ford and William Henry Harrison was a US president. Honestly I'd rather read any of those names than Hadrian.
