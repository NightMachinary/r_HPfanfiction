Well, the name choices aren't horrible, per se, as I actually think they add an extra something to the atmosphere of the fic, but linkffn(Horry Patter and the Philogoger's Stone) is a fic I've mentioned often; because if it weren't for the unfortunate title and the fact that it makes most people completely ignore the fic, I think it'd have been much more popular for that intriguing of a plot and the brilliantly designed world and magic system.
