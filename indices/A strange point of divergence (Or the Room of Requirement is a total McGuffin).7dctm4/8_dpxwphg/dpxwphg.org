I think there is a fic that use the room like the hyperbolic time chamber from dragon ball . And one that lets the user call up a copy of any wizard that has ever been in hogwarts to teach them

And my personal theory that the room of requirement literally helped Harry teach and that is why a bunch of student all managed to learn the Patronus charm when it is a beyond N.E.W.T level spell that the majority of adult wizard can't do.
