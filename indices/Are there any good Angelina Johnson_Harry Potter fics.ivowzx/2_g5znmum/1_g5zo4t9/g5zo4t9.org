Yeah that's why I was hoping to find some with this post. I think I've read 2 stories that were not a multi/harem/background pairing. I just think it's an interesting pairing and I like to read those fics. I understand why they aren't popular, they aren't main characters in the books/movies but I wish there were more stories based around them. I honestly dont mind smut as long as it has a good storyline, but I prefer a more romantic story than what most smut ones provide
