Ahh, I see you are a man of culture. 2 sisters and their best friend, nice, nice. Sadly, this probly doesn't exist. Most multi stories have fleur+ 2 or 3 girls from different houses and that aren't related.

These types are tricky. Some people would go "hell ya, sisters, the DREAM". Others will go "ew, sisters, that's incest".

Depending on choice in females or males sexually, people would likely belong to "fuck ya sisters" if they were into girls, and "ew that's fuckin incest" if they liked guys. Because of this, it's likely very few people attempt to write such a fic.

Personally, since I dig chicks, and lesbians are hot (even though as a dude I have zero chance to take part lol), I belong to the "fuck ya, sisters!" Group.

If one does pop up I'd read it lol
