Harry was never officially clued in on a Fidelius Charm over the Tonks home. The Secret Keeper has to officially inform anyone verbally or in writing before they can get inside or even find the place; that was established in OotP ("The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London"). This never happened in DH, so it's highly unlikely that the Fidelius Charm was used.
