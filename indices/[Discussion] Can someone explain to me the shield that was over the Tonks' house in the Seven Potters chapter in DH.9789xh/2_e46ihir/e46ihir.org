It was later said in DH (when the ministry came under Voldemort's control) that the Death Eaters now freely used illegal spells without fear of imprisonment under the guise of searching for Undesirable Number One. This means that those protections can be broken but they require the use of illegal spells. Those protections probably had Harry and Hagrid keyed in.

When Voldemort attacked Harry and Hagrid, Scrimgeour was the minister. It would not take a lot of time for the Aurors to reach the location when Voldemort used those illegal spells to break the protection. Voldemort could easily have subdued all of them (Aurors) but by then Harry and Hagrid would have escaped thus negating the need for using those brutal spells in the first place.

I think this was the reason why Voldemort didn't break those protections. It was not due to his incompetence but rather the fact that it was unmerited.
