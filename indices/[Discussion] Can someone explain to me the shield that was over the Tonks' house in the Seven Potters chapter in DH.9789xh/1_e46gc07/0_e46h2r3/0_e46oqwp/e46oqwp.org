Well, modality isn't really about the future as such. Consider "if I was in orbit of Jupiter, I would see a planet". It's not about the future because I'm not ever going to be in orbit of Jupiter. Nonetheless it is true. It's a true fact about a hypothetical state of affairs.

The precise status of modal facts is the subject of much philosophical debate, but for me it's sufficient to note that a magic system which recognises job positions and secrets could no doubt recognise modal facts.
