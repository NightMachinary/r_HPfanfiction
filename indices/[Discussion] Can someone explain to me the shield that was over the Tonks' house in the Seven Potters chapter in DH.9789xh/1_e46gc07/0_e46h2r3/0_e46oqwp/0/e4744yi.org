You need at the very least a model of the world that allows you to make predictions about future states based on the current state.

Otherwise magic can't make "decisions" such as "If I let this person enter, they will come to harm".

That does not mean that the prediction is necessarily accurate, but such a prediction needs to be made in some form or another.

This is also a current topic of AI-researches, as a model that can predict future state (even to an exteny) is a key component of AI.

Some curre t technology like the new (I think IBM?) Dota-AI bots rely heavily on such a predictor, at least for training.
