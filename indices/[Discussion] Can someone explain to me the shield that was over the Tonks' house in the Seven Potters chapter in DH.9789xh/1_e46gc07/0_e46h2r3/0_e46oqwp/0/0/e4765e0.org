There are lots of other analyses of modal facts than possible futures, and indeed possible future is a pretty poor explanation given that there are modal facts which are true and yet are impossible futures. (Silly example "If space was filled with water instead of a vacuum, the universe would be wet").

I think you may have got the wrong end of the stick a bit, because the truth status of modal facts is not anything to do with what algorithms an intelligence might use to determine/discover those facts. They are objectively true facts about the universe, not a state of mind held by an intelligence. The truth of "if I was orbiting Jupiter, I would see a planet" no more depends on an intelligence making a prediction than does the truth of "if I drop this ball, it would fall" i.e. the existence of gravity. The universe can be characterised as a set of facts, and modal facts are a subset of those facts.

One explanation proposed is that they are facts about parallel universes. That's particularly attractive for philosophers who are attached to the correspondence theory of truth.
