  ...not really. Etymologically, for instance, Protego Horribilis seems to specifically protect against evil... stuff.

Etymologically, it's a bit of a mess. "Horribilis" is an adjective, "protego" is a verb. So gramatically it doesn't mean much.

One possible interpretation is "I protect against the horrible thing" (i.e. a shield that's particularly strong against Dark magic). But an alternative possibility is "I protect horribly" (i.e. a shield that harms those who attempt to cross it).

For people who consider the movies to be persuasive, there's some evidence towards the latter interpretation, as the Snatchers who attempted to cross the Protego Horriblis around Hogwarts were disintegrated.
