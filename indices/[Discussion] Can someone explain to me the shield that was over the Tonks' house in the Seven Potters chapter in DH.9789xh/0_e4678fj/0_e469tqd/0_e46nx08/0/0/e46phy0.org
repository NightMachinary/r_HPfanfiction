Ah. I always took it to be, in an /almost/ literal translation, "I protect against the horrible". "Horriblis", as you say, is after all an adjective, nor an adverb. And a spell that says right in its name that it's going to harm you horribly sounds like darker magic than I think the spell symbolically /should/ be concerning its role.

To your Snatchers example, we could oppose the Death Eaters' clearly-dark curses that splash against it, too, shortly before Volderalph goes /NYAAAAAAH/ and breaks the bubble.
