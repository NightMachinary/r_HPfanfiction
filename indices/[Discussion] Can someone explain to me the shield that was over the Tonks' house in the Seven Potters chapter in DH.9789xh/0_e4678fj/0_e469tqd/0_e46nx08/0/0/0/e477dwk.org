I mean, the real literal translation is "I protect horrible". The two interpretations of "I protect against the horrible thing" and "I protect horribly" are equally incorrect translations: the former because there's no noun for the adjective to modify, nor anything indicating "against", the latter because it's an adjective not an adverb. So whatever interpretation you pick requires departing from the literal translation.
