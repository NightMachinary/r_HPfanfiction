True. ...Now that I think about, literally, the easiest meaning of /Protego Horribilis/ to construe is that it's a dark spell that protects horrible things in earnest --- possibly the sort of spell you'd put on a Horcrux to protect it.

Still, my point stands that "I protect horribly" makes the spell sound more gruesome than inspiring and that's kind of unappealing, narratively.
