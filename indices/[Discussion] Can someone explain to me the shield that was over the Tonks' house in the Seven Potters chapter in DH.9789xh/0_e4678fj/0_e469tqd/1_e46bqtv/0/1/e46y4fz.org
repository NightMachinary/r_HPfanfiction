"So tell me, Harry," said Dumbledore. "Your scar...has it been hurting at all?"\\
Harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed the lightning-shaped mark.\\
"No," he said, "and I've been wondering about that. I thought it would be burning all the time now Voldemort's getting so powerful again."\\
He glanced up at Dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a satisfied expression.\\
"I, on the other hand, thought otherwise," said Dumbledore. "*Lord Voldemort has finally realised the dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying.* It appears he is now employing Occlumency against you."\\
