I've been a fan of Tim Joy's (Jeconais's) stories for awhile. Most of his work is excellent and quite polished for fanfiction, though you do have to accept that Harry's pretty much over-the-top over-powered, meaning that they're often more about style than drama with any real tension. I consider them to be the fanfiction equivalent of eating comfort food. I'm less entranced by his more recent stories, which seem to have gone downhill since /Happily Ever After/, but his earlier work is worth reading.

Some recommendations, all of which are linked from [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/][Jeconais's page on fanficauthors.net]]:

/Hope/ is very good, a complete, novel-length piece; the pairing is Harry/Gabrielle Delacour, set post-Hogwarts.

/Perfect Situations/ (and sequel) is quite well done for a Harry/Daphne Greengrass pairing, though it'll feel clich√©. I believe that it started the "Daphne as Slytherin Ice Queen" meme.

/This Means War/ is a bit crackish (at one point, Harry rides a dragon into outer space), but one of the quintessential Harry/Ginny tales. Also novel-length and complete.

/The Object Lessons Trilogy/ is amusing, especially given its prompt. "Hey Tim, I bet you could write a story about Harry going to get a glass of water and everyone would read it."

/Perfect Slytherins/ is one of the best Harry Potter/Addams Family crossovers you'll find.

/Best Man/ is a longish one-shot, a Harry/Fleur teaser, that's nicely done.

Incidentally, Jeconais was one of the most popular fanfiction writers back during the lull between OOtP and HBP; he originated many of the tropes that have become hackneyed by now.
