Pansy can be a surprisingly strong female lead, though it is hard to make it believable without Harry becoming a bit grey himself.

I've seen each of the Slytherin main females done well, though Tracy is usually boring without Daphne (think Hannah without Susan...) and Mili is...always an interesting choice.

Pansy makes a really good Tsundere for a harem setting too. I didn't even realize I was writing her that way in one of my stories. It's been done for almost 2 years and I only just realized it.
