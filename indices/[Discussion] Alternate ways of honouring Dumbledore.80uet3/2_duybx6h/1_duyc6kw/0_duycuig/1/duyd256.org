I agree, I personally like Albus' name. Now Severus name on the other hand is very strange/different/unusual. Not to say I hate Severus, he's actually one of my favorite characters in the series despite his flaws that he has. (Or maybe because of them). I'm just saying his name is much more different/unusual compared to say Albus.
