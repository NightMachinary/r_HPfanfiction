Probably because other people (unlike Harry) realized that would be putting an unnecessary weight on their son's shoulders by always being compared to Dumbledore.

I've always wondered if Al was the kid who was born early so they didn't have a name prepared:

"Harry, we forgot to think of names before he was born! Quick, think of something!"

"Um -- um..." Harry looks at the Chocolate Frog cards he has in his hands. "Albus Severus!"

The nurse writes it down before they can actually think about it.

"...You don't think that'll put him in Slytherin, do you?" Ginny asks with great trepidation.

His shoulders slump. "I don't know," Harry says mournfully. "But he'll definitely hate us."
