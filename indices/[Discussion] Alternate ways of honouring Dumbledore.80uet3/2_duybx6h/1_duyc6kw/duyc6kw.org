See, I disagree. Albus is a terrible name. There's a reason no one uses it....but combined with a name like Severus makes it definitely worse.

As a name, Severus is ok. As for who it's after - I mean, it's not that I hate Snape, but to name a child after him? It's an honour he'd hate, and debatedly didn't earn. I definitely feel Arthur earned the honour over Snape. Hell, Kingsley and Moody probably contributed directly to Harry's life as much as Snape did.
