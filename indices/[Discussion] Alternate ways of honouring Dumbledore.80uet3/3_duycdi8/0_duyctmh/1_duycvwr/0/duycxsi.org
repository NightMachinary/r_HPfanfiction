Well, to me, naming one's son after oneself is actually /weirder/. I mean, think of the confusion this would (and does!) cause. At least with the Potter children, the names might be /weird/ to the people who knew James, Dumbledore & Co., but there's no risk of /actual/ confusion.

Either way, I meant the Barty situation to parallel that with Molly and Percy's daughter, not James Sirius, Albus Severus and Lily Luna.
