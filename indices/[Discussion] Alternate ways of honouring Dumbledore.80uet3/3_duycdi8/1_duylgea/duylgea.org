I'm not overly fond of Albus Severus but at least you can tell the difference between Albus Dumbledore and Albus Potter.

But the fact we now have to differentiate between James & Lily Potter the married couple and James & Lily Potter the siblings still kind of icks me out.

And for Percy and George's kids, the problems are compounded because there aren't exactly many nicknames for Molly or Fred. Molly and Fred are themselves diminutive versions.
