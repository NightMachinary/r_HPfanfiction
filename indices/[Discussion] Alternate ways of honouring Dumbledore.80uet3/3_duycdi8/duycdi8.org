That's why I don't really agree with the names that Rowling gave the Next Gen, or the ones that are named after dead loved ones. I understand it's to honor them, but using one name as a middle name and another name that isn't connected to anyone that they know or loved that died as a first name in my opinion would be better. (At least in my opinion).

I mean James Sirius, Albus Severus, Lily Luna. Just seems to be way too much. And people are just going to see them as mini Albus Dumbledore's, mini James Potter, mini Lily Evans because of the first name.

Percy even named one of his daughter's after his still living mother. I get that he loves and respects her, but in my opinion even that is too much.

George named his son after his dead twin brother, again it's a sweet idea but when you really think how messed up the kid will probably be because of it, that's just too much. (IMO).

I've gotten used to the names, but if Rowling had thought of other names I would have been much happier.
