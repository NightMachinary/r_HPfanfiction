Yeah, I agree. It's a theme even with the original generation tho; James named his son after his grandfather, and himself. Draco was named after Lucius, Bill after Arthur, Percy and Ron after uncles, Ginny after her mum, and let's not mention all the Sirius's in the Blacks, or a certain TM Riddle.

It some ways, it almost looks like lazy naming on Jo's part.
