Well Rowling was incredibly creative with names, naming the Black family after stars, naming the Evan's after flowers, naming characters after gods or Shakespearean people ect extra, so I suppose doing the same name twice or more than that would be understandable in that case.

Edit: Still feel bad for the kids though.
