I really do have to admire how much thought she came up with for the names.

For instance, for Dolores Umbridge.

Umbrage which is where the name comes from: Offense, annoyance, displeasure. Which describes her well.

Rita Skeeter: Skeeter is a slang term for a mosquito, which is likely in reference to her Animagus form an insect.

Voldemort: Flight of Death, which is very fitting for Voldemort since he feared death.

And many other names that she thought of to go with the characters. So while I might have some issues with some of the Next Gen names, I do have to admire the ones that she did think of to put meaning behind the character.
