Naming traditions are very common in the real world and HP too. Ginny and Harry naming their children like that does not come out of nowhere-it follows what we've seen in canon. Just look at the Weasleys. There's Ginevra Molly and William Arthur with middle names from their parents. There's the twins who have the same F/G naming convention as Mrs. Weasley's brothers, Fabian and Gideon. Or Percy's middle name, Ignatius, which is probably after Ignatius Prewett. We see other naming traditions such as the Blacks, who pull from astronomy, or the Evans, who used flowers.
