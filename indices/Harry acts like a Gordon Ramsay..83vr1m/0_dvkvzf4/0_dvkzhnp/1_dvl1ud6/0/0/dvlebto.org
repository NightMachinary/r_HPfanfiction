I agree with this sentiment and I'm not even a huge Gordon Ramsay fan. But from what I've seen, he only ever flips out when he feels like whomever he's working with isn't interested in putting in the time or effort. He will go to great lengths to help people who are trying to better themselves.

A lot of people see him yelling on TV on things like Kitchen Nightmares. Well, I'm sure some of it is staged, but when the people are utterly disinterested in his help, and the kitchen has mold growing in it, he should be screaming at them.
