Well, if you actually think about it...Other than Quidditch, Harry doesn't really interact much with other people. Hell he didn't even get to know Seamus and Dean and they slept in the same room as the guy.

And the only information he acts gets from Neville wasn't even from Neville. He accidentally found out through other means.

Other than Ron and Hermione, Harry doesn't really go out of his way to actually bond with anyone else.
