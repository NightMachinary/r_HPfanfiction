Do we know that? I guess if you go with the assumption that Hogwarts is the only school then your numbers make sense. I also just find that so amusing because they're all like thinking they're so significant in the world and it's like you're a culty, violent clique at most, lmao. It's like that feeling in doctor who where they'd build up this massive story line and the final battle is between like twenty people.

I have seen a few different fanfics that have Hogwarts as being more of a dying elitist institution with a lot of other schools and things spread throughout the UK. As much as I hate that grooming fic, dodging prison and stealing witches has the structure I've sort of embraced in my own head cannon (I had already thought it but that author fleshed it out way better than I had) with a population of wix that are rural and hidden, and don't really get involved with Diagon alley or the ministry or Hogwarts, or even schooling at all. then you have the working class who are a bit more tradespeople and go to school in a shoe or whatever, and then the middle class who work in the lower rungs at the ministry, and then the Hogwarts set, the lowest of whom are the Weasleys

The idea that the wars have destroyed the population is also valid though. I was struck at the size of the ministry in the fantastic beasts movie because there's no way the ministry for the population in Harry Potter would use that much space

Even so though, I definitely don't think there would be more than a million people in magical Britain. It would populate m a large town at most, you're totally right.

To answer your question, a lot of my biggest peeves are based on the movies, so I can't even blame the ff authors so much as I hate the aesthetic that the movies brought in.

I suppose a big peeve is the weird way people like Arthur Weasley think about muggles when seriously you live in the world and use a telephone to get into the ministry, why would you call it a ‘felletone?' Like there seems to be this massive discrepancy between the way they actually manage to hide themselves from the Muggle world, and then the canon behaviour where they act like fools and wear nighties

And the biggest one is the way that they go about being Victorian when they separated during the medieval era. So so annoying. Why would the Muggle-hating Blacks have gaslights in their house? It makes no sense!

With things like the Express I have decided that Queen Victoria really was such a bossy pants that she would be like ‘oh there's a secret magical world, is there? Better boss them around as much as the Muggle population. They obviously need a train', but the Black family having post-industrial-revolution decor is very strange to me (other than oooooooh creepy aestheticccccccs)
