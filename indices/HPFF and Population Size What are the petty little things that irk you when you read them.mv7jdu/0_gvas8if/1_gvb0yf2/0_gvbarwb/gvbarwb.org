Whot. That's so inaccurate I can't even. People have their own reasons for not being chrisitian, and a lot of young people definitely aren't doing it to be cool. That's such a gen x call

I might have thought like that as a kid as an elder millennial who grew up listening to grunge or whatever, but in the end moved away from the Christianity of my parents because of its colonialist/genocidal history, which a lot of millennial, gen y and gen z kids care very much about. But again, it's personal. Choosing not to worship is just as personal as choosing to worship
