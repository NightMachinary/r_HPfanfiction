  Gavin: It might be that fanfic circles in general attract people with a grudge against Christianity and/or the conventional morality derived therefrom (I oversimplify for brevity).

It is now fashionable to be anti-Christian, because most teenage readers/writers of fanfiction somehow live with a weird idea that the establishment is pro-Christian and they can be edgy and anti-establishment if they are anti-Christian. Nothing can be further from truth, but I am afraid I won't be able to change the worldwide fashion to be sensible. Fashions usually are not.
