The simple answer to all this is that Rowling either put a very low premium on consistency or was terrible at it. I've read statements by her to the effect that the population of Wizarding Britain was about 3,500 (fewer than the /neighborhood/ I live in!), and that she sucks at math.

​

As for the sheer size of the Ministry and its bureaucracy, well, the whole of Wizarding Britain might fit into a small to middling town (depending on how you world build it), with magical transportation blunting the effect of physical distance, *but* it consists of people who can do magic and base much of their identity in that fact, with the added burden of having to preserve the Statute of Secrecy.

Magic is a Big Deal, by the way. Living in a small town where "everyone knows everyone" breeds conformity and an aversion to high drama, but having supernatural powers encourages nonconformity and risk-taking. How much more unruly would /you/ be, if you had powers like teleportation, conjuration (however limited), combat power roughly equivalent to modern man-portable firearms up to RPGs (minus the long range), invisibility on demand (clothes included), *mind control,* etc.?

The Ministry must therefore spend orders of magnitude more resources to control and govern this government's nightmare of a population, including creating a lot of jobs, many of which may be sinecures most or all of the time (This might even be partially if not mostly funded by the unaware Muggle taxpayer: if the Wizarding bureaucracy numbers no more than a few thousands, it would be a small item in the British national budget, and easy to hide).

Gavin: It might be that fanfic circles in general attract people with a grudge against Christianity and/or the conventional morality derived therefrom (I oversimplify for brevity). The HP novels themselves are *very* Christian under the surface.
