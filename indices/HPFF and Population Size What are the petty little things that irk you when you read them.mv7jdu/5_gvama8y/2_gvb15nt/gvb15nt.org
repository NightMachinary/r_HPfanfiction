And what I said above: it is now fashionable and kewl to be anti-Christian, because for reasons I have never got people think that the establishment is pro-Christian and thus they feel like rebels. Moreover, it is completely cheap and risk-free rebellion, because in fact, everybody will cheer you up if you are anti-religion.
