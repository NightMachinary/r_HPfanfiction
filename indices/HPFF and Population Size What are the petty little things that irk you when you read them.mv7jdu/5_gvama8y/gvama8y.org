I've estimated the total population of wizarding Britain to be a bit larger, about 15,000. However, that calculation is based on the 200 Slytherins cheering their team at the end of PoA. It's likely that in that very year the school-aged population of Britain was at an all-time low because of the war. Taking that into account, the total population might well be twice as large. But I agree with your point. That's too small a population to need as much bureaucracy as JKR showed the Ministry to have.

One thing that I've grown to dislike is the habit of shoehorning paganistic traditions and elements into the wizarding world as an inconsequencial type of worldbuilding that ends up having nothing to do with anything. I'm OK with it if it's done well and really adds something to the story. But usually it seems to be just a few mentions here and there as if paganism is a canon element of the wizarding world in the same way as blood purism.

Does the Harry Potter fandom attract people who have some grudge against Christianity? However, many things in the Harry Potter books (I don't care about any other material) suggest that British witches and wizards are just as Christian as their Muggle neighbours.

1. They celebrate Christian holidays such as Easter, Hallowe'en and Christmas, and at least the Christmas song Sirius sang in 1995 mentions God.

2. One of the Hogwarts ghosts was a friar in life.

3. At least in Godric's Hollow wizards and Muggles share a graveyard that is located next to a church.

4. Phrases "my God", "thank God" and "for God's sake" are being used quite commonly by wizard-raised people such as Ron, Mrs Weasley, Lupin, Malfoy and Fudge.

5. The mainstream ethics of wizarding Britain doesn't seem to have any significant difference to that of Muggle Britain, and the mainstream ethics of Muggle Britain is based on Christianity.

There is absolutely no evidence about wizards being pagans or atheists. Clearly JKR intended wizards to be Christians, but decided not to tell it explicitly because it would have caused controversy without adding anything to the story.

Does anyone know why it is so common in Harry Potter fanfics to change this part of the canon?
