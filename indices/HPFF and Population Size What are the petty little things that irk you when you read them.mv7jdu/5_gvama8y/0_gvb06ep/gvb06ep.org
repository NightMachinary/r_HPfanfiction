Ah I see. Well, HP has wide appeal, I won't judge. I agree too that HP is based on very traditional British literature foundations, which owing to the nation's history and general makeup are generally Christian in nature. But even though I am one myself I don't insist on FF authors sticking to the point. Live and let live I guess.
