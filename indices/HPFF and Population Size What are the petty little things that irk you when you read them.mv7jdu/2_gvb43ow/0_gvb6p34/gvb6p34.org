Ah, economics. Well, TLDR version, the true underclass would be Squibs who are no better than Muggles and so don't have access to advanced magical farming spells.

Otherwise at nearly the bottom you have the like of the Weasleys who probably had roots as magical subsistence farmers before Mr Weasley got a "City job". With magic farming must be extremely easy. That settles basic needs.

What keeps working class wizards down however would not be food or even education - Hogwarts has scholarships and is extensively funded. It would be expenditures on magical necessities such as Floo powder, wands, potion ingredients, Doxy spray, etc. Basically wizards enjoy a certain better quality of life compared to muggles, never truly starvation poor and with better life expectancy, but they have magical problems to deal with as well, creating a natural magical economy and socio-economic strata that should be little different from ours.

It would be interesting to go into all this in detail but I suspect it would be quite boring to most people, lol.
