Perhaps combat magic is as rare as combat skills are IRL. Even Hogwarts did not actually teach much combat magic - Umbridge stepped in at the first sign that the curriculum was veering off from its Dark-animal-centric focus. I suspect Snape might have been toughening up the student population in Harry's 6th year, on Dumbledore's orders, in his own terrible way.

Given the ease of farming and multiplication charms I reckon nobody magical actually starves, food and basic basket of goods surplus capacity must be insane. Even if many wizards are incapable (which I don't personally think so), all you need is a dozen capable wizards at the Ministry, and that's sorted.

Magical plagues is the one problem that could seriously affect magical quality of life. The major international trade goods of the Wizarding world must I think be medical potions ingredients and personal spell services...
