Well I think that Defense Against Dark Arts is mostly a theoretical subject. Students know how to identify some curses and dark creatures and some small defensive spells to facilitate your escape are taught. The main point is conflict resolution as shown by the fact that the only major offensive spell up until book 4 is the Disarming Spell, that is taught during the Dueling Club, and the Patronus, which is taught to Harry in private.

All the offensive spells, as well as the shield charm, used in later books are self-taught by Harry in preparation for third task. He later teaches these spells to the DA. Later on, Snape, takes a more practical approach teaching students how to duel, but they are in the middle of a war. So I think the average witch or wizard is not very good at dueling, unless they complete their Auror training or are competitive duelists.
