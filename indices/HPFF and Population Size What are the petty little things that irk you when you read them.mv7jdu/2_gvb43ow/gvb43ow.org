I don't understand how there can exist the class of the poor and the rich when everyone has magic. How do the rich acquire their wealth and what does this wealth consist of exactly? Obviously, there should be some mechanisms at place that prevent the poor to become equal to the rich. I also suspect that there are families so underprivileged that they can't even afford for their kids to go to Hogwarts. Basically, it irks me that there's no realistic explanation of how the economy of the wizarding world functions. But at the same time it's not surprising, because in canon we see everything mostly though Harry's eyes, and he doesn't bother with figuring this out.
