I would agree, but JKR made it at least a large bureaucracy. They have a 10 floor office building, and at least some of the departments are in shift work.

There's 40 people in Harry's year, but a few hundred people in Slythering according to one of the quidditch descriptions.

There's a full professional quidditch league in Britain, and multiple leagues worldwide.

Andorra has it's own MoM. How?

Not remotely consistent with a pop of <30k for Britain, and a few hundred thousand world wide. Not that she seems to be consistent in numbers in interviews either. JKR is terrible at math and the hard parts of World Building. She also doesn't seem to track any of that from one book to the next.
