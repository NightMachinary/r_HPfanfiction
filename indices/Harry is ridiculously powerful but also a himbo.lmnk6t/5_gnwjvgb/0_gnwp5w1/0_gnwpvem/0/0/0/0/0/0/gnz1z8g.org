You're probably right. I shouldn't be so flippant about it. If someone read it and it upset them I would of course be more sympathetic but merely being upset that it exists is not something I can understand.

The thing people need to understand is that for me and for my friend, who helps come up with ideas for me to write, and likely for most of my readers...it isn't a case of us fetishizing children. My friend and I are both bottoms and when we read or I write fics about children we're putting ourselves in the child's place. The ones I write where Harry is in his late teens are much more disturbing to my mind because those can come across as if I'm advocating for that kind of behavior. Which I very much am not.

I get that it can be upsetting, I frequently make myself cry while writing my fics. I don't think that means they shouldn't be written however. This fic in particular as much as it makes light of the issue of consent in a lot of ways it also addresses those issues at several points.

If we had been discussing something violent no one would have felt the need to argue I shouldn't write something in which there is violence, yet that can be just as upsetting and just as revolting.
