Well.. I can think of one that sorta fits.

It Could Only Happen to Harry by HoosYourDaddy

Something to do with defeating Voldemort led to a massive increase in Harry's raw magical power. It's too much for his body to handle and it will kill him. Luckily, Pomfrey talked to some fellow medical professionals that she knows and one of them has an answer. Transferring magical potential via ritual sex magic.

The fic is surprisingly decent and funny, considering the premise. Very smutty though, in case that wasn't clear.
