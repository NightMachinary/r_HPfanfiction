Potions in the wizarding world appear to have relatively short (or wildly inconsistent)shelf lives, not to mention that all the forms of wizarding travel occur with quite violent movement, making it seem like broken potion bottles would be common ( especially because despite technically having spells to stop things from breaking, wizards are idiots and I truly doubt they would remember to use them) Thus making the Mandrakes a more reliable resource to then turn into a potion yourself

Which returns back to my original comment
