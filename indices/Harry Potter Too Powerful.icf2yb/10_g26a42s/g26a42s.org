This happens to Harriet Potter in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series - especially in book three. She has to wear power-limiting jewelry with dangerous side effects, or else she can't properly cast any spells at all, and she becomes a target of people like Riddle who want to exploit her potential.

And she does eventually gain proper control - but only through an intensely traumatic experience that has lasting side effects of its own, such as an enduring foreign presence in her head of considerable power and uncertain intentions.
