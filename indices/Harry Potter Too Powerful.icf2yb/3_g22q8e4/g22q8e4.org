This fic isn't entirely based around your prompt, but I do believe it has elements of it in it. In Refiner's Fire, Harry gets a plot driven massive power boost (the Refiner's Fire), and struggles with controlling his power post boost. Like there's a scene where he tries to levitate a quill and he bricks it into the ceiling. And he has to learn to fine tune it, from the basics. However, it's not the actual main plot, and more of an ongoing side conflict alongside the main plot.
