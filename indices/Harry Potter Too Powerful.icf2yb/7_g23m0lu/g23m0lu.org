There's a book by Rainbow Rowell called Carry On which is clearly inspired by HP Fanfiction. The main character has insane power but almost no ability to control it, so I think you'd really like it.

I wouldn't normally rec a book on this sub, but Carry On was written as a stand in for HP fanfiction in another of the authors books, so it kind of counts!
