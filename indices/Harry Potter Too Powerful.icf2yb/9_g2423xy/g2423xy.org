It's only for some spells, but this happens in [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54][Meaning of One]]. Harry (and Ginny because it's a soul bond fic,) almost kills a character with bluebell flames, you know the spell that makes flames that /don't/ burn. And then when they do get get a chance to let that spell loose, it's a like natural disaster.
