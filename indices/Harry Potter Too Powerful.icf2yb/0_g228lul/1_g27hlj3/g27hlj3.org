The Final Battle:

Spells arced through the air like metors, crashing against the faltering shield around Hogwarts. Voldemort's armies stood row on row, black-robed, masked Death Eaters in the center and the more ragged Snatchers and Imperiused victims on the wings, firing down on the beleagured school, the towering shadows of giants in the rear while a black cloud of Dementors swarmed over head, obscuring the stars. Harry could see the defenses failing- in a moment they would break, and Voldemort and his followers would storm the school, slaughtering everyone inside. Slowly, he raised his wand, and pointed it in the general direction of Voldemort's army. The aim didn't really matter, but he kept it at the center, where the Death Eaters were. He didn't want to hurt the innocent if he could help it.

"Bombardo Maximus!"

The Earth erupted in a column of fire and dust and flying boulders, an entire hillside vanishing in a single wrenching burst of destruction. The shock wave hit a moment later, shattering windows and bowling over many of the defenders, Harry among them. When he sat up, nothing remained of Voldemort and his Death Eaters, save for a few scraps of charred clothing. Here and then on the fringes, a few bodies lay, some moaning and writhing, others silent and still. Others were stumbling into the woods, or apparating away with cracks he could not hear, his ears still ringing from the blast. Even the Dementors had been scattered. Harry quickly averted his gaze, swallowing hard. With one spell, one moment of letting loose after all those years of carefully-learned control, he had killed... he didn't know how many. The Second War was over, ended in a single blast of magic.
