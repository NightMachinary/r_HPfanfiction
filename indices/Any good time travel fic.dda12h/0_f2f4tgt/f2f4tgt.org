I like time travels that do not bother to rehash the 'time line':

Here are some time travels that throw away the "time line" completely:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): Hermione sends her memories and power to her two years old self.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688609/1/A-Little-More-Time][A Little More Time]], linkffn(3688609): Unspeakable Teddy Lupin tries to save his parents with a time turner.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Harry is thrown back to 1975 and has to team up with Bellatrix. This is my favorite time travel fic, and the characterization of Bellatrix is excellent.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8669569/1/][Don't Waste It]], linkffn(8669569): Wormtail time travel. He did well and remains in character.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5492188/1/][Doubting Thomas]], linkffn(5492188): Luna raised Tom Riddle, who still couldn't escape the fate of becoming a dark lord. But he would at least have Luna at his side this time.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/][Ginny Returns]], linkffn(4740107): The only completed Ginny lone time travel. She accomplished her primary mission objective efficiently and painlessly, but has to fit in this new reality.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717): Unique Hermione time travel to Marauder Era from James Potter's POV, and she isn't paired with anyone.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059): Harry ends up back in his 11 years old self. He decides to not get any kids involved this time.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Badly traumatized and deranged Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan return to their 8 years old selves. They don't waste any time to waste their enemies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9561455/1/Spectrum][Spectrum]], linkffn(9561455): Only an one-shot, but it's the only time travel in which Hermione kills off Tom Riddle in his orphanage.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We are the Golden Trio!]], linkffn(7405516): The Trio and a 5 day old Rose are thrown back to 1991. They defeat Voldemort in almost record time.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998): Powerful Harry somehow ended up in 1970 and busted a Death Eater raid right away. Bellatrix became very impressed.
