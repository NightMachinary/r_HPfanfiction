Sorry if my description in the post wasn't clear. This is an analysis of fics that list two characters, so I know this doesn't necessarily mean romantic pairings. I also included pairings that were marked with brackets for fics that had >2 characters, but this didn't change the result at all, since that system has only been around since 2013 and even then isn't used much.
