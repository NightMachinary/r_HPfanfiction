I really find it fascinating that the most popular pairing (according to your chart) that's actually cannon is James/Lily. It's my favorite so I feel somewhat vindicated. I have to imagine that it's because of the ability to make your own story out of it. You have a few basics: boy and girl meet, boy likes girl, girl hates boy, they spend 7 years in close quarters with each other, add some war turmoil, growing up, falling in love and you've got the J/L skeleton.

That is IF you wanted to go cannon. (Of course you don't have to). But even for cannon that's some bare bones to add on to. A perfect amount for a writer (and reader) to experience the story many times,in many ways, with the same ending.

Suffice to say: I'm happy to find Jily at #3.
