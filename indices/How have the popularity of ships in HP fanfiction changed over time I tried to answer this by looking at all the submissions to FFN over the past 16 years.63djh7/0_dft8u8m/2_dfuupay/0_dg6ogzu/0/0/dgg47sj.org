Seems simple to me. Slash popularity in general, Harry is the main character, Draco/Snape are the most consistently present antagonists (but Draco, unlike Snape, is Harry's age), "thin love between love and hate" cliche, "Romeo and Juliet star-crossed lovers" cliche, Tom Felton's looks, ...

I'm not really a fan, but there are so many possible reasons for people to get into it that I honestly can't imagine Harry/Draco not becoming a thing.
