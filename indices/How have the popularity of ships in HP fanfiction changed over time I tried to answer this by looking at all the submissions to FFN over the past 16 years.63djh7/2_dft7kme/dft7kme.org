You might remember [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3jmxv0/i_analyzed_the_character_choices_from_200000_fics/?st=j13gw1dp&sh=d431fc43][a previous post of mine]] where I looked at the popularity of various characters in HP fanfiction. Well I decided to go back and see how various pairings changed in popularity over time. I'm happy to answer questions about it, or if you're curious about a particular pairing, let me know and I'll try to tell you how it fared to the most popular ones mentioned in the post.
