Agreed, I was just idly speculating on whether it was likely to be equally true of other pairings featuring characters of Snape's generation (or older) or if it was Snape-specific.

My initial suspicion would be that the above average fan age for Snape is less to do with his age and more to do with the readers. I think as I have gotten older I see more shades of grey than when I was younger and it is this depth I appreciate in Snape's character as opposed to Lupin (for example).

It would be nice to see if the data bore that or if that is only my perception.
