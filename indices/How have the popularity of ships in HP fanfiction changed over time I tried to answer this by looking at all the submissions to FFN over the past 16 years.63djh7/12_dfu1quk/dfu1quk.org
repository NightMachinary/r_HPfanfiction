Wow. As someone who's favourite pairing is SS/HG I was unsurprised to see our black line hover toward the bottom without the grat peaks and troughs.

But looking closely your diagram suggests as of 2016 that Snamione is now more popular than Hinny, Harmony and Wolfstar. I admit, that feels untrue. (I don't doubt the veracity of your work, it just doesn't feel like it is the case.)
