The use of 3 and 4 characters has only been around since 2013, so the data before that point isn't from this. Even recently, though, Draco/Hermione and Draco/Harry have been more popular. You can check this yourself with the FFN browse tool and look at fics published within the last year. When I did it, Draco/Hermione had 3.8k and Draco/Harry had 3k, whereas Ron/Hermione had 1.8k had Harry/Ginny had 1.1k. These numbers include the fics with 3 and 4 characters listed.

And I haven't looked at word count. Maybe some pairings tend to be longer than others.
