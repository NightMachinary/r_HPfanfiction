How does this compare when you change number of stories to purely word count for each pairing?

I'm still having trouble believing this data. I'm betting the ones that are D/Ha and D/He are that high because usually those fics don't tag the other members while most canon pairings tag all of Hermione, Harry, Ron, and Ginny.
