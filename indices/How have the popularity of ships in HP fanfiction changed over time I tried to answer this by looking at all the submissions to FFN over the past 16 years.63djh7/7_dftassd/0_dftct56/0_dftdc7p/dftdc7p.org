That's *very* interesting. So there was an obvious Harry/Cho surge between GoF and OotP, people wrote about what was known, but when they realized it wasn't going anywhere, they just let go of it like a dirty old sock (hope there were some House-Elves around).

And Harry/Daphne really took flight when the books ended. Probably because people started remembering her because of Astoria.
