This is an interesting one. Harry/Daphne is 72nd most popular overall, right above Harry/Cho (73rd) and Arthur/Molly (74th). However, the trends over time are /extremely/ different between these pairings. [[http://i.imgur.com/n8L8wFj.png][Here's the graph!]].

Daphne/Harry is certainly more popular right now. It was the 28th most popular in 2016. Harry/Cho on the other hand, had a peak rank of 18th in 2003, but was 72nd in 2016.
