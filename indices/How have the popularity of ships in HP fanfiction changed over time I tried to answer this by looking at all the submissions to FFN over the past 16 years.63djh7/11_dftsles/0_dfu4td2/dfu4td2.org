Sure. [[http://i.imgur.com/4sRgS9W.png][Here's a graph with the 8 most popular F/F pairings I could find]]. Note that these are just fics with two female characters, so it may not necessarily be femslash.

It definitely agrees with your expectations. Hermione/Ginny was by far the most popular early on, but Fleur/Hermione and Bellatrix/Hermione were more popular in 2015 and 2016. Your observations are very good!
