Could you do a thing for femslash pairings? From what I can observe anecdotally, Hermione/Ginny used to be really popular but fell off a cliff in recent times, whereas Hermione/Bellatrix and Hermione/Fleur became increasingly popular. Ginny/Luna has gained substantial popularity lately, but I feel it's all on ao3 instead of ffn.net, and for whatever reason are almost always oneshots.
