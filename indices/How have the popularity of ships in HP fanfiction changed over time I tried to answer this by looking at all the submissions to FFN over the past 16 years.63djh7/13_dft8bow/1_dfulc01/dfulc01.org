I think if it were somehow possible count all ss/hp and ss/hg fics, snarry would come out on top. Possibly by a significant amount. The problem is this data (fascinating though it is) only accounts for fics posted on ff.net. Historically, before ao3, a very large amount snarry fics were posted on slash or snarry specific archives as ff.net had a very bad rep especially amongst slash fans. Even though ff.net's rep is much better these days, it seems a lot of slash writers prefer ao3.
