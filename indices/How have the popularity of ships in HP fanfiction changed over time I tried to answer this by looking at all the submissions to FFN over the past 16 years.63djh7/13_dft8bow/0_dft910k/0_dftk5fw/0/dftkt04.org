I don't know if I would call it a surge, since the overall number still went down. Its rank increased because it went down /less/ compared to others. As to why? I have no idea. A similar trend happened with Draco, i.e. Dr/H dropped more than Dr/Hr. It could be that slash fics in general became less popular on FFN, perhaps migrating to other sites.
