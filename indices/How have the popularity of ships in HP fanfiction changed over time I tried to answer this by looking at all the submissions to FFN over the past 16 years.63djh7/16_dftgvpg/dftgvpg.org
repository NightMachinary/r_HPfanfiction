Do you know where Hermione/Charlie ranks? I know it's not terribly popular but that pairing is what I like to read and write about.

Hopefully, Harry Potter Fanfiction does stabilize; obviously the spikes in 2010-2011 due to the final two films being released were very large, but I joined Fanficion.net only in 2015, therefore, I missed the "Golden Age" and following years where stories were released in large numbers. I still feel like it's popular but nowhere near what it once was.
