Draco Malfoy is also painted pretty heavily as an anti-hero in the last two books. He is stuck in the unfavorable position of being ordered to kill the most powerful wizard alive by the second most powerful wizard, who happens to be an evil maniac with a proverbial noose around the neck of his parents. He also isn't fully devoted to the movement of eliminating muggleborns, lacking the conviction to use the Unforgivable Curses. His insults in earlier years could easily have been rooted in jealousy of Hermione's intellect or friendship with Harry Potter.

Combined with the fact that his family has money and political weight I could see why authors would pair him with the most background developed female character. As a character I dislike him but he is honestly one of the best ones to read or write about, alongside Severus Snape and Tom Riddle.
