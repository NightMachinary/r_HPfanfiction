One oft-overlooked thing about the "Draco is overwhelmingly liked by women" statement is that it isn't a "Draco" so much as it is "Tom Felton".

My sister read the books before watching the movies and /loathed/ Draco, but after the movies stated' "Well, I can see why people like Malfoy now."

Edit: The exact same thing happened with Severus Snape/Alan Rickman, though on a less extreme scale.
