Nice, thank you for this. Have you considered filtering the 724k+ fics? E.g. consider only fics with 20k+/40k+/100k+ words, or/and only completed ones?

Maybe even something like the completion rate by pairing and year.

I think the overall popularity graph as a function not of the number of fics, but the number of words could be interesting.
