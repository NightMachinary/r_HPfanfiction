I agree about Ron, although I don't think I would attribute it to Rupert Grint as an actor or a person, more the writing of the screenplay.

IMO Ron and Ginny were both stronger/better characters in the books than in the movies. As people's memories of the book characters faded and were replaced by the (again IMO) inferior movie versions, perhaps their fondness for Ron and Ginny also faded somewhat. My guess is that this might be why Ron and Ginny as ff characters started out in the middle but ended up near the bottom.
