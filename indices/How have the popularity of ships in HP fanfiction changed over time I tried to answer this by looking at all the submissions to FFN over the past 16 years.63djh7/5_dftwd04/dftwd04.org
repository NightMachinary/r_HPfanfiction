Draco fics were popular from the very beginning, but I think part of the reason they've stayed so high is because of Tom Felton. He has stayed active in the HP community, doing things like comicon, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0_r8tAZQRA][filming a tour]] of WWoHP when it opened in FL, and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsjGYTtmlR4][adorably funny stuff like this]]. So people who may not have liked Draco the book character are fans now because they project more of Tom Felton's qualities onto Draco and want ff character Draco to grow up to be the sort of person who Felton is in real life. And of course those who liked Draco all along endure in their love believing that Tom Felton has proved them right--that Draco was really a good guy in a terrible situation who becomes kind and funny when removed from all that, or whichever theory they prefer.
