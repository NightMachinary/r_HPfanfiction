Looking at this, I think the influence of Cassandra Claire's /Draco Trilogy/, published between 2000-2006, featuring H/D, H/Hr, D/Hr; as well as her "Big Name Fans" clique, is not to be underestimated. People tend to forget how influential she was on the early HP fandom.

Also interesting to notice is the slight rise of H/Hr in 2014, which seems to correlate with JKR's statements about R/Hr in the Wonderland magazine - widely misinterpreted by the mainstream media as completely endorsing the H/Hr pairing.

H/G seems to be getting a massive rise in popularity rankings in the past year or so, probably due to Cursed Child exposing their relationship more and showing deeper moments between them.

Anyway, great job :)
