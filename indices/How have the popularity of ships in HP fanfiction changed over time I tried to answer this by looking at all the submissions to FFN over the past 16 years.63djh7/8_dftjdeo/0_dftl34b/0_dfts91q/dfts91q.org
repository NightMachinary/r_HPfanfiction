One important thing to keep in mind is that not all these character pairings are ships. While there are undoubtedly a few fics that pair up Fred and George romantically, it most certainly wouldn't find a place in a list of the top 25 most popular ships. Same for Harry and Ron - Harry/Ron isn't a very popular romantic pairing by any means.

Harry and Hermione are also probably higher than they should be, because they have a larger number of gen fics, than Harry and Ginny or Ron and Hermione.

Edit: You actually did include the caveat in your article. Didn't see it, sorry.
