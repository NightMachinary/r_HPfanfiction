I mean we had the whole Matthew Hopkins thing. It's always taught in history classes about how he went travelling to different areas, accused people of witchcraft for various different reasons, each pretty unbelievable, and then set some stupid trials to test them. Granted he wasn't Catholic, but he was Christian.
