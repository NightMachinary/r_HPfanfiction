As people said before, it would need to be AU. In Canon, Muggles and Wizards have 2 separated government the separation during the XVIIe century, also, this separation happened after the king refused to protect the wizards who asked for it.\\
If you were to compare this with an historical (muggle) situation, the wizards revolted for their independances, and if not for their "disparition", their would probably have been a war. It would mean that, with canon situation, a Harry descendant of the royalty would have:

- No claim on Magical Brittain because their are not a monarchy and never been
- Either have no claims of this government because he is either a descendant of a dynastie who came into power after the separation (from what I saw, either Hanovre or Windsor), or he is a descendant of the dynastie who was in power during the separation (Tudor) who "lost" his claim when he left the wizards leave.

But even if you create an AU to make Harry a member of the royal family. Why? The only "interest" I can see to make Harry Muggle royalty would be to make him so kind of symbol and so a target for the Death Eater. But he is already the Boy-Who-Lived and 1st place on Voldemort shit list, and doesn't need this to be at risk. Of course it may also be because it's a mugglewank where wizards are subject of the Muggle crown but I don't really like this kind of fic so not able to really discuss about it.

If you really want to make Harry "noble" or "royal", I think it's way easier to link Harry to Arthur Pendragon to maintain the story in the magical world.
