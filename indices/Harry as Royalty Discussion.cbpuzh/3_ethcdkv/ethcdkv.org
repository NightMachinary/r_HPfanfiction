Harry as royalty should be strictly AU.

Even if he is, a few obliviates are more than enough to eradicate his existence among remaining members of the royal family. Assuming no Muggle wanks in which some ancient treaties with the British royalty could nerf the wizards, Harry as royalty has zip implications on how the war against Voldemort would be fought.

I think there are some in the fandom who still think Muggle bloodlines mean something. But my personal take is that Wizards give a fuck about those things.
