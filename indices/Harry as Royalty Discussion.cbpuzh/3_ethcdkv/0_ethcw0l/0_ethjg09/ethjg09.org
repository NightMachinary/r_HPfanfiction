After SoS, no.

In canon, British wizards didn't have a magical monarch to begin with. They were running their own government, completely independent of Muggles. Therefore, I absolutely don't see why they should give a damn about Muggle royalties.

In other countries though, where we hardly know anything about due to JKR's world building, there could certainly be magical royalties who were once related to their Muggle counterparts when the SoS went into effect. For example, Magical Russia could still be ruled by a Romanov wizard. Or Magical China could have gone through an even bigger civil war between Pureblood monarchists and Muggleborn republicans.
