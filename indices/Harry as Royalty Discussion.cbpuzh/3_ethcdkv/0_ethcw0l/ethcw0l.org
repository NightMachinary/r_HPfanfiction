If I'm understading you right, you don't think wizards would accept a magical Stuart on their throne because of Muggle royal blood. I can underatand that theory, but wouldn't they want at least some continuity in government, even if they had to wait a while?

Speaking of, wouldn't changes to the Muggle timeline (even small ones) be AU for HP purposes?
