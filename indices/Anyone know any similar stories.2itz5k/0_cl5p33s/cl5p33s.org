[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3531310/1/Dark-Respite][Dark Respite:]]A Noir story of HP ass kickery cooked to perfection and served over a savory blend of snarky humor. Before sending Harry to the afterlife, Voldemort told him he'd write the book on worse things than death with him. Harry's back to write the epilogue.

You might like this awesome fic then. It has Salazaar Slytherin living in Harry's mind and acting as a sort of mentor and as you wanted, Harry is much more reluctant to listen to Slytherin compared to Emiya or Meciel.
