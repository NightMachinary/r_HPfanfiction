Yes, so first of all there are numerous very good translations out there. So I would recommend first reading one you already know. I personally just love! Name of the wind or Der Name des Windes in German, though it is quite difficult. Something easier to start with would be the inheritance circle or in German Der Eragon Zyklus. Something original German would be the Tintenherz Trilogie: Tintenherz, Tintenblut, Tintentot. Quite fascinating worldbuilding though geared towards an older teen audience. Another original German work is: Instabil, Die Vergangenheit ist noch nicht Geschehen. That last one is more in the direction of sci-fi and/or urban fantasy. I could probably think of a few more but not at the Moment. Have fun and stay safe!
