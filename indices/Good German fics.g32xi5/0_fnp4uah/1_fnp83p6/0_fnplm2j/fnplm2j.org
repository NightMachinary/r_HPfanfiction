You could read "Tintenherz" or "Reckless" by Cornelia Funke. Also "Die Unendliche Geschichte" or "Momo" by Michael Ende are really good they actually are classical german children books but still awesome to read as an adult! Another great book would be "Das Parf√ºm" allthough it's not fantasy and sometimes quite gruesome.

Hope you like something :) And good look with learning german!!
