I haven't read a fanfic in German in years, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5179143/1/Der-ohnm%C3%A4chtige-Diktator][this]] is one of my favourites:

The premise would probably be /what if all bad fanfictions suddenly came to exist in the Harry Potter universe simultaneously and Voldemort was the only one left who is unaffected/. It's crack, but quite well written.
