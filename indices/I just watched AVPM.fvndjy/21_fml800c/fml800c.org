check out the [[/r/Starkid]] sub! i also definitely recommend watching the rest of their musicals. if you like the AVPM trilogy you might also like Twisted, Ani, Firebringer, Trail to Oregon, and Holy Musical [[mailto:B@man][B@man]]. also check out the Tin Can Brothers and Shipwrecked Comedy- they're groups made up of some of the Starkid actors and just really mcfreakin' fun.
