It's really down to preference. The Potter musical humor in general can be very random, and I can see where it may come off as low effort. I personally find them hilarious, but if you're willing to try something else I would recommend The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals and Black Friday. They're both originals rather than parodies, and they have a more serious overtone as they make fun of certain aspects of horror. Still very in your face comedy and jokes but you might like them more.
