I watched a bit of AVPM, and to be honest I don't see the appeal. The only "joke" I saw that was actually funny at all was Dumbledore complaining about the loss of his ticking sandwich. Most of the "humor" was either low-effort or just random nonsense that made me wonder what the writers were smoking. To this day, I have no idea what the point or humor was supposed to be in the whole "Pigfarts is on Mars" scene with Draco randomly rolling on the floor.

The play "Puffs" was substantially better, IMO.
