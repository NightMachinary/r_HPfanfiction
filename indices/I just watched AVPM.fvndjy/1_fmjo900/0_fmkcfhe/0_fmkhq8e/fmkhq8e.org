There were a ton of great ideas in AVPSY, for sure. It has a few of my favorite jokes in the whole damn trilogy, honestly. And Criss's sincere â€˜take it easy Hogwarts, it has been totally awesome' as he knew that would be the last time on stage with Starkid again outside the odd concert, is heartbreakingly sweet. But you're right, to judge it with their other shows is entirely disingenuous since it was clearly not ready to actually be one.
