In fairness, the 3rd was supposed to be a staged reading before it grew larger and they actually performed, performed it. Considering there was next to no rehearsal (Darren Criss flew in, had a few hours to get almost off book, and flew out right after to film his most intense /Glee/ material at that point), they did a great job. And I enjoyed the meta-ness, and the way they used the final untouched material from the books, and the scene with the ghosts (also the Spiderman stuff). That being said, it was a shame that Bonnie Gruessen wasn't involved.
