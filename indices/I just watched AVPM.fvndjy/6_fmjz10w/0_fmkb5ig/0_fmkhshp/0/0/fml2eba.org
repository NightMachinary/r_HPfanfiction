The guy who didn't like musicals. It's their original production and it's bloody brilliant. It's more horror comedy, kinda? They also have Black Friday which has many characters from TGWDLM, but it's sorta different universe? Time line? There are a lot of theories. StarKid was also making the third one that was supposed to explain it, I think? Anyway, Black Friday is a little more serious, but still has that awesome crack humor.
