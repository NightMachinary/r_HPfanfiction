I've seen every single StarKid musical at least 5 times (excluding Me And My Dick, it's good even with the shit recording, but I'm not the biggest fan), and some 10h livestreams. I adore them so much. If you like AVPM, firstly check the Sequel and Senior Year, of course, secondly you may also like ANI: A Parody (Star Wars parody, they have a live band instead of signing themselves, so they made it with a lot of montages which is so freaking cool), Twisted (Aladdin parody but with a ton of callbacks to other Disney movies and Disney itself), Holy Musical B@tman (I don't have to explain, and it's bloody awesome, best batman ever, it's also a favorite of StarKid writers and most actors), Starship is also pretty nice (kinda sorta Star Trek vibes). The Trail to Oregon and Firebringer are more original productions, but they also rock.

BUT but the most awesome things ever are The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals and Black Friday, which are the original productions in the same universe, more horror parodies than anything else, but are so cool I can't even.
