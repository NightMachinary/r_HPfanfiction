Took me forever to find this fic because of its +stupid+ unique name. For reasons Harry gets sent back in time and ends up becoming a student in hogwarts during its founding, falling in love with Salazar and eventually becoming a sort of teacher's assistant. It's at about that point that merlin comes into the picture, is sorted into Slytherin and ends up relying on Harry as a sort of father figure. The kids act in ways that make sense given the circumstances and Harry becomes a believable role model to them. The author sets themselves up for some really easy Godric bashing, then doesn't indulge in it. Godric's negative traits and beliefs are treated as things that you can't change and should not waste your time complaining about, which was refreshing.

My only complaint is that the story peaked then had a conclusion that lasted way too long (about 10 chapters). If you're looking for stories about merlin or early slytherin house give this one a read, it's wonderful.

And my girlfriend would like [[/r/HPfanfiction]] to know this is her favourite time travel fic.
