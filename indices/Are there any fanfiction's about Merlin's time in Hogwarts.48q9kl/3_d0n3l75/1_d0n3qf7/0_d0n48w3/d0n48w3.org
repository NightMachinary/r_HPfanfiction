It's been a while but if I had to guess the M rating probably exists for 2 reasons.

1. Harry and Salazar have sex and while you never actually see them have sex they do mention what they've been doing at the time to each other. If this kind of language bugs you or makes you feel uncomfortable you can skip it and not miss out on anything the story has to offer.

2. Godric has issues with certain types of people and won't hesitate to use that language to hurt and dehumanize a person. Like I said earlier this could have been used as an excuse to bash and demonize him but instead it's used as a way to give his character depth. The idea being that even though this man is so good and advanced in some ways he does have his blind spots, just like we all do. If this kind of thing makes you uncomfortable then I'll have to recommend you pass on this fic. The language is only used maybe 3-4 times during the entire duration of the fic but it's usually quite important when it's being used and you'll miss out on important plot elements, motivations and events if you skip the passages where that happens.
