I wasn't going to touch on which was more interesting but I disagree now that you bring it up, and most certainly not by a longshot. Just because you move all the effects over to Runes to make it interesting doesn't mean you couldn't have just done that within the canon constraints, which would provide the same depth as fanon Runes offer while leaving Ancient Runes open for some more depth to instead of just changing what subject has what and not adding anything. As for Arithmancy, considering what we know of it and Divination in canon I don't think too many fanon ideas actually go against canon in that regard (other than the obvious “prophecies are BS” fics”)
