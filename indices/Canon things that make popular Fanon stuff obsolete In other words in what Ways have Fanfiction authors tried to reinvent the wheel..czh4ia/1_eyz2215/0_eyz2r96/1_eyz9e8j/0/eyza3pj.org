Except that Rowling is stupidly explicit in that regard.

Fun thing is, there should be no magical Germany since the desire for a unified nation came from the power vacuum left behind by Napoleon. Which gives you countless small states in a loose union, including more than 30 semi-independent city-states. Which would make magical academia more than a little tricky if each gets their own. But then again, Rowling did not think beyond the borders of the UK since the existence of Ireland does not fit the world-building she set up elsewhere.
