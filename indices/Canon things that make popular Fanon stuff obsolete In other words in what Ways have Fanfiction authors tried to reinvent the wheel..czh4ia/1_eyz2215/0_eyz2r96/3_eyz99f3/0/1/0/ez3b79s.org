That is precisely how Rowling describes them.

There is a phenomenon in the fandom of a certain group of anti-Rowling fans deliberately spreading misinformation about Rowling's additions to the canon. I would always encourage people to read the source material rather than listening to the exaggerated and simplified versions spread by people with an agenda.
