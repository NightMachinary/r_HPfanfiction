  Rowling's ramblings are quite clear that there are no other schools, including regional ones. Obviously you can't stop people from teaching on their own, but that's not what I'd call a school, especially since their degrees would not be accepted by many places.

You should probably actually read those "ramblings" before you go around bitching about them...

  There are eleven long-established and prestigious wizarding schools worldwide, all of which are registered with the International Confederation of Wizards. *Smaller and less well-regulated institutions have come and gone, are difficult to keep track of, and are rarely registered* with the appropriate Ministry (in which case, I cannot vouch for the standard of education they might offer). Anyone wishing to know whether there is an approved magical school in their region should address an owl enquiry to the International Confederation of Wizards, Educational Office.
