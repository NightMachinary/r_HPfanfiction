And it's not like Europeans were all that jolly with one another for, like, all of our history.

Not every country needs a massive 1000 year old castle, but I can't see how people from different European countries would go to the same school at 11. From historical to linguistic differences it's a bit too much to have like 3 or 4 schools only.
