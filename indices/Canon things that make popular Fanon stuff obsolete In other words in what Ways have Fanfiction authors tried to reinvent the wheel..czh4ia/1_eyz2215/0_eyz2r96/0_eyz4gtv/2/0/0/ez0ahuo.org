As an example, China made Blizzard turn all exposed bones on its undead models in World of Warcraft into loaves of bread. Because they have rules about how media can portray the undead.

Think about it. Rowling writes about a shadow world with it's own shadow government that operates outside of and in most cases above mundane authority. She'd have to be very careful how she portrays anything involving a Chinese magical government, and from her recent output it's obvious she couoldn't be bothered to be careful.

It's also one of the theories explaining why she's so outspoken about Dumbledore being gay on twitter and in interviews, yet so far the Fantastic Beasts movies have only addressed it tangentially. A ban in China would be terrible for box office takings.
