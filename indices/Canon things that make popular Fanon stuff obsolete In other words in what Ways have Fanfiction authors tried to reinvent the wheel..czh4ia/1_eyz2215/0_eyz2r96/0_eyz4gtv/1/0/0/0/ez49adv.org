You also have to build your own wand, because the sympathetic connection will be much stronger - so you go into the outback, wandless, and come back seven weeks later with a stick made from some strange, unidentifieable wood with a bloody feather, hair, or a spider leg stuck inside. From there, a professional wandmaker turns it into a wand for you to use.

All this happens after the first week, of course.
