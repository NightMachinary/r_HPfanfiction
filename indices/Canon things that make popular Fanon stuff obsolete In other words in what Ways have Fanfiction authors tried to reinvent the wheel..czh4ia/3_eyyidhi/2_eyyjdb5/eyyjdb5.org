The lordship stuff as annoying as it is had no equivalant in canon so it doesn't really count towards what I am looking for. I am more looking for stuff where Fanon has created inferior version of stuff that has apeared in the books.

I actaully prefer the way that quite a few Fanfictions do the Trace after all how mabye times is it now that J. K. Rowling has retconned how the Trace works?

I only saw the First Fantastic beast film and Don't think I am going to see any more of them. Considering all the plot holes she has created threw just the First two Fantastic beast film alone.
