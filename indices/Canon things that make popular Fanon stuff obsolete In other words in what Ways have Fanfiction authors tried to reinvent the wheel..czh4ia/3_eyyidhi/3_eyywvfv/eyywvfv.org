  Canon: Peerage titles and nobility are not part of the wizarding world.
#+end_quote

Whuh? You quote Lupin saying royalty is not part of the wizarding world --- but that doesn't imply anything about peerage. The Wizengamot is basically the wizarding House of Lords, and the Blacks at least claim to be a "noble house".

In fact, "Lord Voldemort" would make more sense if wizarding peerage /did/ exist, because it would mean Riddle was basically 'claiming his heritage. (Without peerage, his title would sound muggle to wizarding ears.)
