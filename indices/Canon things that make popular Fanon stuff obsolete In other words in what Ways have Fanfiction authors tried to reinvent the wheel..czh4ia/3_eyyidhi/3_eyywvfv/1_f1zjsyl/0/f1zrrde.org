  It's not a coincidence that the only wizards known to have noble titles lived before the act of secrecy came into force.

I'm confused. Are you arguing that noble titles are compatible with canon, or not?

  And there is no particular reason to take the Black family claim of being a noble house serious. In fact, Sirius was mocking for precisely such pretensions.

The Blacks call themselves the 'Noble and Most Ancient House of Black'. That's canon: it was on their family tree. Sirius' opinion doesn't really matter (in the same sense that what Prince Charles thinks about the monarchy is irrelevant to its current existence).
