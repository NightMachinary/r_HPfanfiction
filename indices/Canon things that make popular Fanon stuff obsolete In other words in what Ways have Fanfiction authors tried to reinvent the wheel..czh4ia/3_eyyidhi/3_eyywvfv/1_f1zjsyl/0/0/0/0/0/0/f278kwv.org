That the title is no longer used by wizards doesn't mean that it's a muggle title (especially since lord has many connotations outside being a formal title), but rather one that no wizard can reasonably claim. Seems more logical for Voldemort to stand out in this way rather than one used by dozens of wizards in the Wizengamot.
