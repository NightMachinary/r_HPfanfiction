Voldemort's self-declared title actually is a strong argument against the existence of a nobility. Voldemort wanted to stand out and he is hardly going to do that if the whole Wizengamot can claim the same title (though admittedly this title is never used for any member of the Wizengamot). And the "noble" house of Black would be a better argument if it was someone else called them and not how they bragged about themselves.
