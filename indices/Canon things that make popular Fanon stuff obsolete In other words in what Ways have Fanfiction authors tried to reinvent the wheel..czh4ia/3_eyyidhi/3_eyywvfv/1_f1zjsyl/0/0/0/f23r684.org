None of that is really hard evidence against. I'm not saying there /has/ to be peerage, but it's incorrect to say

#+begin_quote
  *Canon*: Peerage titles and nobility are not part of the wizarding world.
#+end_quote

Because the books say nothing on the subject. If anything, the occasional mentions of *Lord* Voldemort, the *Noble* House of Black and the Wizengamot (which per Pottermore is the 'cousin' of the House of Lords) are weak evidence in favour.

I'm fine with either headcanon really.
