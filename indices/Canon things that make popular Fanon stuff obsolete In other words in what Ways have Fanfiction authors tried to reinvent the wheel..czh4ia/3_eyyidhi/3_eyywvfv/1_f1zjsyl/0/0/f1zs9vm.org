  I'm confused. Are you arguing that noble titles are compatible with canon, or not?
#+end_quote

I'm arguing that noble titles existed when wizards were not in hiding and acknowledging the supremacy of the monarch. Now that they no longer do so, there is no recognized authority to grant noble titles.

  The Blacks call themselves the 'Noble and Most Ancient House of Black'. That's canon: it was on their family tree. Sirius' opinion doesn't really matter (in the same sense that what Prince Charles thinks about the monarchy is irrelevant to its current existence).

That they call themselves that doesn't meant that it's a recognized title, rather than something they claim to be.
