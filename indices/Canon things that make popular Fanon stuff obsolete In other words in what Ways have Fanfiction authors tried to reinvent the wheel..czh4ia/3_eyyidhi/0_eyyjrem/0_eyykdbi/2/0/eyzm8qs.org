As a standalone space opera it was good to great. As the middle movie in a Star Wars trilogy it was terrible in the way it cut so many plot threads, or resolved them in ways many fans found unsatisfying. Maybe the MCU has spoilt us for long movie series where the plot and setting has been carefully planned.
