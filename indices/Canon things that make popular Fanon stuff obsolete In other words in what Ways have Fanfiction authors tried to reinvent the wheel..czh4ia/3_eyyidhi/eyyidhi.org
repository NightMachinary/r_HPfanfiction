- *Fanon:* Lordships of the Noble and Most Ancient Houses.

- *Canon:* Peerage titles and nobility are not part of the wizarding world.

  "Because I hated the whole lot of them: my parents, with their pure-blood mania, convinced that to be a Black made you practically royal... my idiot brother, soft enough to believe them... that's him."

  "There are no wizarding princes," said Lupin, now smiling. "Is this a title you're thinking of adopting? I should have thought being the 'Chosen One' would be enough."

Having long, fancy titles ruins the whole idea of Tom Riddle choosing to name himself a "Lord" because he wanted to be special and different. And the reverence people show to Harry, The-Boy-Who-Lived, by bowing to him on the street.

- *Fanon:* The Ministry puts a Trace on all wands sold to 11-year-olds, so Harry has to go to Knockturn Alley to buy a "clean wand" to perform underage magic.

- *Canon:* In Crimes of Grindelwald, JKR came up with [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Admonitor][Admonitors]], magical handcuffs that the Ministry uses to track magic used by the wearer.

  *He flicks his wand once more. Thick metal cuffs -- Admonitors -- appear on DUMBLEDORE'S wrists.*

  *TRAVERS:* From now on, I shall know every spell you cast. I'm doubling the watch on you and you will no longer teach Defence Against the Dark Arts.

The Trace spell is linked directly to the caster, who knows what the monitored person is up to at all times. This wouldn't make sense in fanon, where there have to be a hundred Ministry workers who presumably have to keep track of thousands of children's wands, 24/7.

Actually, now that I'm re-reading the script, JKR fucks up her own canon with Crimes of Grindelwald.

  *NEWT:* Appare vestigium.

  *The tracking spell materialises as a swirl of gold, which illuminates traces of recent magical activity in the square.*

  *NEWT climbs onto the case and inspects impressions of creatures revealed in the air, while the now trained adult Niffler sniffs out clues.*

If they had a spell in 1927 to magically track the movements of creatures, you'd think that Dumbledore would use it at Hogwarts to catch the basilisk. But for most of Chamber of Secrets, everyone thought that a dark wizard was casting dark spells to petrify the students.
