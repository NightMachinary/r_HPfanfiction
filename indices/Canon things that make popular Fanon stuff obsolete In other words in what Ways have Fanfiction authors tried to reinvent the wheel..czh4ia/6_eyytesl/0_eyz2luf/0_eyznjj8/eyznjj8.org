Harry usually doesn't murder them. Instead, he let them just beat him like a slave who doesn't know what self-defense is. It's the same Harry who is brave to face off Tom Riddle, Dementors, a dragon and Basilisk.

Then, there's the Harry who forgives them and even give them millions to "fix" things between.

And there's the wimp Harry who's afraid of his own shadow. Everything is his fault. Therefore, it's his fault if the Dursleys hate him.
