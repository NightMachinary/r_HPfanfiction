I think we see that during the Weighing of the Wands, where Ollivander notes that he doesn't use Veela hair, even though he okays it and performs some magic with it.

There's also [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wand#Wands_and_wandlore][a list]] of various materials used, many of which Ollivander doesn't use but which seem to perform well (including Wampus hair).
