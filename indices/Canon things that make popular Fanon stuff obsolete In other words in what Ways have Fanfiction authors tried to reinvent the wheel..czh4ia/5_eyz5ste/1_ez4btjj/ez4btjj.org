We know that there are other wand cores that work just as well, if not better than the three Ollivander's uses. There's an american wandmaker that uses Thunderbird feathers, for example. The Elder Wand has a thestral hair as a core. Salzar Slytherin had a horn from his basilisk.

Apart from that, your connection to the animal it came from is probably important as well, for example, if your animagus form is a thunderbird, one of your own feathers would probably make an incredible wand core.
