At war people often have to do highly immoral things in order to win or just survive. The things they don't want to talk about after. Therefore “he didn't tell Hermione and Sirius that he and Dumbledore used highly-illegal blood magic to kill Voldemort” is exactly the same as “didn't want to talk about his war experiences”.
