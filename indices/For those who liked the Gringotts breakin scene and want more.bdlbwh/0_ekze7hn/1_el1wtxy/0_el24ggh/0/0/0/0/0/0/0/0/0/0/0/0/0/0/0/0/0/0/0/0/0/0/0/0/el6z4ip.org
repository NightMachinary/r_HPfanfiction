The funny thing is that in this story, Hermione has a strict "don't kill" rule. All she does is stealing money from the rich and corrupt - and, as was told in the story as well, her victims were still pretty well off afterwards - far richer than the Weasleys, for example.

But, hey, she's Hermione, so of course she's the monster - and not Sirius, who told her to keep Harry in the dark and killed far more easily, or Harry, who racked up a large body count himself. Or Dumbledore, who taught Harry blood magic so he could kill Voldemort. Or Malfoy, who hired a blood mage to protect his money with human sacrifices.
