  This is a huge flaw in almost all Sarfox's world buildings. If purebloods have absolute power in the Magical Britain, why did they follow Riddle? If Riddle wanted power, it was more reasonable for him to start uprising of muggleborns.

First, in my stories, the purebloods usually don't have the absolute power - that's reserved for a small clique of "Old Families" with inherited seats in the Wizengamot. The vast majority of the purebloods doesn't have a say in how the country's run, although many of them can exert some influence through an Old Family head related to them. Roman-style client/patron system.

And even those in the Wizengamot were not united - some of them not only wanted more power than they had, they also wanted to prevent Dumbledore's reforms since those were eroding their power. And among those people Voldemort recruited his followers - in addition to those purebloods who wanted more power and had none or not much. As the Dark Lord, he could counter Dumbledore.
