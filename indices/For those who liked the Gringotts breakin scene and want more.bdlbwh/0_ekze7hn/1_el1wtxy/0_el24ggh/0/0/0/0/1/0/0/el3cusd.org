Wow, you really are bent on ignoring everything. The story clearly shows that the system isn't working, and that in order to reform and clean it up, you need to break the power of the oligarchy running things.

But hey, you'll keep sprouting your misogynist lies about how it's all evil Hermione and everyone else is useless.

And all because Hermione kept a secret from Harry - on the orders of Sirius. But since that wouldn't fit your narrative about everything being her fault, you keep ignoring that.
