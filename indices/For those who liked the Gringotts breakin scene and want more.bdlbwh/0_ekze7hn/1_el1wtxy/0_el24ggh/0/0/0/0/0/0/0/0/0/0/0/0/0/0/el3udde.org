  You still haven't explained why Dumbledore's deal binds Hermione, by the way, which was the original point.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore is her superior and main representative of the Light side.

Going after Malfoy after the deal is direct betrayal of Dumbledore. If she puts her personal feelings above the fact that the war ended and many lives are saved because of Malfoy, she's selfish bitch.

The law about prohibiting stealing from others is unjust? When did he call to fight with injustice with violence and thieving?
