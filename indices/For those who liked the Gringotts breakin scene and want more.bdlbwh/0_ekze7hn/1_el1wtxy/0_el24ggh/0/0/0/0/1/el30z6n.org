Dumbledore had a deal with Malfoy to defeat Voldemort. That included a pardon. But Dumbledore was barely dead when Malfoy went back to his old tricks, manipulating the Ministry and blocking reforms. Dozens of chapters show how cancerous Malfoy's influence was, and how Harry's attempts to clean up the Ministry didn't work in the face of inherent corruption.
