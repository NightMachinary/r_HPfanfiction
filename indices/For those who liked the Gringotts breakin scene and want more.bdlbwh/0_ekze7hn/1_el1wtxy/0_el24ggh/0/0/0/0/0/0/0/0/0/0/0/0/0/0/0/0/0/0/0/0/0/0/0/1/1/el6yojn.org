Wow, you really are delusional. "Go into politics and fight him there"? They tried that, as anyone who had actually read the story would know. It wasn't working since the system was not working.

Also, your lies are really pathetic. Malfoy attacked Hermione straight after Dumbledore's death. Hermione and Sirius had all the reasons to go after him after their attempts to clear Hermione's name were foiled. Which was a crime.
