If you were going to dismiss the whole discussion---including the parts that you had brought up---and just repeat your talking points, I wish you'd done that 20 posts ago, before I wasted time actually engaging with your arguments and treating you like an intelligent, well-intentioned individual who was merely (from my point of view) misguided and/or misinformed.

As it, is, well, congratulations: you've successfully persuaded me that [[/u/Starfox5]] is correct: you are either unintelligent or malicious, so dead-set against Hermione that you are willing to contradict the fic's author about what actually happened in the fic and throw logic, morality, and ethics out of the window in order to have a reason to condemn a fictional character.

You should consider reflecting a bit---ask yourself whether participating in the fanfic community might be making you a worse person. A break from the fandom might be to your own benefit and everyone else's.
