You ignore the issue - you call Hermione a hypocrite, but not Harry. Even though he claims to want to reform the Ministry within the bounds of law - after breaking the law himself more than once (Veritsaerum, Blood Magic).

It's very much clear that you are fixated on Hermione, and ignore everything that doesn't fit your warped narrative.
