  But Hermione isn't a state, she is a person.
#+end_quote

States are just groups of persons who agreed to call themselves a state and who got a bunch of other persons to agree to call them a state. There is nothing magical about the distinction.

  With your logic if a person A commits a crime against a person B and then the government punishes him for that or finds innocent or pardons , the B (or relatives) can still go after A. This is totally against all rules of society. It's a serious crime that must be punished for.

What if that government were set up in such a way that no matter what A did to B (perhaps short of grievous bodily harm, but perhaps not even then), the government would /always/ pardon A? Would you accept that under those circumstances, B would, in fact, have the right to retaliate against A?

Because, that's pretty much the situation Hermione (B) was in with respect to Lucius (A). As I wrote several posts upthread, by systematically failing to protect her rights, the Ministry has lost moral authority over Hermione, and Hermione's right to punish those who have violated her rights has reverted to her.

  So what? To kill a monster you have to become a monster?
#+end_quote

You seem to treat law as sacrosanct. I am merely reminding you that law is itself a function of who wrote it. And, yes, sometimes to kill a monster, you have to become a monster. The question is, can you stop being a monster afterwards?
