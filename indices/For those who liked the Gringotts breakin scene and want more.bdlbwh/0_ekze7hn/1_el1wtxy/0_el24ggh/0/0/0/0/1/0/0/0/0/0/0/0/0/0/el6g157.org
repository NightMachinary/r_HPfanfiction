The Harry's goal through the story was becoming an Auror and to change the Ministry from inside. He became one and met the same reality all Juniors meet: world isn't strictly black and white, there are both written and unwritten rules how the system works. Most Juniors learn how to work with the system and remain good (with your own words), but Harry got frustrated and failed. His greatest accomplishments are killings of several people. That's all.

Yes, in my eyes he is a failure in your story.

He also a failure as his own person: for all years of their friendship how many times did he confront Hermione when he disagreed with her?
