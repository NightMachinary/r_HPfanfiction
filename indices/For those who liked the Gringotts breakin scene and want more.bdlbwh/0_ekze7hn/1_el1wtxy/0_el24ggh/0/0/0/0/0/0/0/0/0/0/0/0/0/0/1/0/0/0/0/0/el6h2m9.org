If you're talking about crimes, it was Hermione who refused the truth serum. She could easily prove that she didn't steal anything. Why didn't she do it? May be because she didn't want to be punished for a more serious crime she did commit?

Yes, her actions saved Harry's life, but still she assaulted with the truth serum (which is unethical in the core) another minor instead of going to Dumbledore.

She is using human rights to justify her actions and at the same time she is rejecting the same right for the people she doesn't like. This is hypocrisy.
