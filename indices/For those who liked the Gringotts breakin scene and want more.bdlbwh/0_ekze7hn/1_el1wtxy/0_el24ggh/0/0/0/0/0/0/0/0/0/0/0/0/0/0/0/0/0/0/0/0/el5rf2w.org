I provided the real world analogy of the deal Dumbledore made with Malfoy.

You don't want to accept it, it's your write and I have nothing to add.

I believe in the presumption of innocence. Mental arguments like “you are guilty, because there's no way you aren't guilty even if we can't prove it” lead to corruption and chaos.

Unlike the case with Lucius we have all evidence of Hermione breaking the law with the only purpose of having her revenge.

Again we don't have any evidence against Malfoy. Yes, he is a shitty person and have opposite political views, but it's not a crime.
