There's nothing philosophical here.

With your logic from the moral standpoint Dumbledore shouldn't have made the deal with Lucius, the war should have continued and more innocents should have died.

If the Ministry is totally corrupted, replacing some figures won't change anything, because others are equally corrupted.

If there are good people there, then unite with them and fight for your ideas on political field.

Putting yourself and your moral above the law is wrong from any standpoint.

Moral doesn't scale. Often you have to make compromises in order to achieve something better.
