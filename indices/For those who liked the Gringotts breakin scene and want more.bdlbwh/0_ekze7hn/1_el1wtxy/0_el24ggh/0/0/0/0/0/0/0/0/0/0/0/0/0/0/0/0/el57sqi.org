  hy does Lucius Malfoy, a Death Eater---a terrorist, a torturer, and a murderer---a perpetrator and perpetuator of corruption and injustice, who only worked against Voldemort for selfish reasons, who is in no way reformed, and who escaped just punishment by any meaningful definition of justice, deserve to be dealt with in good faith? Why is it wrong to betray him once he's outlived his usefulness?

Nazis started similarly: at some point they decided that some people have less rights than them.

You can't fight for equality and law if you put yourself above and some people below it.

Besides what evidence points that Malfoy killed anyone and he wasn't just Riddle's accountant?
