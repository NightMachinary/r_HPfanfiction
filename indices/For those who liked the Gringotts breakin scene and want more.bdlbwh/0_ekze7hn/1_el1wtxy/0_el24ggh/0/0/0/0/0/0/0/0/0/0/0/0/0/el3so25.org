  Lucius is evil. Making a deal with evil is morally wrong.
#+end_quote

I never said that. Where are you getting this?

You still haven't explained why Dumbledore's deal binds Hermione, by the way, which was the original point.

  40% of uncorrupted Ministry workers. Working together under proper leadership they could easily overrule other 60% corrupted using “anti-Riddle” propaganda as the war had just ended. You stated that 40% are still good people. Nothing stops from uniting with them.

OK, let me try to be more clear. In Wizengamot, a 40% block (say) can't outvote a 60% block without breaking that block. If the 60% block is held together in part by Lucius's bribes, then it makes sense that impoverishing Lucius will facilitate breaking it. Then, if Lucius no longer being able to pay but Sirius still having unlimited funds, Sirius can now persuade or bribe his way to 50%+1 and enact the reforms, convict purebloods guilty of crimes, fire corrupt Ministry officials, etc.. It's been a while since I read the fic, so I am probably not remembering all the factors involved, but that's the gist of it.

  This is a huge flaw in almost all Sarfox's world buildings. If purebloods have absolute power in the Magical Britain, why did they follow Riddle? If Riddle wanted power, it was more reasonable for him to start uprising of muggleborns.

You'll have to ask [[/u/Starfox5]] about that. My sense is that with Dumbledore around, they were losing ground nonetheless, because having an uberwizard on your side matters.

  The war ended. There was no genocide. In post war period I would choose Martin Luther King, Jr.

I'm glad we agree. In the immortal words of Martin Luther King Jr in his Letter from a Birmingham Jail, "One has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws."
