Don't you have even slight understanding of logic?

I already told what I think about Harry. There's no point in bringing him again and again to make Hermione look good (even if it's your favorite device).

This is story about Hermione and that's why we're talking about Hermione.

I conclude that you have nothing to say and therefore I'm finishing with it.
