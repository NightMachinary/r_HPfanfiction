Hermione and Sirius went after Malfoy after Malfoy sabotaged their attemtps to exonerate Hermione. That happened after Dubmledore's death. That wasn't a betrayal of Dumbledore's deal since, as [[/u/turbinicarpus]] stated, it was Malfoy who committed a new offense/crime after his pardon. Dumbledore msot certainly didn't intend to have Malfoy be untouchable forever, so it wasn't a betrayal at all.

If stealing someone's money is the best working way to stop them from oppressing others, it's the moral thing to do.
