  The only thing Malfoy did to Hermione after the war is that he didn't make her innocent. But he wasn't obligated to do it. Also he was crucial in stopping the war. You were keeping ignoring this points.

Wow, once again, you lie. Malfoy didn'r just "not make her innocent" - he straight-out sabotaged Sirius's move to clear her name. That's the difference between not helping someone and assaulting them.

  Fight with a corrupted government is a very long term project. Yet the heroes didn't see immediate results and decided that they are above the law. Especially after Sirius failed to use political potential of anti-Riddle movement and Malfoy (Riddle's high ranked ex-officer) managed to use pro-Riddle movement.

Sirius very much used all the momentum of the Anti-Voldemort movement. But, and once again you prove you actually haven't read the story, or make up lies, as a publically hailed hero in the fight against Voldemort, Malfoy actually used the ANTI-Voldemort movement himself, and quite effectively. Hell, the fact that everyone knew Malfoy had risked his life as a spy for Dumbledore was one of the reasons political moves were not enough to dislodge him.

  I'm living in a country with very corrupted government. I see with my own eyes how it works and how the opposition works. The way Starfox wrote about it is huge joke and the straight way to a disaster.

Unless your country actually is run by an aristocracy where anyone but about two dozen people have no legal way to influence the government, your experience means shit. In this Wizarding Britain, the Wizengamot is the highest authority, both for legislative and judiciary concerns, and controls teh Ministry - and it's made up of inherited seats. Which means if you control the majority of the Wizengamot, you control the country. And that means ruining (financially and through loss of face) half a dozen Wizengamot members is a viable way to take control of the country. Much less violent than a coup, and much, much more effective than trying to push reforms which would reduce the power and influence and therefore the security and safety of the very people who are needed to vote for it.

Or, in other words: "Hey, why don't you vote for a real democracy where the Wizengamot is elected and can't make up any law it wants and micro-manage the Ministry to promote their family members" isn't and won't ever be a very popular movement in the Wizengamot. It's not impossible to push it through if you have a lot of money, influence, a reputation as both a hero against Voldemort and a member of the darkest family in Britain and suppotr from a lot of people outside the Wizenagmot for that "we can always fight a war" implication, but you won't manage that if you're facing a man with lots of gold, lots of rich allies, an even better reputation as a hero, and a past as a Death Eater since that pretty much neutralises you and your goals run counter to the selfish interests of the Wizengamot.

So, yeah, your real life experiences mean shit because you're trying to apply them to a completely different system.
