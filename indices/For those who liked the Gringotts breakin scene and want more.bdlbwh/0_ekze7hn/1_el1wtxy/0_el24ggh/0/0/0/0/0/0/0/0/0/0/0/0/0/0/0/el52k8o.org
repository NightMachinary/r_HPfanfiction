Again, this "Light side" thing is something that you made up. Hermione and Sirius are not Dumbledore's subordinates, and he does not represent them and cannot forgive anyone on their behalf.

Even supposing that he does represent them and can forgive on their behalf, so what? Suppose that we say that Hermione and Sirius betrayed poor little Lucius. Why does Lucius Malfoy, a Death Eater---a terrorist, a torturer, and a murderer---a perpetrator and perpetuator of corruption and injustice, who only worked against Voldemort for selfish reasons, who is in no way reformed, and who escaped just punishment by any meaningful definition of justice, deserve to be dealt with in good faith? Why is it wrong to betray him once he's outlived his usefulness?

  The law about prohibiting stealing from others is unjust? When did he call to fight with injustice with violence and thieving?

Irrelevant. You wrote:

  Putting yourself and your moral above the law is wrong from any standpoint.

I pointed out that your purported moral model urged exactly that.
