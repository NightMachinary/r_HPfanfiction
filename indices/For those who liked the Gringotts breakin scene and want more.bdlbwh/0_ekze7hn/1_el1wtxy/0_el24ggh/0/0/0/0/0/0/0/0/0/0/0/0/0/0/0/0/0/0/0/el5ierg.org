  The first part when they at war. They follow Dumbledore's orders and plans.

That makes them allies, not subordinates.

  The example with kidnappers is wrong.

  The more correct one is when charges against a member of a criminal organization are dropped for his/her assistance to get the "bigger fish". After that no one goes after him/her. Moreover often the government provides witness protection.

  This is exactly what happened with Malfoy.

Again, not the point. The point is that bargains and deals aren't sacrosanct. And, even your analogy depends on the government's authority to pardon someone on everyone's behalf. For reasons I have amply discussed upthread, neither Dumbledore nor the Ministry have this authority with respect to Hermione.

Even within your analogy, if this turned mafioso continues committing crimes after his pardon---as Lucius had---not only can he prosecuted for the new crimes, often he can be prosecuted for the old ones as well.

  Now you are convincing a person without any evidence just because you don't like him.
#+end_quote

Don't confuse intellectual humility with a concession. Even if we suppose that he never personally cursed anyone, he's been Voldemort's political cover and financier for two decades, and is therefore responsible for more death than any rank-and-file DE mook.

I also note that you haven't gainsaid any of my other charges against Lucius. Even if he is innocent of direct murder, the rest are plenty to justify treating him in bad faith.

Speaking of not liking someone, you seem to be awfully eager to convict Hermione and degrade and infantilise her motivations. Have you considered reflecting on that?

  Once again, Nazis started similarly.

Mate, you're the one on the blood supremacists' side here.
