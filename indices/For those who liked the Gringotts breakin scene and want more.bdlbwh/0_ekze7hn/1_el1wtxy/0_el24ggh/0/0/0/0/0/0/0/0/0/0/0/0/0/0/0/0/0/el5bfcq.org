  The story explicitly states that Hermione and a Sirius are Dumbledore's subordinates.

Explicitly, huh? Direct quote or it didn't happen.

  Nazis started similarly: at some point they decided that some people have less rights than them. You can't fight for equality and law if you put yourself above and some people below it.

It seems to me that by your logic, if a gang of kidnappers holds up their end of the bargain and releases the hostages, we are morally obligated to not just to pay them their ransom but to not try to arrest them afterwards.

Now, it is, indeed, wrong to give someone less moral consideration because of their birth---their race/ethnicity or magicalness of their parents. That's what the Nazis, Voldemort, and Lucius did. It is, however, not wrong to give someone less moral consideration because their actions or the content of their character.

  Besides what evidence points that Malfoy killed anyone and he wasn't just Riddle's accountant?

I don't remember if there have been scenes of the sort in the fic, so we don't know either way. But, whether he did it himself or knowingly and deliberately helped others do it, his degree of culpability isn't that different. Also, in many criminal organisations, an initiate is asked to commit a murder or comparably heinous crime, to prove that they are not a spy and to make it harder for them to switch sides. To me, it feels like a very Voldemort thing to do, as well.
