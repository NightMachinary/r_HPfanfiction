Harry killed Voldemort, Barty Crouch Jr and the Lestranges, saving countless people from their attacks. But since he didn't also change the Ministry, he's a failure in your opinion.

It's clear that as long as Hermione manages to do anything (or Sirius, whom you keep ignoring) and doesn't mindlessly follow and pobey Harry, you'll keep sprouting drivel about how Harry sucks.
