As I've shown in the story which you obviously haven't read, the Ministry is controlled by the Wizengamot. If you control the Wizengamot, you can change the Ministry. But in order to control the Wizengamot, you need to break Malfoy and his cronies' power. And that means destroying their wealth and reputation.

And again - you keep focusing on Hermione, totally ignoring that she's part of a group led by Sirius. It's Sirius who calls the shots, finances everything and leads the political campaign.

And now you are whining that the story I wrote isn't pandering to your misogynist views. Pathetic.
