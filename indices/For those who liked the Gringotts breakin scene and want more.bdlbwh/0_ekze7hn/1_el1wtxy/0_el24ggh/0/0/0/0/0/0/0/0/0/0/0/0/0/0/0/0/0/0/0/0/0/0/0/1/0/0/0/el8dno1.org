No, not insults: what I gave you was my honest assessment of your character based on your observable actions, along with sincere suggestions driven by goodwill towards you. If you want to improve the assessment, improve your observable actions.

Anyway, your penultimate post was just repeating your old points, and your last post has things that I believe I had, in fact, addressed at some point in the thread (or [[/u/Starfox5]] had), so I am done.

On a more personal note, I am genuinely saddened to hear about the situation in your country, and I sincerely hope that it improves over time by methods of which you would approve. I think that I can now appreciate a little better where you are coming from: in a RL Muggle country like yours, tactics like those used by Hermione and Sirius would likely make things worse, not better.

Interestingly, [[/u/Starfox5]] has a fic linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13072492/1/Democracy]]), in which he describes a process that is more like what you seem to favour.
