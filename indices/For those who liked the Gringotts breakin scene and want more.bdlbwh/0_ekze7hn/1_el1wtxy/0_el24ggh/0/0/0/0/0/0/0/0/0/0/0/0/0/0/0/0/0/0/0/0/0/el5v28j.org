I am happy to accept your analogy. Like I said, the mafioso (Lucius) turned state's evidence for one state (Dumbledore + Ministry) and was pardoned. However, another state against which he had committed a crime (Hermione) never pardoned him and chose to prosecute him anyway. In addition, Lucius continued committing crimes and could also be held culpable for those.

And, ultimately, this type of deal is explicitly foregoing justice in pursuit of greater justice. If you were able to both get the evidence against the boss /and/ punish the underboss, it would be better than punishing just the boss. So, based on your analogy, defeating Voldemort /and/ punishing Lucius is better than just defeating Voldemort.

So, your analogy isn't doing what you think it's doing.

​

The presumption of innocence argument might make sense inside the story, but we are not holding a trial for Lucius here. We are trying to infer what probably happened in the fic but wasn't explicitly on screen, and the preponderance of evidence is that Lucius is guilty of everything I had listed. That said, we could just ask [[/u/Starfox5]], but I don't think you'd like his answer.

> Yes, he is a shitty person and have opposite political views, but it's not a crime.

Even leaving aside that he used criminal means to promote his "political views" throughout, and that he never hesitated to work outside the system to promote his "political views", this sounds like another argument that just because something it's lawful it's good, and just because something is unlawful it's bad. We've already been over this.

Since you like bringing up the Nazis so much, remember: everything they did after coming to power was completely lawful.
