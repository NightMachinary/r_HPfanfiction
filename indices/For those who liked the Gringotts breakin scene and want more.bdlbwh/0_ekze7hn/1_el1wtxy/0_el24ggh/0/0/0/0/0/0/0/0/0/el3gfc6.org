OK, let's get philosophical.

Firstly, "Light side" exists in fanon, not in canon nor in this fanfic. Even if we suppose, for the sake of argument, that by betraying Voldemort---to protect himself and his own family, not for any altruistic reason---Lucius had, in Dumbledore's eyes, atoned for framing Hermione, corrupting the political system, treason, all of the support he had given Voldemort before turning on him, as well as what torture and murder he had personally committed while wearing the Death Eater mask, why is Hermione bound by Dumbledore's bargain?

Secondly, Hermione's initial expulsion and all subsequent events, including after Voldemort's defeat, showed that the wizard government was profoundly corrupt and systemically unjust even without Voldemort. As a result, it had lost its moral right to impose its monopoly on violence on those whose rights it was failing to protect---Hermione in particular. The right to retaliate against violence---normally yielded to the government---thus reverted to Hermione, as did the right to change the government outside the government's set procedures.

Thirdly, even if we suppose, again, for the sake of argument, that Lucius's betrayal truly gave him a moral blank slate, by continuing to work to perpetuate the unjust government Lucius and his allies were committing new crimes, crimes that were not covered by the bargain.
