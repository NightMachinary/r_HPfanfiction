Let's not continue this "what if and let's suppose". We have what the story has.

Dumbledore and Malfoy had a deal that stopped the war. Hermione didn't like it and decided to get her own way.

There's no evidence against Malfoy.

Yes, he's a shitty person, but again it's not a crime.

Don't want him in power? Go into politics and fight him there.
