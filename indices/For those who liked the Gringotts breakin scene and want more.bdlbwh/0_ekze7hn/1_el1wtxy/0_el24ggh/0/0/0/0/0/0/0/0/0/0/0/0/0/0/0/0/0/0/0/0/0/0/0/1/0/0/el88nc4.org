Personal insults too?

​

I gave you a flaw in your logic. Your answer started with "What if ...". As I said before personal thoughts and suspicions are not the proof of guilt.

The only thing Malfoy did to Hermione after the war is that he didn't make her innocent. But he wasn't obligated to do it. Also he was crucial in stopping the war. You were keeping ignoring this points.

[Edit]: also for almost everyone during the war Hermione was sitting in the library and waiting while others do the job risking with with their lives. Even from the 3rd standpoint I don't see any reason why a convicted thief should be cleared.

​

Fight with a corrupted government is a very long term project. Yet the heroes didn't see immediate results and decided that they are above the law. Especially after Sirius failed to use political potential of anti-Riddle movement and Malfoy (Riddle's high ranked ex-officer) managed to use pro-Riddle movement.

Author's words outside of the story mean nothing. We're taking about the story, not about author's notes.

I'm living in a country with very corrupted government. I see with my own eyes how it works and how the opposition works. The way Starfox wrote about it is huge joke and the straight way to a disaster.
