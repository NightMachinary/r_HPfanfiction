Harry "didn't want to talk about his war experiences" actually was "he didn't tell Hermione and Sirius that he and Dumbledore used highly-illegal blood magic to kill Voldemort", so he can't complain too much about not being told that Sirius and Hermione robbed Malfoy's cronies blind to break their political power. (And you still refuse to acknowledge that Hermione would have told him, but Sirius forbade it because he thought it would destroy Harry's dream of being an Auror by forcing him to either protect them as an Auror, or join them as a thief.)

Hermione doesn't use anything special that others can't use. She was taught all she knows by Fletcher, and she had had to be saved by Sirius and was almost caught by Harry or fell into a trap during her heists. She is one of the best Curse-Breakers, though, since that's what she focused on - though not as experienced as Fletcher. (And, once again, Harry outclassing almost all Aurors apparently is a-ok in your book - double standards much?)

Harry a total failure? He personally killed Voldemort. He fought and killed, with Ron, Barty Crouch Jr. and the Lestrades. He caught Umbridge. And he deduced correctly, once he had the right clue, that Hermione and Sirius were the robbers he was chasing. (And he stomped her in their duel.) If that's a total failure, I don't want to know what you think is a victory.

Really, you keep lying about my story just because you think Harry should have never forgiven Hermione for keeping a secret from him - on his godfather's orders, no less! (The same guy who, in canon, named his son after two men who kept far worse secrets from him.) And while he himself kept an at least as serious secret from everyone.
