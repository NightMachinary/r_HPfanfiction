Opposite opinion.

While the writing is better than average the story's only purpose is to make Hermione into another Merlin. Take an average OP!Harry story, replace him with Hermione and you'll get the same.

The world and magical system are built with it in mind (when only Hermione has and is allowed to use some powerful tools and magic). All raids are designed for her to succeed without many difficulties.

Harry's character is destroyed to a total failure in everything and a doormat without his own opinion.

All other characters are just plot devices.

And the line about that war veterans are deserved to be lied and deceived by their friends and families, because they don't want to talk about their war experiences, is totally disgusting.
