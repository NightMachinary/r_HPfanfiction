I read this early in my HP fanfiction career, so about four years ago. For the record it is complete and utter shit. It's not popular because it's amazing, it's popular because its a complete HHr filled with bashing, cliches, bad tropes, fix it, and plot armor for all the important characters; it's a feel good fic.

--------------

So to answer some of your questions I ended up rereading a few paragraphs. I would have dropped this instantly.

*Houses:* Harry & Hermione are in Ravenclaw

*Pairings:* Don't remember beyond HHr

*Bashing:* Literally everyone.

So Robst likes to write in a very particular way, as a result of this I'd argue he is literally bashing every character in some way, but I'll summarize:

The Malfoys get fucked hard early on and become irrelevant if memory serves, I'm pretty sure it bashes Snape and the Weasleys as the author is Robst.

The entire plot of this is basically "Bash Dumbledore." The first time he really talks and isn't just rehashing canon it managed to trip my bashing flag. At a point Robst gets rid of Dumbledore and then brings him back as the Deputy Headmaster of Dumstrang so he can bash him more.

Have I mentioned the author of this was Robst yet? Well he is. That means Hermione will at some point kiss Harry and become soul-bonded to him as a direct result, usually around or before she turns 12 (less than a month after they meet.) She will then become some chibi!Bellatrix Lestrange where Harry is her Voldemort, he can do no wrong. She's basically his willing slave at this point, also there will be an arbitrary point where they decide they're old enough to have sex and tell the adults not to worry until then.

So Super!+Edgy+Dark!Indy!Harry's are technically Harry bashings, well this is the /Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion/ of Harry bashings. There is no way to conceivably top the bashing of Harry's character in this story, if anyone came close the universe would literally implode.

If I haven't managed to convey it yet, Robst writes Harry Potter fiction using only OCs who happen to bear the names and some of the roles of the canon cast.

*What did I like most about it:* I don't remember nor do I want to.

*What did I dislike most about it:* At the time of reading, who knows? Now: Everything.

If you really want a Goblin raised Harry you should probably [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7s2jnw/harry_crow_questions/dt2lfjp/][read the story Achille-Talon linked below]] or make a thread requesting that. I imagine that would be difficult as for whatever reason you deleted your account sometime between when I started typing this and shortly after I posted this.
