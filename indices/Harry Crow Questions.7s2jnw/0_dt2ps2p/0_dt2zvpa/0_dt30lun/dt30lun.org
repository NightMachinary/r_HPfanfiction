  [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7s2jnw/harry_crow_questions/dt2lfjp/][read the story Achille-Talon linked below]]

I was referring to the story [[/u/Achille-Talon][u/Achille-Talon]] linked, /Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone/. At the time it was the only other comment and I thought it was clear enough. I've edited it for increased clarity.
