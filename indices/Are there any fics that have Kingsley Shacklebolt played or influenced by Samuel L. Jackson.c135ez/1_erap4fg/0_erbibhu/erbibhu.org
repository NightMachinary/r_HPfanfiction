Pulp Fiction and Harry Potter crossover... Ron could play the boxer, with a goblin mob boss, Fleur as the boss' girlfriend, Kingsley as the BAMF, maybe instead of Albus as his partner, put Aberforth in (he is the owner of the Hog's Head)... hmmm, Harry and Hermione as the robbers?

Meh, there's quite a few kinks to work out but that would be highly entertaining!
