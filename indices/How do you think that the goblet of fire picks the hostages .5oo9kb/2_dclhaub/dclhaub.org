While I don't think the Goblet chooses the hostages, I think it's fine if you wish to make it so in your story. It's your story after all.

I'm fairly certain Fleur's little sister wasn't actually there, not really a reason for her to. We don't see anyone's family in it after all, so maybe goa different path. Maybe the Goblet can magically access who's the person they've thunk a about more ever since selected. That ads up, since Cedric would most likely have been thinking about his new girlfriend a whole lot, Viktor was basically stalking Hermione at one point, and you can spin it as Fleur actually not having that many close friends at beauxbattons because all the girls are terribly jealous of her and the boys can't mantain a conversation for mroe than two words, so she thinks of her family a whole lot.

And Harry, well, we were in Harry's head, I'm pretty sure we can all attest Ron Weasley was the main subject in his head. So I think it fits. If this is who you wish to change, then simply make Ron never leave Harry after his name coming out, have them reconcile sooner, have Harry not care about the "break up" for one reason or another.
