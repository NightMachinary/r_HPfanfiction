That is a fair point. Perhaps the contract, drawn up by three ministries and their respective school Heads, stipulates the criteria for eligible hostages and, lacking other options, Igor had to choose Hermione because she was the only one that fit?

It's that or the Goblet chooses the eligible hostage (using the same criteria as last paragraph) and the Headmaster or Mistress is only to obey.

I know which one I prefer.
