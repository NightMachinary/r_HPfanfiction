I don't see a real canon reason as to why Karkaroff wouldn't let Hermione be the choice. The dude pretty much does anything and everything to make sure Krum is happy. Do you think Karkaroff is going to risk getting on Krum's bad side by importing a random girl Krum doesn't care about from Durmstrang? And, it's not like Karkaroff is going to go up to Dumbledore and say Hermione cannot be Krum's pick because she's English and a Mudblood.

So yeah, I'm of the opinion that the goblet had nothing to do with who was picked as hostages for that task.
