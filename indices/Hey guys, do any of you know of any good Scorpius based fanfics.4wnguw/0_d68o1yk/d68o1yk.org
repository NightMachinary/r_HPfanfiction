- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=179718][peppersweet]] writes great Scorpius/Malfoy family stories. I was actually talking to her about how similar some of our headcanons are to CC. Any of them are great. For something light, try Starving Artists (though it's also her older writing). She's the only one I know with complete fic that features a CC-like Scorpius and shaped my headcanon of him.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=307670][An Improbable Fiction]] - Hugo-centric feat. Scorpius and Professor Neville on an adventure into the Forbidden Forest. Light and friendshippy.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=272808][Al Potter and his Very Epic Plan]] - Albus is willingly in Slytherin in this one. Also cute and friendshippy.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294543][And Capers Ensue]] - mine; ensemble heist-comedy with Scorpius as second lead. Scorpius is initially jerkish but has a lot of CC's dorkishness as the story goes on.
