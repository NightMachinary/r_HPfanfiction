I mostly avoided next generation fanfics and stuck with the characters we actually know and the marauders because I felt a lot of next gen fics were pretty poorly executed but I have recently gotten into them and am enjoying them very much. Scorpius is one of my new favourite characters though he doesn't quite beat Hermione or Luna.
