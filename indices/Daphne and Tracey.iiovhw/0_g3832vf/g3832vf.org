The thing that makes Daphne interesting is that she's usually portrayed as a pureblood Sacred 28 Slytherin who, through her relationship with Harry, gives him more options (magical, political, economic, whatever). As a half-blood,^{1} Tracey is less narratively interesting -- there's less of a connection to history and society, less culture shock for Harry, etc.

Could you give Tracey those connections? Sure. But Daphne already has them, so why bother? Just use Daphne.

^{1} According to Rowling's notes, since Tracey never appeared in the stories.
