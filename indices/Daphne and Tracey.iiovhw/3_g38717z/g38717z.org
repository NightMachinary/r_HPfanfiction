Daphne is the sister of Malfoy's wife in the epilogue, according to JKR, not that Malfoy's wife was named in the 7 books. This alone is more interesting and notable than anything Tracey Davis has going for her.

Tracey Davis literally only exists on a list of people in Harry's year that JKR showed on a documentary thing. We also are told she's a halfbood.

Given that one of the complaints the fandom has with Harry vs the pureblood stuff is there is no good reason for the pureblood side. Harry doesn't see, (we the reader are not shown) why they fight. As a result there are people who want to know why the feel the need to do what they do. An extreme but obvious example is the failures of the Weimar Republic (not all their fault by any means) leading to the election of an infamous Austrian man. Without the conditions to force people to make a desperate choice why would they go so extreme?

Daphne's status as a pureblood can provide a gateway into the pureblood 'culture' or whatever it is they're fighting for. Characters are devices and Daphne works better than Tracey as a device for this.
