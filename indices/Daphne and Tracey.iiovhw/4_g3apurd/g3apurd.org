First, I want to point that the friendship between Daphne and Tracey, while "possible", is not written anywhere in the books. In Canon, Daphne is only the name of a girl who pass one of her OWL at the same time than Hermione, While Tracey only appear in the notes of Rowling about "the students in Harry's year" (which makes her technically not canon).

As for "Why is Daphne more popular?", it is probably because she is considered as more interesting by writers and fans. Outside of her House, Daphne brings a lot of things into her relation with Harry : her blood purity, her membership into the "Sacred 28" or even her political knowledge. Most of the "popular" ships also bring something into the story : Hermione has her intellect and her "best friend" statut, Ginny is Ron's sister and a Quidditch player, Luna has her quirkiness, Susan her aunt and "assets". Compared to that, Tracey is . . . a Slytherin, so she seems a bit flat.\\
The only time an author can use Tracey is when he wants Harry to be paired with a Slytherin, but in that case why not use Daphne and use all the tropes that come with her? Even Pansy could be used to create more content "from bitch to lover".

Also, when you looks at the last Harry/ Daphne fics, 90% of them seem to be the same 3 scenarios that are rehashed again and again and again. Years ago, someone wrote a popular story with Daphne inside, which created most of the tropes used with her, and now people write about her because she is popular. If that author had wrote the same story with Tracey as the love interest, we would probably be wondering why she is more popular than Daphne.
