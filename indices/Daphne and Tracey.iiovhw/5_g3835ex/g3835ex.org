We know almost nothing about them in canon. The fanon appearance of Daphne is based on the movies, and the girl assumed to be her is never named or credited as Daphne. We know she has a sister who hooks up with Malfoy, and is a pureblood in Harry's year in Slytherin, and that's about it.

Literally all we know about Davis is that she's a half-blood and in Slytherin.

They're both basically fandom OCs. Their friendship is based on them both being mentioned in the same scenes in the books a couple times.
