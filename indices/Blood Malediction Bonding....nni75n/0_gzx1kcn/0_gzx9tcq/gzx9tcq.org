I could see it happening either way, and there are many ways to explore it, I think.

They either both pass in the hospital, with one mourning the other until the inevitable;

One dies but the other survives and grows up to have a family (Astoria canonically survived until sometime after she married Malfoy and popped out a kid);

They both survive and become close friends throughout their lives, even if Harry doesn't become her brother-in-law or something;

One recovers but the other remains sick;

They both survive into adulthood but both remain horribly ill, and they both try to live their lives as best as possible despite the clouds hanging overhead.

Edit: Also, as it's implied Astoria and Daphne were bigoted early on in their lives (Astoria is said to have changed much like Malfoy did over the course of the series, due to what Voldemort does), his being friends with her could catalyst that change earlier -- might even change Daphne if she's bigoted like her friends/Pansy and company are, too.
