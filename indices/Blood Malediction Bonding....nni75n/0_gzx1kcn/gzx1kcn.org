Wow so many feels. There are so many ways you could take this. I really want to read more of this now ahaha.

One question, do you think this prompt should have a happy ending or not. As in do they survive/get cured or do they both die in the end?

Personally I could see either being good stories depending on which way it goes. Could be a dark, depressing ending or happy with them finding each other and getting better.

I'm more of a happy ending sucker myself ahaha.
