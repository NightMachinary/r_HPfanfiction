That's closer to what I mean. Both of these fics are good enough to avoid straight training/study montages. In each there's a reason for why Harry seeks out additional training/knowledge and in both (but particularly Pretense) there are consequences for him doing so. Neither of them are really "montage and onto the drama;" I was using that more to describe the general sense of the fic, which in all 3 cases is a plot of character progression for the sake of necessity.
