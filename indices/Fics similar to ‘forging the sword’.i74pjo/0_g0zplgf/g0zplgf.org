In terms of handling divergence from canon and the cohesion of the trio, nothing does it better than that fic. Sorry.

If you're looking for magical training montages without bashing (clarification: not direct montages but a general plot of learning more magic), try *Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived* or *The Pureblood Pretense.* Neither feature the trio.
