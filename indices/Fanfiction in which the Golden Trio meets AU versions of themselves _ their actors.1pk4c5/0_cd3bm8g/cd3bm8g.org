There's one called Lily Potter and the Worst Holiday by bobsaqqara. I don't know if it's exactly what you're looking for, but it's really good and only four chapters long. I can't link on mobile but here's the summary "AU Sixteen years to the day after her first born son was murdered, Professor Lily Potter must deal with the arrival of six unknown people. Post OotP. Reedited and reposted"
