Of course, the thing about /Harry Crow/ is that he actually stole the premise from a way better story, the only advantage robst' version has over which being that /Harry Crow/ is completed. It's called linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone) and for all that it's unfinished I highly recommend it.
