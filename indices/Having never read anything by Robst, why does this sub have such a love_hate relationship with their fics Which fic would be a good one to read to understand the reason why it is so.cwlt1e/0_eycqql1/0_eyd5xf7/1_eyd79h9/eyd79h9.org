I'm gonna be upfront and say the first time I read through Harry Crow, I liked it.

The summary made that story sound a lot cooler/different than what we actually got. That's the problem with most of his stuff, too. He's got great ideas, but instead of executing them, he just falls back on bashing and Hermione being Goodness given form. We see Harry use Goblin magic once, and it's to point out to McG that Wizard Transfiguration is ridiculous. Then we see them celebrate Harry being amazing, and then not much else outside of some Goblin dueling.
