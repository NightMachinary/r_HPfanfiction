The thing about robst is that his fics, on paper, sound great. They have great and unique premises, and he writes ungodly amounts of words at ungodly speed. Except all of his stories end up as bland power-fantasies riddled with bashing, no matter what the premise. So readers of taste's history with robst fics is to see a great new fic has popped up on ffnet, to get excited... and then to see the author's name and slam their heads on their desk for having been taken in again.
