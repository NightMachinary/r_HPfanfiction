I think RobSt is a perfect for the new readers. From what I remember from his fics (didn't read one since pretty long), his writing is fine, there is not a lot of mistake, it's pretty easy to read, and he does finish most of his stories (in not all).

But my problem with him is that he is kinda predictable. No matter how a fic start, you know that in the end, it will be a Super Harry that will be better than anyone else and will easily deal with the problems (Voldemort and the retarded Wizard Society in general). Harry will fall in love with Hermione at 11 (every single time) and both will be in a perfect relationship (because god forbid a couple has any form of disagreement), sometimes joined by Luna. Also Dumbledore is a manipulating old coot and the Weasleys are bad.

It's fine when someone just started fanfics, but after monthes, or years, of reading, people learnt the tropes and will only see his fics as cliches nest (though to be fair, some cliche appeared only because he got an idea and made it popular in the first place).

There is also the fact that RobSt seem to love Hermione, and hate Ron. In all his fics, Hermione is perfect and Ron so stupid it's a wonder he can breath. He is one of the reason why I changed my opinion from "neutral toward both of these characters" to "Hermione's hater and hardcore Ron's defender".

So in the end, I think that most of the people who love RobSt fic are either pretty new readers who don't know all the cliches (or are not sick of them yet), or people who just want to read a power fantasy with their goddess Hermione Watson (main reason why she is so loved), and see the traitor Ron being bashed to the ground.
