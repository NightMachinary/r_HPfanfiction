I do actually like most of his fics, but many things said so far are true as well.

I think of Robst Fics as the summer action blockbuster genre of fics. You get a premise which is then played out rather straightforward und predictable. And it usually it is a power fantasy of our heroes.

And this is not necissary a bad thing. For every Schindler's List I do as well enjoy the big Marvel movie with beefy heroes punching stuff.

I think once you dive deeper into the fanfic world you see that Robst fics are shallower than many others, and this leeds to sometimes too harsh criticism.
