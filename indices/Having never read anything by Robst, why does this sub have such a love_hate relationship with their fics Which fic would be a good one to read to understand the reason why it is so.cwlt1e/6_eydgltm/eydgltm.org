It is a feel good, guilty pleasure for me.

Robst is quite imaginative and funny, his stories have no angst and a pretty straight forward approach in dealing with antagonists- they are only there to make the herpes shine. Robst is not interested is discussing Grey characters or redeeming villains. Robst is all about loving the heroes unconditionally and making Fun of The nas guys.

I read Robst to have a good laugh and a good time and that It is all. I really appreciate How he loves and roots for his characters and, more often than not, even when he is bashing someone It is more like for the same of a good joke than out of hatred for said characters.

Harry Crow is the work he obviously put more effort into; fate's gambit and its sequel is among the best Lunar Harmony in which the while sould bound thing feels quite natural and Knowledge is Power is a riot.
