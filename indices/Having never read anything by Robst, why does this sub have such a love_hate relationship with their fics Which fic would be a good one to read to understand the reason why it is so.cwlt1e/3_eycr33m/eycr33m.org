For one, his stories are even more Disney fairytale than PS and CoS, but with far too much romance between an 11-13 yr old Harry and Hermione.

Each story is essentially the same, but with a different premise. They're everything you hate about your typical Harmony story: Ron, Ginny, Dumbledore, canon bashing, deification of Harry and Hermione, muggle wank (I think it's been a long time), and really stupid/easy to defeat villains.
