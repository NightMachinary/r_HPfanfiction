There's a lot of wish fulfillment and fan service at the expense of certain characters. Expect a lot of Weasley bashing, Hermione worshipping, and Harry acting like a cheeky little bugger. (Yes I'm aware he's such in canon but in these fanfics he's usually pretty rude). I think Banking on Her was the only one I've read through, but it's hit or miss. Robst created a lot of the modern fanfic tropes, so he's very influential but not everyone agrees with his interpretation of the series
