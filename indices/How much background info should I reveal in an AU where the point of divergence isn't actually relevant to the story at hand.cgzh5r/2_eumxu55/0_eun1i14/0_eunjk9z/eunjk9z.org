I disagree with the others; going into too much detail might disrupt the flow of the story, especially since you're writing a "family-focused mystery" and Voldemort and his defeat (probably?) won't be relevant at all. A brief mention/description is a good idea to include, but I don't think there should be much beyond a brief description. What's reasonable to tell a 7 year old Harry (if that's how you work it in)? That's probably how much it should be discussed. Saying he was defeated in battle by x person is fine, going into details about who destroyed his horcruxes and when and how is, in my opinion, too much.

If you want to, you could explain it in A/N or post a companion short of Voldemort's defeat.

But ultimately, it's your story. If you've got an idea that you think works, go for it.
