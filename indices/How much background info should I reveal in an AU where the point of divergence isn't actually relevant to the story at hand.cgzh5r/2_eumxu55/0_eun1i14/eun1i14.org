I think perhaps I was unclear in my post. I'm not concerned with *how* to reveal the information, but whether I *should*, and if so then how much. It's not pertinent to the story I'm telling (a family-focused mystery) but I worry that if I don't give /some/ info on V's death, then readers will just end up asking me about it. Or perhaps I'm just overthinking, and as long as V remains irrelevant then readers would be perfectly happy with the story presented?
