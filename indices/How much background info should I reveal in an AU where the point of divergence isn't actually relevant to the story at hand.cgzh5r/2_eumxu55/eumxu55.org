You can have characters mention that in a dialogue. For example, when reading magical history with his mother, Harry asks Lily what actually happened to this Lord Voldemort, so she gives him a lecture right there.

Or Lily is working as an Unspeakable, and she's leading a project that attempts to counter future dark lords with Horcruxes. Her point is that they got lucky since Voldemort only used artifacts for his Horcruxes, so they could be identified and tracked down with relative ease. But how would they deal with a future dark lord who only uses mundane objects for Horcruxes? She can have this conversation with some fellow team members, and you can do a lengthy exposition here.
