Linkffn(Count To Four) is pretty good, featuring Harry as the Master! It's on ao3 as well, and the sequel is up there, but I believe it had a different name for whatever reason.

Also, Linkffn(The Boy Who Waited) is good, if you're okay with slash and Harry/Doctor as the pairing.

I can probably find more, I had a bunch of them bookmarked.
