Brilliant! I hope you can find more, or the story on AO3! The Doctor and any human mortal is a bit.. weird, but I can deal if HP is, say, immortal or .. well, probably as long as he isn't a kid I think.

EDIT: why the HELL would the Doctor fall in love with a twelve years old?! He agonized about girls twice Harry's age because of the age difference! He'd never fall for a twelve year old.

That said, it's... not as squicky as I feared, although I think the Doctor isn't the marrying type, and I might end up liking it after a reread. Whatever the result, I want to thank you for sharing! Pls don't interpret my reactions as a necessary bad thing
