Lucius Malfoy stepped into the Great Hall, taking everyone by surprise, nine more than Draco.

"Mr Malfoy, what's the meaning of this?!"

"Not now Dumbledore, I just wanted to see with my own eyes that you had indeed taken Draco under this so-called school's roof."

"It was within my obligations and authority, Lucius. You have no power here." Said Dumbledore.

"I see. Well, then let me set something clear to all of your students," Lucius said, to the whole pack of students, "Draco is no son of mine. He is a crying little shit. He is a coward, a dimwit and a sorry excuse for an heir. I would rather name my house elf heir over him"

"Tsssss!"

"That must hurt"

"Shut it!" Yelled Draco to the gossiping kids.

"He was, until last month, under my roof, and, until then, he was still wetting his bed," Lucius proclaimed as students laughed, "He is a worthless piece of trash. He can't count beyond 10, for that's the number of fingers on his hands, and the other day, a 5-year-old girl beat the crap out of him. Honestly, good for him that Dobby knew healing charms or that girl making of him her bitch would have been the last memory on him."

Laughs erupted, Draco's pleas to shut them down weren't good enough.

"She was 6, and a half!" Muttered Draco.

Lucius continued, "He can't do more magic than the red sparks, and he does that poorly. As the closest thing to a squib in the family in generations, I have said he brought dishonour to the family. As if that weren't enough, he wasn't even willing to give me an heir... For he is, in his own words, 'as gay as it gets'. I have seen him kissing Gregory Goyle in closets and when he left I found a stack of these!"

Lucius threw a bunch of drawings to the Hall.

"No! Those are mine! Give them back!" Draco shouted, but the Hufflepuffs reached the drawings first.

"But, these are a bunch of drawings of Ron Weasley!" Ernie Macmillan cried, "And he is starkers!"

"What the fuck?!" Ron Weasley shouted in the back.

"Calm down Ron, it looks like Malfoy has a big opinion of you, if you know what I mean"

Lucius snorted "Hope you make a good use of my former son Weasley. I have to say, he is not as hung as he believes you are." And with that Lucius bent his little finger and showed it to the Hall.

"Father!"

"Silence you little-dicked fool! You are no son of mine! You even suck at being a good guy, because I know you take pleasure on kicking Dobby as a sport!"

Hermione gasped loudly

"He started it! The thing mixed my socks and underpants!" Draco hurried as Hermione huffed in the back.

"You would have killed my servant if I hadn't stopped it! As you killed a few previous elves! They cost money you know?" Lucius claimed

"What do you put in your underpants Draco? Your tiny Malfoy?" The twins boomed.

"Enjoy him," said Lucius, "I don't want him as heir for the noble house of Malfoy. Good luck redeeming him See what use you can make of a dimwit, cruel and coward boy with a penis as small as his. Try to pull a Dramione out of that! Lucius out!"

And with that Lucius Malfoy left the room rocking his head as he raised his hands making peace and love signs, a thundering applause joined him all his way to the door.
