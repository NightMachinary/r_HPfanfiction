  Except that you have no evidence it WAS created to start an argument besides 'oh, I don't like this, so it must just be mentioned out of spite instead of offering a potential alternative to typical mpreg'.

Read OP's comments, it's evidence enough.

  I know this might be a huge fucking surprise to you, but sometimes people are actually inclusive of the trans community and that shouldn't be treated as a novelty or an intention to create an argument. :/

Calm yourself. The only issue people took was with the statement "men can get pregnant". Even Transmen who have fully transitioned haven't. OP was looking for a reason to start something about it for some reason, this isn't about being inclusive.
