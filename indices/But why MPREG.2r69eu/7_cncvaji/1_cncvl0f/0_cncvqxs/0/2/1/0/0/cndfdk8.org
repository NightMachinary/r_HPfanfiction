Except that you have no evidence it WAS created to start an argument besides 'oh, I don't like this, so it must just be mentioned out of spite instead of offering a potential alternative to typical mpreg'. You know, since the opening post was about making characters trans to make mpreg more tolerable.

I know this might be a huge fucking surprise to you, but sometimes people are actually inclusive of the trans community and that shouldn't be treated as a novelty or an intention to create an argument. :/
