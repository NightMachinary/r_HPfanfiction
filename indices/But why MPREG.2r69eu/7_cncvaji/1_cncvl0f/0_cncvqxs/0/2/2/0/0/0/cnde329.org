I don't care if you write Harry as a half giant with a flower for genitals. As long as you explain it in context. My entire problem was your statement of "men can get pregnant", when you're obviously /only/ doing so to provoke an argument. Everyone understands that transmen can get pregnant, because they were born with a uterus, whether they wanted it or not. Your statement seems as if men born /without/ one can have children, when that's obviously patently false.

Jesus, I let myself get baited so easily. I knew you were only posting to be contrary, and I fell for it anyway. I'm done, enjoy your evening.
