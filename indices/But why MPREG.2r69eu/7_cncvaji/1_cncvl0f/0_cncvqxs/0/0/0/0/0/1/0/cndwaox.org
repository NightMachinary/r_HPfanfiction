  We aren't talking about medical topics though, we're talking about a magical fanfiction so arguably that is irrelevant.
#+end_quote

Pregnancy is always medical. Unless the fic you're reading has a magical entity growing inside a character that has no biological effects.

  Right this is bullshit for several reasons. One, it's a waste of fucking time
#+end_quote

It spends three seconds. If that three seconds is important to saving the person's life, they have what's called a /stop-and-fix/, which means I won't be asking them questions. I'll be plugging their sucking chest wound or applying a traction splint or performing CPR. On the other hand, I'll pretty much only be asking if they're complaining of abdominal pain, and if I've gotten as far as discussing that, there's no stop-and-fix.

  YOU'LL KNOW WHO YOUR TRANS PATIENTS ARE AND THEREFORE WHICH MEN CAN AND CAN'T GET PREGNANT BECAUSE YOU'RE THEIR FUCKING DOCTOR
#+end_quote

Oh, is that how we're discussing this? Hold on, let me warm up the ol' caps lock.

I'M NOT A DOCTOR. I'M A [[http://www.nols.edu/wmi/courses/wfr.shtml][WFR]]. I WILL BE IN THE WILDERNESS WITH PEOPLE WHOSE MEDICAL HISTORY I KNOW LITTLE ABOUT. I WILL ASK THEM FOR THEIR MEDICAL HISTORY BUT THEY MAY BE RELUCTANT TO DISCLOSE THAT THEY ARE TRANS BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRANS ARE NOT WELL RECEIVED BY THE GENERAL POPULATION. NOT TO MENTION PEOPLE ARE PRETTY TERRIBLE ABOUT SELF-REPORTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS.

Does that clear things up?

    Right now, we're talking about ways in which a man can become pregnant.
  #+end_quote

  No we're talking about why people write/enjoy MPreg stories.
#+end_quote

OP asked: "Do these people not know basic biology?" That leads nicely into whether and how a man can become pregnant biologically.

  bar one immensely rare group of people

Well, I wouldn't call one in a thousand "immensely rare".
