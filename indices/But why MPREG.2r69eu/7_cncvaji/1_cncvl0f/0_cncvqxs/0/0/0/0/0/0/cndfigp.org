I'm actually a woman and not "squicked out" by the idea of a transgender man, pregnant or not. It might be shocking, but I'm also not looking for "sympathizing."

I find it ridiculous that authors writing homosexual pairings often include male pregnancy with only the slightest explanation. They take a cheap route and explain it away as /magic/, but since when can magic do anything? Just like medicine can't cure everything, magic can't do everything. Harry still wears glasses and has a scarcrux, Mr. Weasley is balding, Slughorn is fat, Moody has a fake eye and leg, Eloise Midgen has spots, and so on. Magic clearly can't solve every medical issue, so how can it so simply solve male pregnancy?
