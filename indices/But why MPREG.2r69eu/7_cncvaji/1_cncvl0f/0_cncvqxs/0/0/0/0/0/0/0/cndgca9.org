  I find it ridiculous that authors writing homosexual pairings often include male pregnancy with only the slightest explanation.

Yes, I agree heartily. You can diverge from reality all you want, but most of the possible divergences deserve an explanation. I originally said that I dislike the idea of the power of love being the explanation for male pregnancy.

  They take a cheap route and explain it away as magic, but since when can magic do anything?

Magic in HP can do a huge variety of specific things. It isn't necessary to have magic for losing fat or clearing up acne or restoring hair to have magic for creating a uterus in a man. Granted, creating bodily organs is rather more complicated than magical liposuction.

I've seen people using capitalism to explain the existence of various body modification and self-improvement potions without their widespread use. I have some problems with that, primarily with the magical community being very small and the resulting constraints on supply/demand curves. Especially with ephemeral supplies -- you've got to move that inventory or lose it.

I've also seen people using one-off magical artifacts designed and constructed by ancient geniuses. That's a well-attested thing in canon, what with the Deathly Hollows and the Mirror of Erised and the Philosopher's Stone and Ravenclaw's Diadem and the Sword of Gryffindor.
