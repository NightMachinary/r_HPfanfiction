You're zero for three there.

I'm not being contrary for the sake of it. It's important when discussing medical topics to remember that some men can get pregnant. If I'm treating a man with severe abdominal pain, for instance, I'm not going to instantly rule out ectopic pregnancy immediately; I'm going to ask them if there's any chance that they could be pregnant.

Right now, we're talking about ways in which a man can become pregnant. Discussing trans men is extremely relevant here. OP specifically wanted to eliminate magical solutions to men getting pregnant, which means that being trans is the most straightforward way of achieving that. With such an arbitrary restriction in a series where magic is woven throughout, I am /guessing/ that OP is merely squicked out by the idea of pregnancy in people like him and wanted a bunch of random strangers on the internet to sympathize, but on the off chance he wanted an actual, reasonable mechanism, I provided.

As for trying to be clever, I know exactly how clever I am. I wasn't intending to exercise my cleverness in this thread.
