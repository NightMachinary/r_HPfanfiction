  t's important when discussing medical topics to remember that some men can get pregnant.

We aren't talking about medical topics though, we're talking about a magical fanfiction so arguably that is irrelevant.

  If I'm treating a man with severe abdominal pain, for instance, I'm not going to instantly rule out ectopic pregnancy immediately; I'm going to ask them if there's any chance that they could be pregnant.

Right this is bullshit for several reasons. One, it's a waste of fucking time, there's about 0.1% of the population that are transmen and even lower that would be medically relevant so there is no fucking way you're asking every guy that. Two, and this is really key, YOU ARE FUCKING TREATING THEM, WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU EVEN NEED TO ASK! YOU'LL KNOW WHO YOUR TRANS PATIENTS ARE AND THEREFORE WHICH MEN CAN AND CAN'T GET PREGNANT BECAUSE *YOU'RE THEIR FUCKING DOCTOR* YOU ABSOLUTE IDIOT!! There is no possible reason for you to say that. It's absurd and you're just trying to defend your point and its just ridiculous, you just saw a chance to mention trans people and took it even though it was irrelevant.

  Right now, we're talking about ways in which a man can become pregnant.

No we're talking about why people write/enjoy MPreg stories.

  As for trying to be clever, I know exactly how clever I am. I wasn't intending to exercise my cleverness in this thread.

No you just wanted to talk about trans people. You didn't actually bring anything to the debate but ridiculous arguments saying "men" can get pregnant when we all know they can't bar one immensely rare group of people that were women at birth.
