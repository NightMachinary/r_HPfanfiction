In real life, some men can get pregnant. If you want an explanation that doesn't involve creating a uterus with magic, then make one of the participants trans, with magic to give them an appearance appropriate to their actual gender rather than the gender assigned them at birth.

I wouldn't mind mpreg more than fpreg if there were an explanation for the mechanism. If it's The ♥ Power ♥ of ♥ Love!!! then I'm not at all keen on it. But the biggest problem with it is that it's pregnancy, and you know it's going to be the best experience of their lives.

Seriously, you have a parasite in you that grows to be several percentage points of your bodily mass, rearranging your internal organs. In the meantime, you're horribly unbalanced, leading to spinal problems and heavily reducing mobility. It makes you frequently nauseous. It can lead to osteoporosis. Removing the fetus is one of the most painful experiences that people commonly go through. In my first aid training, someone was pretending to have a broken wrist and I asked how much it hurt, compared to the worst she'd ever experienced. She gave it a three out of ten -- ten out of ten, she said, was when she gave birth.

And people romanticize this! I don't understand it. I strongly doubt any of them have given birth.
