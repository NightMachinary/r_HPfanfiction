I wouldn't mind if it was a genetically female character, who identifies as a man, getting pregnant because the parts are there for it. But a genetically male character getting butt magic pregnant is terrible.

It's too bad fanfiction authors don't do trans MPREG. That'd actually be interesting. Struggling to come to terms with the mismatch between anatomy and their self-perception, acceptance in their family, the school, the world, etc. Lots of room for conflict.
