I always thought the concept of mpreg was ridiculous (although I read some anyway), but then I stumbled across one random fic that completely changed my mind with one point: human transfiguration. Canon characters in HP can go from human body to animal body. Therefore I'll buy that the HP world has a transfiguration process that can give a male human working female parts. I expect it would likely be an expensive, finicky, and rare procedure, and it would be a lot easier/more sensible to just transfigure the man into a woman, but okay, I'll buy it as possible.

Of course, I've never actually seen a mpreg story that uses that logic, mostly it's just "there's a potion"/"oh you didn't know wizards can get pregnant?"

But if you mix logic with working magic then some ridiculous things do start sounding possible...
