In fiction today, Mpreg becomes less absurd with a wide variety of different races, supernatural, and fantasy. I was into DBZ in highschool and the trend was that males Sayians could have children because they're not human (They are an aggressive transforming alien race that looks to be ultra- male dominated.)

Fiction generally (especially today's fiction) allows many not-so-far-off loophoops. If you have sparkly vampires, transforming monsters, and fucking schools for witchcraft and wizardy, two male characters in love wanting to have biological children doesn't seem so crazy.
