One thing I have realized is that MPREG, as a plot device, allows you to pull the 'surprise baby' trope on the slash couple in question - i.e. very easily add drama to the romance.

You can't have a 'surprise baby' if you're adopting or having a surrogate - at least I don't think you can. And depicting the drama of surrogacy or adoption is way harder to do, I think.
