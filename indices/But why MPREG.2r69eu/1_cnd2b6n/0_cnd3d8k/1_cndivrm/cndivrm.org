  A family is a natural progression to a relationship and wanting a child to be biologically related to two important characters and have their specific genes is something everyone can relate to.

Pretty insulting to claim that a child is necessary to form a family, or that the desire for children is something everyone feels. My husband and I are a family, and are perfectly happy without the children we /don't/ want.
