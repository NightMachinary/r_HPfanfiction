I have to disagree that Mpreg is a big part of slash pairings. It's not. Maybe 5 or 10% of stories. Also in a fandom with magic why wouldn't it be possible? People can come back from the dead and change into animals in HP so why not a baby?

Authors write the stories they envision. If they want a story about how a male/male couple builds a family, especially in a fandom with magic, why not Mpreg? I keep being surprised by the criticism "why would anyone write that?" Or the "that author may be young/confused/etc."

The why is "because they wanted to write about that." And people read them because they like them. I can take them or leave them. I'm more concerned that the story is written in standard grammar and has an interested plot.
