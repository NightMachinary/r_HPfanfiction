I mean, I don't see why there being magic DOESN'T mean that anything is possible. These are magical beings who can apparently train the ability to turn into animals at will and despite things like laws of conservation, can transfigure humans into whatever they'd like at will, can apparently be born with the ability to just shapeshift however, etc. I don't see how there's such a big jump from 'Tonks can literally change to look like whatever she wants with no noted canon restrictions' and 'people can just change their heads into shark heads because they needed to breathe underwater' to 'I am a man who wants to have children, there's probably a potion, spell, or transfiguration in existence that will allow me to do so.' I've read a lot of mpreg, if the rest of the plot sounds alright, and I don't see what's wrong with it. If it's not something you like, don't read it. It's like just about every other theme: some are really good, some are trash. I remember reading a creature fic where Harry was a veela or something, and the author had them breed in the bird sense. It was fascinating. I've also read various mpregs with shapeshifting, c-sections, internal vaginas, that alpha/omega stuff, etc etc etc. It's not really any worse than some of the other stuff in the fandoms.
