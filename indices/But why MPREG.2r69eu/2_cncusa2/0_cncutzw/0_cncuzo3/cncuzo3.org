No.

However, a lot of ff writers want to just steamroll their way to desired outcome 'x,' in this case gay dudes having kids.

Option A: Bringing in new characters, developing them (maintaining good relations during the surrogacy period/who gets to be the initial baby daddy/acclimating adopted kids to a new household/what if there is friction there) and a bunch of other shit.

or

Option B: Dude gets pregnant. Hurrah.

While I would prefer reading more about the first one as it is grounded more in reality, as much as anything FF related ever is, the second one is much much faster to write about and therefore easier. All you need to do is ignore basic anatomy and incredibly high likelihood of anal fissures.
