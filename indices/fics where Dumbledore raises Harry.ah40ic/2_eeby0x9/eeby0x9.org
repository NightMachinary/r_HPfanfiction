[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1019740/1/HandMeDown-Clothes][HandMeDown Clothes]] linkffn(1019740) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12208439/1/Harry-s-New-Guardian][Harry's New Guardian]] linkffn(12208439) both meet your request, but honestly don't get your hopes up - the writing's pretty bad.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8653399][the part we choose to act on]] linkao3(8653399) has considerably better writing, but since it involves Dark!Harry I doubt it's what you're looking for.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4308786][no place like home]] linkao3(4308786) has Harry raised at Hogwarts, but Dumbledore isn't really that involved.

I'm sorry to not be of more help, but fics that 1) focus on Harry and Dumbledore and 2) don't have bashing are pretty thin on the ground, sadly.
