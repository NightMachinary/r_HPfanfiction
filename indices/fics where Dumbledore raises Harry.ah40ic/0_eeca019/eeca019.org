I had a different mental image at this prompt:

​

It was a solemn gathering in the Godric's Hollow cemetery. Dumbledore raised his wand and spoke the first phrase. ‘Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son!'

The surface of the grave cracked. A fine trickle of dust rose into the air, and fell softly into the cauldron. The diamond surface of the water broke and hissed; it sent sparks in all directions, and turned a vivid, poisonous-looking blue.

Dumbledore was grim as he levitated the next ingredient: Dobby's left kidney, preserved in ice. Its owner nodded, nervously tugging at his long ears. ‘Flesh of the servant, willingly given, you will revive your master.'

The potion turned a burning red.

‘Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken, you will resurrect your foe.'

Draco -- stunned and anaesthetised as he was -- did not wake up as Dumbledore made a careful incision on the crook of his arm, collecting blood in a vial, before healing the cut. He poured it out into the cauldron. The liquid within turned, instantly, a blinding white.

The cauldron was simmering, sending its diamond sparks in all directions, so blindingly bright that it turned all else to velvety blackness. And then, suddenly, the sparks emanating from the cauldron were extinguished. A surge of white steam billowed thickly from the cauldron instead.

Dumbledore smiled sadly, as Harry rose out of the smoke. It should have never come to this, yet here they were.
