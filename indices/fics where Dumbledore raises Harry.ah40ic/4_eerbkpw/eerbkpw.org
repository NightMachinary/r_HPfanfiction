[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13186280/1/][The Phoenix Burns Brightest]] By: ErmengardeSecret

Dumbledore takes custody of a four-year-old Harry after the Dursleys are investigated by Social Services. He raises him in relative isolation, away from the dangers of the wizarding world, until Harry turns eleven. Then they return to Hogwarts together. Nothing has changed, except for Harry and Dumbledore and what they they mean to each other.
