There's this one fic where Harry drinks a potion that de-ages him about 10 years (post GoF) and Snape ends up raising him (Voldemort was already dead, its a big AU, written before, I think, of OoTP) with Dumbledore retiring to become Harry's "Grandpa", spoiling him rotten as a grandpa usually does in a perfect world. There's obviously more to the story, but that's how it goes.

I don't remember the name, but I may have it archived somewhere in my pc, I could look it for you if you're interested in it.
