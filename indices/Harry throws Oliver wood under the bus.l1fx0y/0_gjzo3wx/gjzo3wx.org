It's referenced several times in Hunter by gredandforgerock, but because he tells his new teammates and word spreads until it becomes something of an in-joke. linkffn(10569323)

But I think the one you're looking for is the one where he tells McGonagall after the game, and she threatens to take away Wood's captaincy if he doesn't adjust his perspective. I'm still looking for that one, but strangely enough "die trying" is a common phrase for a series where he had to kill or be killed by the villain.
