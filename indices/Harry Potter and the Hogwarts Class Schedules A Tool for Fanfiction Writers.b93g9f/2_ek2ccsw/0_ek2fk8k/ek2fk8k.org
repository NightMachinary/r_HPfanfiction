There's some canon justification as well, I believe. Either Dumbledore or McGonagall -I can't remember which exactly- was referred to at one point as Head of the Transfiguration department. Kind of strange to have a department of one person!

It opens the door to there being many more Hogwarts faculty members, although in that case you'd have to come up with a reason why Harry always had the same teachers and fairly consistent classmates. Or just ignore it.

And I guess Defence would only ever have one teacher at a time- though even there, it's possible that there used to be multiple Defence professors at once, but the curse winnowed them down, until getting even one replacement was almost impossible.
