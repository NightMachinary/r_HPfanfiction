Maybe for the children to have consistency in how the material is taught. A big issue in school is that you get one professor one year that likes papers in xy format, the next year a different professor likes yz format, one teacher says you'll learn about x next year and the other says you already learnt x last year. So maybe student groups are assigned to a professor that teaches them for their entire school career. (Or, more realistically, just one more thing not really thought through 🤷🏻‍♀️)
