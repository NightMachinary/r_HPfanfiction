My headcanon has always been core classes MWF with electives and flying and the like on TuTh. That only works where like in my story DA, there are more than one professor per subject(three in fact).

Also, in my headcanon each DADA prof follows the last viable lesson plan written by Merrythought that is updated by Dumbledore when he can with only blowhards like Lockhart and Umbridge going their own way.
