In our University a class is 50 mins where the remaining 10 will be to go to places (building s are far apart so it's doable) Electives are usually around 1hour and 20 min.

If topic is not finished by the time the period ends. Prof assigns essay to make sure student reads up on the topic so they can continue following the syllabus. So essays are unlikely as it seems. it also probable that non essay assignments are answered in class the next meeting checked by seatmate or something then proof get it all afterwards and records it.

I believe there is truly a course syllabus where a topic is followed at specific dates and highly scheduled but the style and method is left to the teacher. Or DADA would have failed a long time ago. From what I can infer,

1st is introductory definitions and basics, like difference of charm, hex, jinx 2nd is for 1-2 X beings as well as common creatures, also Lockhart's dueling club is a club not part of the actual class (possibly pre requisite for care of magical creatures) 3rd is for the really dangerous but uncommon ones 3-4X beasts 4th is curses, hexes and jinxes, definitions and theories 5th is combat/dueling spell defensive spells, definition and theories (Umbridge removed the practicals and a watered down version.) 6th and 7th is probably to build up prerequisites of other jobs, (I think at the very least it has spell/curse identification, countercurse, basic healing, five X and above beasts and creatures, and the likes since it is needed for curse breaker, healing, aurors and stuff)

I think of double period class as something like a laboratory class like potions has a double period and has a single period. One for practicals (laboratory) and one for lecture.

As an example transfiguration lecture is about gamp's law, while lab/ double period will be when students will try in inanimate to animate or something.

Charm's lecture will be charm interaction on things that don't have necessary parts, double charm's will be a tap dancing pineapple (since pineapple doesn't have feet, one will test how it will behave and make it dance despite having no legs) the purpose is so that one can guess what will happen if one applies charm to make something do something that it theoretically cannot do.

(I seriously don't understand why people assume in fics that there's no lecturing done on potions and just straight up follow the formula. The way I see it. Snape probably give lab topic before hand and if you don't do advance reading you're Fkd at pre Lab quizzes. That's how chem is taught to me, like you can fail lab class but pass lecture. I kind imagine Snape reading lab reports and commenting that everyone is so fking stupid since the topic is covered in lecture class. Like my old prof.)

HBP's book is like a lab manual where Snape wrote important lecture/reference note on it's not "I'm going to teach you potions better." But rather, "here's relevant points for this topic I got from from reference book kind of notes". Or "here's a short cut" but a book filled with nothing but short cuts will not teach theory.
