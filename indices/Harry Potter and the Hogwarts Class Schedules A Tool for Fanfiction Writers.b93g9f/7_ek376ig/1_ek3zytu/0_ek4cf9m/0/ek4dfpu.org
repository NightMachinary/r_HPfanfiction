I'm from Czech Republic, I attend public school with specialization - which is very normal, the amount of subject wary but it will be probably always over 10 subjects. We also have Gymnasium which has just general subjects like chemistry, literature, czech, English + other language, math...

We also have schools with specialization in common worker fields - furniture making, car repairing, dressmaking, hairdressing or cooking and basically anything else you need for future jobs :D

I studied management in transport (so Economy, entrepreneurship, accounting, aerodynamics, history of flying, subject about air traffic in general and all the laws, how airports work and shits like that :D)
