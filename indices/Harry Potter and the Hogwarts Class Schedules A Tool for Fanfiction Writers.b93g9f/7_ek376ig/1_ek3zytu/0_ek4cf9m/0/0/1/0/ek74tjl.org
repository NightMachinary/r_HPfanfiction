Yeah we do, it's mad stupid. Like, I get the idea is to give us a more well-rounded education (and I'm sure it does make a difference) but like...isn't there a more efficient way to do it? Everyone takes the same GEs (that's what we call those requirements) regardless of what they're studying---so a humanities major (who is generally better at writing) has to take the same amount of writing classes as a STEM major (who may be generally not as good at writing). It's quite ridiculous imo
