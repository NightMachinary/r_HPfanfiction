Yes, at 15 we/ sometimes our parents pick high school with specific field we want to study :D I think for some jobs it is very good system and you finish high school with maturita exam (you have to write final work, have oral and written exam from all four years of education) or you have final and practical exam at the end but you get some sort of qualification list (hairdressers, plumbers and any similar works :D )
