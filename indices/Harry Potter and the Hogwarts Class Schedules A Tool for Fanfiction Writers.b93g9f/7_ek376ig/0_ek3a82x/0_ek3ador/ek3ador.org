How many classes did you take? And for how long did you meet for each class? The key here is they're taking 8 classes simultaneously at 13 (middle school age) while only meeting two hours a week.

Also, I understand with homework there may not be a need to go over a lot of material. But from what we've seen in the books (from what I recall) most of the homework was only essays and practicing the spells they're learning. No mention of required reading (except perhaps to supplement the essays) and the essay topics were usually on things discussed in the class already rather than asking the students to go over things on their own. Of course a lot of this random academic stuff isn't rly shown much in the books so it's mostly speculation.
