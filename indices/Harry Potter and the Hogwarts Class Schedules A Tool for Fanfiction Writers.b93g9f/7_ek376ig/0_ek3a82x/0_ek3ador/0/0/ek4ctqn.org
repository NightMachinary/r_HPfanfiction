Interesting! Do you mind if I ask, where are you from? Was this kind of schedule typical for public schools in your area?

I realized that since Hogwarts is in Britain and I'm, well, not, I really can't apply my experiences to this. Also, I guess you could count Hogwarts as a private/specialized/boarding school, which could operate vastly differently from a typical public school in Scotland or England.
