No, my school was unusual in this case. It was originally intended to be a homeschool supplement, with classes that are hard to homeschool (math, science, etc) taught by professional teachers. By the time I moved into the area, it had grown to offer enough classes that you could get your high school degree just taking classes from there. You paid like $300 per class per year, directly to the teacher, and had an additional one-time $300 payment to the school itself for administrative purposes. Since for most of my time there it didn't have any sports teams, I was allowed to be on my local public school's football team.\\
I am from the USA by the way, though I do have close friends from Britain that I have leaned on for my understanding of the British school system.
