First of all this tool is amazing. Like damn, programmers are on some crazy shit.

At my university, all our passing periods are 10 minutes regardless of how far your next class is. Sometimes I have to book it and cross the entire campus (~1.3 miles) in 10 minutes. A lot of the time is spent in “traffic” bc there's so many people at my school. So 15 minutes is way more than enough for a school of Hogwart's size with such little people. I'd say even 10 minutes are efficient.

One note, it's kind of crazy (to me) to have them taking 8 classes by 3rd year. My middle school had a max of 6 classes and my high school had a max of 7 (where u were considered a little crazy is you took all 7; 5-6 classes was a little more usual). This was while meeting 5 times a week for about 50 minutes each period. When you compare like this it seems impossible that the students would ever finish learning anything before they end up taking their final exams, especially if (as according to the book as you researched it) they're only meeting for 2 hours a week. I cant imagine how that would work.
