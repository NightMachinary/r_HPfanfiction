This is amazing!

One thing to add perhaps: I went to boarding school (though in the US) and we had week 1, week 2 schedules. This allowed some classes to meet more in one week than another, and to distribute longer blocks equally. Also we had designated time slots for longer blocks and only certain classes used the whole block. It would be

A* 8-8:50

B 8:55-9:45

Break

C 10:45-11:35

D 11:40-12:50 (Always long time slot, sometimes classes would go BACD, CDAB, DCBA)

Break

E 1:20-2:10

F 2:15-3:25 (example long block, could be E, G, H time slot)

Break

G 4:15-5:05

H* 5:10-6:00 (EFGH always stayed in order)

Star means some classes don't meet that day, depending if the class used the auxiliary block. Auxiliary block was always first in the morning, and there were always 2/day, one in second half of day. Also Wednesday was half day for sports. Every student had a free block (like never had a class during E block) and one set of two were for sports. Team sports were usually GH or EF.
