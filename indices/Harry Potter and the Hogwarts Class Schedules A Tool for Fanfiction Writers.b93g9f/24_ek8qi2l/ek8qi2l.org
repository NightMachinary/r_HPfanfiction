tbh, there's probably so few people taking Runes and Arithmancy (Muggle Studies too, that's basically a 3-house course) that all of the houses could take them together...also, how likely is it that anyone actually takes NEWT History at a school that employs the Spectral Soporific?

Also, there might be something jacked up with the core class COUNTIF setting, it was counting the electives instead when I first tried it. (easily fixable, just minorly annoying)
