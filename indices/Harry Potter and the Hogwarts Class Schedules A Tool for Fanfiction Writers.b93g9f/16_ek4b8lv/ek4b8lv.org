Order of the Phoenix chapter 12 'Professor Umbridge' has a lot of info about the Monday timetables.

Class periods appear to go 45 minutes, based in the 3/4 of an hour of Binns' droning Harry suffered through. Double potions gave Snape enough time to warn them about OWLs, start off on describing a potion and then set them an hour and a half to make it, while still leaving clean-up time at the end. Snape charged them with homework that he expected to get back that Thursday, which seems to indicate that major subjects occupy at least 3 periods during a week.

With those guidelines, I think the timetable needs at least seven slots per day, possibly eight. I worked up a model where there are two periods early morning, a half-hour break, two late morning periods, lunch, then three afternoon periods leading into an early dinnertime. I can't remember all the references that went into that, but it makes a certain sense to me.

More info: the next chapter had the trio in double Charms and then double Transfiguration before the lunch hour on Tuesday. After lunch they had Care of Magical Creatures, followed by Herbology, where they bumped into Ginny and Luna leaving the greenhouse. After class he had to head straight to the Great Hall to grab something to eat before his 5 PM detention with Umbridge.
