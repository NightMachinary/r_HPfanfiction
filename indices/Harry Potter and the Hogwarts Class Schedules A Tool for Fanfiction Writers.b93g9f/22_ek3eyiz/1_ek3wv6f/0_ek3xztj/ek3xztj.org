Depends on the local accent for pronunciation, but any place you have a list of classes and times, like at a gym, school etc, it would be a timetable.

I'm now trying to think when I would use "schedule". Ahead of schedule?

I love looking at the differences in word use and language and find it really interesting to discuss.
