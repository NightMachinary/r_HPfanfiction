I considered something like that, actually. It would be similar to how my high school worked, where each class met once a week.

In fact, that would make it easier on both the students and the teachers. However, I was trying to make it as canon-compliant as possible (within reason), and in canon we know that not every class period is a 'double period.' There's not really an easier way to incorporate some classes that are double periods and some classes that are not without either weekly rotating schedules (not ideal), having the students be in class late in the day (4:30 is already pretty late for classes to end), and/or giving core classes larger time blocks than electives (not ideal).

Then again, if someone comes up with a better way that is consistent with canon but is also less unwieldy, I welcome their input and may even create a schedule generator for their idea.

Heck, I might just create a schedule generator for your idea just for fun. Once-a-week classes, each of them say, two hours in length. My high school had once-a-week 1.5 hour classes and it worked out okay.
