The foundation of Hogwarts and the exile of Slytherin preceded witch hunts by a few centuries though, with several secular and even Papal bans around the time Hogwarts was founded.

As for how Slytherin could have hated them? Well, he was a bigot. I mean, Hitler had a thing about Jews betraying Germany when they proportionately fought the hardest in WWI from all population groups within the German Empire. Bigots don't do normal logic.
