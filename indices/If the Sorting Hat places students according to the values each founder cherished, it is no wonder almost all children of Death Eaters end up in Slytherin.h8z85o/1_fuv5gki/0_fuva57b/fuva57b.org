THANK YOU. This has always been my head canon. I've never understood how Salazar could have possibly hated muggleborns. This is a thousand years ago. The population is tiny and there's no magic schools at this point. The only way your learning magic is self taught or taught by parents. You're also not going no know any wizards/witch's unless you become powerful enough to become a court mage. Your not gonna marry a wizard/witch 90% of the time your gonna marry local muggle boy/girl.
