To be honest, considering the time in which the Founders lived, and all that happened in history (Witches hunt and trials) I don't think Salazar dislike of Muggles was a bad thing at the time.

I honestly think that his dislike for muggles was for good reason, but that as time went on, that reason was lost, and just the fact that he didn't like them remained.

With that reasoning, the basilik wouldn't be to clean the castle of muggleborns, but to protect it and it's students from attackers, and the basilik would have instructions to listen to Salazar's heirs when it came to protecting the school.
