Yeah, they happened around (and were the reason for if I'm not mistaken) the edification of the Statute of Secrecy. But what I really meant was that, at the time, there would have been I think a lot more legitimate reasons to dislike and feel superior to Muggles (lack of hygiene, education, rise of Christianity and wars they might have to get involved with because there was no separation back then).

And for witches hunt to be banned, they had to be a thing first, so just because they were banned, doesn't mean it wasn't a threat. After all, bigots and zealous hardly care about laws if they think they are in the right.
