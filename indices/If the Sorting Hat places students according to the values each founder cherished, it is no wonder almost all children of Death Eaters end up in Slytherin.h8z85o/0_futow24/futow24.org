According to Dumbledore Slytherin also valued things like resourcefulness, determination, a certain disregard for rules in his Students, thats not necessarily bad and Hermione, Ron and Harry would easily also fit inside that. Like I am not gonna deny that a blood purist/dark wizard will most likely end up in Slytherin, but you can easily assume lots of normal students end up there as well.
