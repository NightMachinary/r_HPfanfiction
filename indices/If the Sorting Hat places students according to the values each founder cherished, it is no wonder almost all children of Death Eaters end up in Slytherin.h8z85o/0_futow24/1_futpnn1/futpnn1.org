Harry was pretty close, but I don't see the others fit Slytherin particularly well. Ron is good at chess, but that hardly makes him a tactician or great leader like fanon tries to. I am pretty good at strategy games, but I am sure as hell not qualified for battlefield command. And most modern strategy games are a lot more realistic than chess. And Hermione is honestly a Hufflepuff with her deep loyalty to Harry or a Ravenclaw for her learning abilities before she is a Slytherin. Most of her more devious actions are done for Harry.

  resourcefulness, determination

But with most children, those traits usually related to their friends (Hufflepuff or Gryffindor) or academics (Ravenclaw). You will find ambitious, determined children, but those will be one in a thousand, if not rarer.

  a certain disregard for rules

That describes all children. You might as well say "breathing air".
