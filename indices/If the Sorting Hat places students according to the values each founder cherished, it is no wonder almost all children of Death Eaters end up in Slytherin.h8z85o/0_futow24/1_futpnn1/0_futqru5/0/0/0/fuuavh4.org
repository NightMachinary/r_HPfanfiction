  But that was all done out of loyalty to Harry, by both of them as well as a sense of duty, not out of any personal desire.

Slytherin appreciates a "certain disregard for the rules".

Just because Hermione is motivated by loyalty to Harry doesnt mean she doesn't disregard the rules.

Disregard for rules doesn't mean breaking them for the hell of it whether it achieves something you want or not. It means deciding that X is more important to you than a particular rule, so ignoring that rule fo achieve X.

I buy the idea that Hermione (who is cunning resourceful and determined) could, in a more neutral world, have been right at home in Slytherin.

Ron less so, I think, as though he has /dreams/ of being great (as seen in the mirror of Erised), he doesn't actually have the determination to achieve any of those dreams.

Having said that, perhaps if he had found his way into Slytherin it would have cultivated in him a greater drive to realise those dreams?
