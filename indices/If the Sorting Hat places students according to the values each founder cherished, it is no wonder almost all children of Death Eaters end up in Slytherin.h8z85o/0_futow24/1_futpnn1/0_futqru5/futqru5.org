What does Ron not being a great leader have to do with anything, he sure as hell is very ambitious as a 11 year old, like the mirror of erised showed.

And Hermione honestly fits all houses, like you can pretty much find all the traits we find mentioned in the songs in her, except pure blood of course.

As to the disregard for rules, I am pretty sure scales matters here, like in that year alone Hermione stole a dark book from the restricted section brewed polyjuice potion and Harry and Ron impersonated their classmates to find out who the heir of Slytherin is.

For most kids disregard for rules is more about stuff that restricts their ability to have fun or when it takes too much effort to follow the rules.
