I have a pet conspiracy theory that JKR had originally planned to put Harry (the hero) in Gryffindor, Ron (the friend) into Hufflepuff, Hermione (the brain) into Ravenclaw, and Draco (the adversary) into Slytherin. However, she then realised how much of a logistical nightmare it would be for the three to interact, so she stashed them all into Gryffindor.

Harry would make a better Hufflepuff than a Slytherin, I think. One could make a case either way based on the Mirror of Erised, since Slytherins appear to value familial loyalty, but the aspiration to be reunited with one's family with no connotations of wealth or power strikes me as more Hufflepuff than Slytherin.

Ron probably has a better case for Slytherin, since he actually has something to prove, even if he lacks the discipline to do so. A somewhat uncharitable but understandable interpretation of his character is that befriending the BWL satiated his ambition to be distinguished from his brothers at least somewhat. (Did I just make the case that /Harry/ held /Ron/ back from greatness? I think I did. O_O )

For Hermione, I don't think it's loyalty to Harry in particular as much as loyalty to the causes that Harry happens to play a key role in due to prophecy and other circumstances. When the two conflict, she generally chooses the cause over Harry, which makes her a Gryffindor through and through. She'd make a terrible Hufflepuff, because for all her good intentions, she isn't nice, she only barely tolerates others' flaws, and she certainly [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Rogers][doesn't love people just the way they are]]. I used to be a fan of Slytherin!Hermione, but I don't think she's selfish enough for that.
