From the fics you listed, you are interested in fics with fem protags and a bit of magic?

A few fics you might like:

1. Tales of Three linkffn(12953614) : A Fem!Harry that will probably become what Indy!Harry's think they are. Recently updated.

2. Potter Vs Paradox linkffn(11488906) : Fem!Harry time travels into the past but accidently goes to an alternate dimension. Dead.

3. Six Pomegranate Seeds linkffn(12132374) which is Hermione Time Travel. Finished.

There is also /Victoria Potter/, /The Pureblood Pretense/ and /What's her name in Hufflepuff/, all top quality, but those get recced here all the time anyways.
