I recently read a fic (I believe it's linkao3(9821300)), where Ollivander makes wands in a magical trance state. Wand-making is not a big focus and this is only mentioned in passing in the fic (at least as far as I know, I only got up to Chapter 29 before I gave up the fic), but the idea is certainly an interesting one.
