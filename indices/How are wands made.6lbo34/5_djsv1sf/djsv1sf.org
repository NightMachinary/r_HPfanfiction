I'm not sure why Hermione needs a custom wand - maybe Ollivander's shop has been destroyed or he doesn't have access to it, but I was reading the wikia today and it said Garrick Ollivander (the current wand maker) was the first to stop making custom wands. He decided to use only quality wand ingredients, instead of using whatever was brought in by the client, and let the wand choose the wizard. It seems he was the first to think of wands as semi-sentient, rather than a mundane tool.

All it has to say about his methods is that they a)revolutionized wand making and b) were tightly guarded. So I'd suggest that he uses a variety of charms and spells to find the best trees to harvest from, and the best branches, and probably harvests them at a particular time, day, and season. After all, some potions ingredients are also harvested at particular times and in special circumstances.

As for cores, he chose the three he works with after long study and experimentation. I imagine using anything else would be painful for him, like an artist using sub-par paints.

I'd like it if he used hand tools rather than his wand to carve.
