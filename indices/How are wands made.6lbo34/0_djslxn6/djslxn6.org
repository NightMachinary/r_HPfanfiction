Very carefully, and not as easily as every single fic that shows "custom wands" portrays. I imagine part of it is alchemical, merging the parts into one whole. There is that fic where Harry is sent to Azkaban wrongfully, and when he escapes (I believe), he basically ends up apprenticed to Ollivander. I want to say it is linkffn(Griffin Reborn by Ytria). There's other stuff in it that I think is bonkers magic wise, but at least the wand creation is viewed as easy.
