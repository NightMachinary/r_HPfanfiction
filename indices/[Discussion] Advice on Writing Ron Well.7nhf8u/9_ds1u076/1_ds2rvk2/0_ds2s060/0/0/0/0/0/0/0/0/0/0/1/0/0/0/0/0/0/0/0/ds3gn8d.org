No, there are NO hints that he was doing it. Your entire argument is based on saying "what if" and jumping to conclusions.

Besides, NOW you've totally changed your tone. Just before you were saying how Ron could be summed up by "Is it food? Eat it. Is it Harry's? Be jealous, rant about unfair life. Does it need hardwork? Drop it, and eat more. Your friends need a faithful friend? Be angry and leave. Cone back when things are easy."

You've constantly been on about how worthless and jealous and obviously a bad person he is, and you've even called him stupid. NOW you want to try to angle it that he's this devious mastermind who manipulates Harry?
