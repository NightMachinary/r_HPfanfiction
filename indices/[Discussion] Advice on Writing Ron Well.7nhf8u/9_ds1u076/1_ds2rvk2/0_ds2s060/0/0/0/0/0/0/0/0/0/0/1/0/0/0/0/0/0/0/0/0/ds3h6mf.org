  You've constantly been on about how worthless and jealous and obviously a bad person he is, and NOW you want to try to angle it that he's this devious mastermind who manipulates Harry?

Do you see it now? He was a worthless friend, since he never was a friend. He was jealous. He spent his time eating. He was jealous of Harry's success. As soon as keeping close to Harry became tougher than whatever goal he had planned, he dropped Harry, and ate more food. He left Harry more than once.

Now that we understand he wasn't a brain dead idiot, and was a master chess player, a game that needs not only careful planning but overall keen eye on whole board, we can say that Ron was smart enough to make strategies for his own goals in life.

Harry was a naive, idiot boy, from an abused home. Ron was a cunning, chess player, with knack for strategy. Ron isolates Harry, keep him close for benefits, uses him, leaves when it isn't worth it, come back, leaves again when it gets tough, comes back again.

He was a glory hound. JKR revealed in book 1, in front of mirror.
