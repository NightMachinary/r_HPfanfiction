Well, at least now you agree that Ron won't tell Harry if he was using Harry. (Why did it take so long).

There are several things that hint that Ron was doing it.

But before that we should establish another thing. Was Ron stupid or Smart?

I believe he was smart. He was good at chess. He even beat a hurdle set by teacher when he was 11 year old. Unless you are one of those who believe Dumbledore set it easy so that Harry's confrontation with Voldemort could be arranged, you should agree that Ron did awesome.

I think Ron understood complex situations. He was master at chess. He knew importance of powerful, well placed pieces, strategies and could plot and execute complex action plans to achieve his goals.
