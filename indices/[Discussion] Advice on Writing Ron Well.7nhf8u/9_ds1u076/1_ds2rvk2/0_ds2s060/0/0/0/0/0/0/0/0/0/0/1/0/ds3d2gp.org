Canon, book or movie, is 3rd person limited PoV. We get to see things Harry saw. We get to hear things Harry heard. And I'm sure Ron is not going to come out and say:

"Mate, I've been taking advantage of you".

We can see thing that Harry could see. Even if he was bad at understanding them doesn't mean we can't.

Ron doesn't seem like a friend I would keep. May be an 11 year old naive kid can have him, for the rest of his school. I don't think I can.

Not if that kid is angry, jealous and betrayer.
