/I'm seeing a pattern here. He is always there when it suits him./

He goes out of his way to be there for Harry, to a much bigger degree than Harry is there for him. This is typical of Harry, by the way -- both Ron and Hermione are MUCH more supportive of Harry than Harry is of them. Partly this is for plot-reasons, because Harry plain NEEDS more support... but saying that Ron is "always there when it suits him" is something that actually fits Harry better as a character.

But even if it WAS true... for someone who used that Ron "wouldn't be useful to me" as an argument for why harry shouldn't be friends with him, that's a pretty hypocritical argument. You seem far more interested in what YOU can get out of a friendship, not what's in it for your friend. That's a trait I cannot assess to Ron.

/Harry had money, fame, power. You make it sound like Ron wasn't there for anything./

Harry was hated, shunned, feared and ridiculed several times. You make it sound like Ron was just trying to edge up to the famous kid.

/Harry's circle of friends stunted after him. Most famous person and his only friend in that world is a bigoted Weasely who on his first meeting tells you that Slythwira are bad./

Except he doesn't. It's HAGRID who on first meeting tells you Slytherins are bad, not Ron. The movie changed it to Ron, but the movie butchered Ron's character anyway.

I've gone through the books specifically looking for parts where Ron mentions Slytherin, and he BARELY mentions it at all. When he mentions Slytherin, it's mostly in the context of how they did in the Quidditch games. Not counting speaking about Malffoy or Snape (whom he don't like as PEOPLE), he says something negative about Slytherin like THREE times in the entire series.

First, he says "what if I'm in Slytherin?" but doesn't elaborate, because the discussion turns to Harry not knowing anything about the wizarding world and Ron trying to cheer him up.

Then, in the second book, he's astonished that Salazar Slytherin was the one who started the entire "pureblood" thing, calls him a "twisted old loony" and says he's glad he's not in his house.

And I think it's in the fifth or sixth book he says that he doesn't want to stand together with Slytherins.

Contrast this to Harry, who can't mention Slytherin without mentioning how much he dislikes them. Ron is NOT an anti-Slytherin bigot, no more than Harry is LONG before he discusses it with Ron.

If you're going to blame anyone for turning Harry against Slytherin, blame Malfoy and Hagrid. Malfoy was the unpleasant guy who said "I'll be in Slytherin," which gave Harry a negative opinion of Slytherin before he knew what it even was, Hagrid was the one who said that all Dark wizards came from Slytherin. Ron had nothing to do with it.

/The one who bullied a girl to tears./

You mean, the one who called Hermione a "nightmare" behind her back, didn't intend for her to hear it, and felt really guilty after he realised she had? That's not mentioning the fact that Hermione had been nagging, insulting and belittling him every single chance she got up until then, and he barely said a word to her in his own defence before he decided to vent to Harry how much she annoyed him. Yeah, what a TERRIBLE AND HORRIBLE bully.

/Who know who else he drove away to keep the most famous and notably rich kid as his friend./

You've been reading too much fanfiction. There is NO part of canon that even suggests that Ron EVER did anything of the sort.
