You literally are describing a person that's completely different from the Ron in canon. And you're really demonstrating why Harry is a much better protagonist for these books than you would have been.

Not the first fight they had? Well then, what WAS the first fight they had? I can't think of any! Seriously, Harry and Ron NEVER fight. Ron and Hermione, yes, but Harry and Ron are almost always on the same page. They come to blows TWICE over the course of seven books; both fights are BIG and both fights involve both of them acting like jerkish teenage boys... but they both get over themselves and make up. Which is a hell of a lot more mature than a "drop 'em the moment they do things I don't like."

Always seething, angry and jealous? Since when? He's got a temper and a fair amount of insecurity and self-loathing, but have you seen his normal reaction to Harry experiencing cool stuff? He's more thrilled than Harry is! He's like "it's so awesome that you got an invisibilty cloak!" "You didn't face charges for blowing up your aunt because you're famous, that's SO COOL!"

And if it was just the "Boy Who Lived" he wanted to be friends with, he would not have stuck by Harry like he did.

While Ron was not particularly well-utilised in the books, and even less so in the movies, writing him off in this way is doing a serious disservice to him as a character. And, again -- it's just describing fanon-Ron, not the canon one.
