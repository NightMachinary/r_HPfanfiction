Oh. Right. He's good at chess, and he doesn't want to be overshadowed. CLEARLY that proves that he's a devious mastermind who uses and abuses people and isn't really a friend. Do you even hear how ridiculous you sound?

Besides, two flaws in your argument:

ONE: He wanted to be noticed by others. Being Harry's friend made him LESS noticed because everyone was already looking at HARRY. Even Ron himself knew this. The "strategy" is a bad one.

TWO: If he's such a manipulative genius, why on earth would he ever do anything that would make him seem like anything less than the perfect friend? You are the one insisting that he whines, complains and betrays Harry all the time. That's not a sign of a good manipulator.

Face it. You don't have a SINGLE good argument. And you're contradicting yourself again.
