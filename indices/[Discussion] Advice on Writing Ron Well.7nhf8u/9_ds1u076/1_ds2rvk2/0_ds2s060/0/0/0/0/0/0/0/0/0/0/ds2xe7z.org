I'm seeing a pattern here. He is always there when it suits him.

Harry had money, fame, power. You make it sound like Ron wasn't there for anything.

Harry's circle of friends stunted after him. Most famous person and his only friend in that world is a bigoted Weasely who on his first meeting tells you that Slythwira are bad. The one who bullied a girl to tears. Who know who else he drove away to keep the most famous and notably rich kid as his friend.
