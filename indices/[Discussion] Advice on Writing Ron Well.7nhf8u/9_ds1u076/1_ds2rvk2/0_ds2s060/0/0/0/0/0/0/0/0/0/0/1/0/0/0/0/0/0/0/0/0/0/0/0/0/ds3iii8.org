Why Indeed. Who would remember the ONLY friend Harry had. I mean it's very fortunate that Harry ran to save Hermione and then she tagged along them.

Yes, bad strategy. didn't we agree that he was jealous and angry. Jealous that Harry had more shine and angry that his strategy failed. His temper sometimes got the better of him and made him do rash things.
