Oh it has. JKR made it very clear more than once in book 1 that Ron was very good at chess. Then she revealed his hearts desires in front of mirrors.

Ron saw himself as the Gryffindor Quidditch Captain and Head Boy, holding up the Quidditch Cup, as he has always been overshadowed by his brothers and is always striving to be noticed by others.

What best way to go about it than become the only and best mate of most famous wizard of their age?

How very convenient that a master chess player couldn't find a compartment with empty seat for himself in whole train. Poor unfortunate master chess players.
