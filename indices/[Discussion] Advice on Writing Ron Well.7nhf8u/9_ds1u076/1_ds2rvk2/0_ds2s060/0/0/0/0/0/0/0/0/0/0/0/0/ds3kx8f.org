One can't be a student of political science and public relations without ability to do so.

Let's try:

That half-blood forced all the pureblood bigots on their knees, made them suffer under cruciatus and usurped their power and money. A lonely, orphaned boy, forced to stand agaisnt bullies stumbled into a magical world,, only to be pushed into wolves den because of slithery heritage.

Ridiculed and abused Tom Riddle became a model student, learned stuff and controlled every bigot who ever bullied him in school for being a half blood.

He even went to Dumbledore, begged him to let him stay at school, but was sent away by him to abusive people. They very people who taught him rule of 'survival of fittest'. Tom had to be stronger and meaner than bullies to avoid getting bullied.

If only Dumbledore, the very Dumbledore who fed and raised Harry as pig to be slaughtered at appropriate time, had helped Tom, we might not even have a Voldemort to worry about.
