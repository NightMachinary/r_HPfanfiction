So, one fight, and you're ready to forget three years of friendship? A friend who's literally risked his own life for you, TWICE, backed you up when everyone else was against you, broke you out of your abusive foster-parents' home, basically adopted you into his family, and invited you to a huge sporting event... and the moment you have your first fight, you drop him like a cack of guano and decide to KILL him? Yeah, you sound like an AMAZING friend.
