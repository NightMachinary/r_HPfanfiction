It makes sense though. Naive and stupid Harry was so mentally deranged that he had attachment issues with a person that he barely knew for 1 month and threw an unforgivable at enemy.

If that's the kind of psychologically damaged person he was at 16 imagine the damage at 11. Of course he was attached to his first friend.
