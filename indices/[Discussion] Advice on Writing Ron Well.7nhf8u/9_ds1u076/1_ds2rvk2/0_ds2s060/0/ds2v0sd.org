You're describing fanon-Ron, not the canon one.

/"He ate like an animal."/

Apart from a few instances of talking with his mouth full, and one instance of Hermione chiding him for "always eating" in the movies, this never happens in canon. This is a classic example of how fandom takes a VERY minor trait of a character and blows it out of proportion until the trait doesn't resemble what's in canon at all.

/"He abandoned his friends when things got tough in 7th book,"/

Does everyone keep forgetting that Harry explicitly TOLD HIM to leave? Ron was wearing the Horcrux, which was exaggerating his already-prominent temper. It goes like this, more or less:

RON: This camping trip sucks, we're not getting anywhere!\\
HARRY: Boo-hoo, cry me a river. Nobody said it would be easy!\\
RON: I'm worried about my family!\\
HARRY: Hah! MY family is DEAD!\\
RON: You're being a total jerk!\\
HARRY: Well then, leave! Get out of here!\\
RON: Fine!

And so he storms off. Only to regret it and try to return immediately after, but then he's attacked by Snatchers, then he Splinches himself, then he gets lost in the forest and can't find the campsite again. Not a great moment for Ron, but this "abandoned his friends when things got tough" is a blatant misrepresentation of the character.

/"he was complaining about lack of food in that adventure."/

Ever gone hungry? I mean, REALLY hungry, and you don't know where your next meal is coming from? All three characters were snappish and surly over the lack of food. Ron was the loudest, true, but this is a really silly complaint.

/"He was so jealous of Harry in 4th book that he abandoned Harry like an angry, edgy moron."/

He stopped talking to Harry for a while because he felt betrayed. The entire thing wasn't about Harry being in the spotlight again, but about Ron being left behind again -- and Harry not being very understanding. Read the book again, Harry is downright NASTY to Ron here; Ron just sulks and pulls away -- Harry hurls insults and throws badges at him. This entire idea that everything is Ron's fault is bull -- on the whole, Ron is a much better friend to Harry than Harry is to Ron.

Ron is the one who supports Harry when nobody else does. In first and second year, during the periods when everyone hates Harry, Ron sticks by him and becomes hated by association. In third year, Ron tries to stand up on a broken leg to what he thinks is a deranged killer, to say "if you want Harry, go through me." In fifth year, Harry is an arsehole to EVERYONE and Ron doesn't even raise his voice to him. This isn't the actions of a fair-weather friend who runs off the moment things get hard.

/"He was so jealous of Harry in 4th book that he abandoned Harry like an angry, edgy moron."/

Read the books again. Of the three main characters, Ron makes by FAR the least anti-Slytherin comments. He barely even mentions Slytherin at all, outside a few isolated incidents. Harry is the real anti-Slytherin bigot here; he tends to go on about how unpleasant the house is.
