He ate like animal. He abandoned his friends when things got tough in 7th book, he was complaining about lack of food in that adventure.

He was so jealous of Harry in 4th book that he abandoned Harry like an angry, edgy moron.

He was a stupid boy who hated Slytherin. A holier than thou syndrome is just another form of bigotry.
