Well, write him as one of the bravest kids you know - he sacrificed himself for harry and Hermione in year 1 in canon, and stood on a broken leg and told a suspected mass-murderer he had to go through him to get to Harry in year 3. But also write him as insecure, and feeling overshadowed by his older brothers. He is jealous, but not really any more than most other teenagers. He is also close in skill to Harry, and much less prone to angst. And among the trio, he's the expert for wizards, so to speak, and he grew up with six siblings.

So, should either Harry or Hermione need help or an intervention, he's the first to come to mind. He's also - as mentioned already - one of the bravest kids in school, and ready to break the rules when needed. So, while Hermione has other friends, I doubt she has a friend like Ron who will be there when it counts, even if he might annoy her at times.

As another option, you could use "Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived" by DianeCastle as an inspiration, and have Hermione crush on Ron early on - that would certainly keep him in the story as the two inexperienced teenagers dance around each other.
