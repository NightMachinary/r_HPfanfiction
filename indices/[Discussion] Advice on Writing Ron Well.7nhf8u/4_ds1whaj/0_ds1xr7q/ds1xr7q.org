Good advice from a master of his craft! Although --- you couldn't know this, of course, you'd have to have read my story, but --- "while Hermione has other friends, I doubt she has a friend like Ron who will be there when it counts"... well, that part made me chuckle a bit because Hermione's friends include the Basilisk, who has obviously been a great help so far.
