What contributions a third-year, canon-like Ron can make to a plot... that does depend a lot on what exactly the plot IS.

I do love Ron, but he's hardly a prodigy, and compared to Harry and Hermione he's not really exceptional... so it's easy to just delegate him into the "comic relief" role; be the one who stands on the sidelines and snarks, or has humiliating things happen to him cause it's funny (that did happen to him in canon, after all).

One thing that might be worth pursuing is that Ron has pretty good insincts. Unless blinded by some sort of bias (like deciding he hates Viktor Krum because Krum likes Hermione), he's generally pretty good at assessing the trustworthiness of people, places and situations. If Ron's suspicious of someone or something, there's generally a good reason to be.

Also, he's often a lot more perceptive than people, including Ron himself, gives him credit for. There was a running joke in the fandom, at least with the first four book, that Ron might be a Seer, because whenever he joked or snarked about something, or said something in jest, he usually turned out to be right on the money.

Perhaps the biggest thing Ron can do, though, is provide a counterbalance to Hermione. Usually, Hermione is the one who is rational and logical, while Ron is more likely to leap before he looks... but in some instances where Hermione gets carried away with her own emotions, Ron's the one who provides the down-to-Earth rationale. If one of them goes too far in one direction, the other will be there to try and keep them from falling over.
