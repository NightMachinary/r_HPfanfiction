You could then add an extra dimension to Ron and make him a touch of sadness. Got nothing bad to say about Mrs Weasley, she was a great mum. But for a kid, who's already overshadowed by all his siblings, I could see it being a source of hurt that she could never remember his dislikes. I mean, he's a pretty easy going guy, eats just about anything, and deals with shabby clothes pretty well, but he dislikes corned beef and maroon. I'm not even sure he got his initial on his. Ginny got decent dress robes....but she wasn't even old enough to go. So they would not have been on her supplies list. Ron got old-fashioned mouldy lace.....in maroon.

Or you could make him found a chess club.
