I like Ron as a character and with Harry moping half the time and Hermione being strung up like the guitars of Brian May, Ron was definitely a warm and much-needed comic relief. His purpose, in my eyes, was to make everything more light-hearted in an increasingly dark progression of the series. Not sure if my answer helps (as I too have a hard time writing Ron) but I thought I would give you my thoughts.
