Another piece of advice that I use for my stories: to understand canon characters a little better, I use MBTI. It really helps me understand how they think, how they process information, and a general overview of their personalities. It helps me keep them in character, also to understand how they would react in different situations. Now, MBTI is not in canon (except for Remus Lupin and Dumbledore-- JKR has typed them as ENFJ and INFJ respectively). But many people (you can search up MBTI Ron Weasley) have him typed as an ESFP, this I tend to agree with.
