Give him his own plotline of some sort. Give him another person he wants to interact with. Figure out a way he wants to interact with someone that isn't from canon. Find someone who needs help who feels they can go to him and no one else, or find someone he wants to impress or beat in some way, or get him into some kind of trouble.

Maybe Ginny is having trouble with bullying so she goes to Ron for help. Bullying is an honored tradition at Hogwarts, and she /was/ responsible in a way. Maybe she's struggling with her course material since she missed most of a year, and Hermione's teaching style seriously fails for her. I can see Hermione being worse at teaching -- she's the sort who would be very confused at people not understanding something and then she'd try to go more thorough. But Ron might listen better and come up with something that's easier to understand.

I mean, he's a solid B student at fifth year and better at graduation. He's not exactly a dunce.
