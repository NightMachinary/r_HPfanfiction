Also, Ginny didn't have the Diary from November 1992 until May 1993. Hermione began brewing Polyjuice in that bathroom sometime from mid November until mid December. She got very lucky here.

Harry had it from Jan 1993 until May 1993. In fact, the Diary was in Harry's possession longer than in Ginny's. Unlike Ginny, Harry didn't write in it and just stored it in his trunk most of the time.
