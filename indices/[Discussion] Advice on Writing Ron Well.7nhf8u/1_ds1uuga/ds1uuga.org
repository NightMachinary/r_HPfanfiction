Maybe you could get into, how creepy it would actually be having a human disguised as pet rat in your family, and maybe start a character arc for Ron, like him starting to research magic that can uncover deceptions or help with keeping secrets, you could set him on a path to be some sort of detective for lack of a better word, that could have an interesting pay off in book 4, when you look at Crouch or Skeeter. The problem with this is that you´re going off canon quite a bit and him researching stuff, doesn´t give him much stuff to do immediately, though him researching stuff in the library of his own accord, could be used for a comedic moment or two. Or to be short when you don´t know what Ron can contribute to plot, make Ron think about this himself and go from there.
