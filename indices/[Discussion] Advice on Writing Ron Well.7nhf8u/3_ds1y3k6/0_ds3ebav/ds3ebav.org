  He is the street smarts of the group, and he knows a lot about the wizarding world that Harry and Hermione doesn't.

Exactly the point I want to make. Many fanfic authors fail to see this point and use Hermione or Harry to provide certain knowledge that is more logical for Ron to know.

  He gets good grades at school, even though he likes to complain about homework.

I would personally rate his marks average (which is not a bad thing). He will not compete with hermione for the top-position in the class but neither will he compete with certain students for the bottom place.

Also Ron is a real Gryffindor. In the second book he did follow the spiders, despite his arachnophobia. In the third book he stood up against what he thought to be a murderer. (Or at least, tried to, but yeah he had a broken leg at that time). Give him a backbone.
