What does the other characters do in the story? Ron is usually helping out Harry or Hermione with their problems, and spends most of the books doing that. He is the street smarts of the group, and he knows a lot about the wizarding world that Harry and Hermione doesn't, he is usually the one to explain common magical words or things. He has a good intuition, and often notices when things are a bit off. He is also good at imitating voices and sounds. He gets good grades at school, even though he likes to complain about homework. He even does research when it's important, contrary to what his haters like to believe. He is able to change his beliefs when he learns they're wrong, and is not stuck in his ways. Ron loves chess and quidditch, and is very good at both things, he also knows a lot of quidditch trivia. He's a genuinely funny guy, but also a very kind one.
