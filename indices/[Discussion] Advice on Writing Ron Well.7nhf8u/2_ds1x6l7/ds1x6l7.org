The thing with Ron and things to do is that Ron as a character is the most social of the trio, but also the most outspoken one and definitely with a dark sense of humour. This means that it is hard to have “something to do” for him because, as you can already see in the books, Ron's acts are often enough those that could have come from anyone if only they were clever/brave/whatever enough, but came specifically from him because he is the kind of person who doesn't think about whether it is worth for him to do something for the sake of someone else but simply does it. He may not be the most loyal person ever (both he and Hermione are more or less equally loyal but in different ways, and both of them do betray Harry in different ways and for different, but always somewhat excusable, reasons), and he may not be the most [insert anything] person ever, but he does provide humour in the series, he does daring rescues and has “you can get him over my dead body” moments just because he feels something may be wrong, and ultimately he did serve his part in keeping the trio together (despite people claiming that it was Harry and only Harry).

So, let's try to make a list, shall we:

- Whenever he's present and Malfoy starts being an annoyance, he's always the first one to reach for his wand.
- He convinced the twins to take their father's car and rescue Harry because something may have been wrong; by that point he did not know enough about Harry's life to really know that wrong something was.
- He went with Harry down to the Chamber of Secrets, and while sure, it was his sister that got taken, he had to know he can't really contribute because of his wand so he went outmatched.
- Heck, he went with Harry to the Forbidden Forests, knowing there are spiders involved.
- He stood between Harry and Sirius, with a broken leg, knowing he stands no chance really.

We could go further, but I think at this point you can easily tell that there is a theme with Ron's ... things to do, so to say, in the books. I do not know what your story is about and if it even needs stuff like that, but really situations where help is needed but anyone with a proper judgment of the situation would go and hide instead are situations for Ron to shine.
