Whilst I love people sharing their recommendations, it would be much more useful if you explained /why/ you like these stories. It would let everyone else figure out if they would like them to.

As an example, I really love /The Mind Arts/. I love how its a story focused on magic (both in general and particularly mind arts). The much more academic Harry is super interesting especially since magic in that universe is so interesting. And it can maintain this whilst having a solid story and fascinating, complex characters.
