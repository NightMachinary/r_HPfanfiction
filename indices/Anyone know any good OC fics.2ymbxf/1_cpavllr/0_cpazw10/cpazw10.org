I came here to say this one. The characters are characterized very well and there are some more 'unique' or at least unusual character archetypes. The plot is very interesting, and contains a great mix of adventure, action, mystery, and even a little romance. But my favorite thing about this one is that the author has created a new original universe that still fits into the Harry Potter OC Universe. Most of the magic and creatures and institutions (schools, governments, law enforcement, etc.) are fresh and new. Definitely one of my top three, and the best original story in my opinion.
