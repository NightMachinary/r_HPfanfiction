I don't know what the fic is, but I think the quick answer is *the Prophecy*. Harry and Neville are the most likely candidates. Anyone else will more than likely require creating an entirely new character, creating an entirely new prophecy, and considering the ramifications of that on the world.

This is not something most authors want to really get into, at least from what I have seen. So normally, if Harry is not BWL/GWL in a story Neville is the child of prophecy, there is no prophecy, or Voldemort was not...well.../Voldemort/.
