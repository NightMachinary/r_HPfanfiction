I can't remember the name, but I will describe it and hope that someone can help. It's post-canon. It starts with Harry going to a bar and meeting a bizarre fairy godfather...and then Harry is catapulted into a different life, where he is/was a woodworker. And then he goes back to his other life again. I think I remember that it was well-written.
