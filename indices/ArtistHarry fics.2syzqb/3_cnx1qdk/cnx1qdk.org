  When Narcissa Malfoy calls in her life debt so that Severus can fulfill the terms of his grandfather's will and secure the Prince family estate, Harry agrees to marry Severus Snape and live with him for a year and a day. But Prince Manor hides a secret in its overgrown gardens, and Narcissa isn't helping Severus out because of her kind heart. Harry thinks he's going into the marriage with eyes wide open, but he has to maneuver around the Malfoys' machinations and come to terms with his growing feelings for Severus even as the magic in the gardens gives his life a new, unexpected purpose.
