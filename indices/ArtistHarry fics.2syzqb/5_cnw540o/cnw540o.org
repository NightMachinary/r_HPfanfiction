Not sure if it's what you're looking for, since Tonks is the central character rather than Harry, but I write/QM a choose your own adventure style fic aptly named [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tonks-quest-ii-tonk-harder.287117/][Tonks Quest]]. From the word go, the players decided that they'd rather pursue ART and FRIENDSHIP than magic or kung fu.

As a word of warning, it's both wildly AU and a crossover (China underwent its own modernization in the 1800s, Germany won WW1, Tom Riddle confessed to Myrtle's death and was sentenced to military service, Ted Tonks and Arthur Weasley built a wildly successful magitech manufacturing company together, TYPE Venus arrived in prehistory instead of TYPE Mercury, Gilgamesh found another immortality plant, and a few other things.)
