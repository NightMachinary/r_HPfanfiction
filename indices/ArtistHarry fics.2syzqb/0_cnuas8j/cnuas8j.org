In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] (Words: 1,253,480; Updated: ~7 months ago) the protagonist is being introduced as a painter. /(I haven't read the story myself, though)/

Another one is the [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sacrifices_Arc][The Sacrifices Arc,]] I guess. (spoilers) Here Harry gains a magical ability of singing like a phoenix, but this happens only halfway through the story (~3,000,000words√∑2).
