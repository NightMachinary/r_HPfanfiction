Fairly hard magic for a Harry Potter fic. Takes interesting directions with existing concepts. Harry is curious and explores branches of magic that you don't normally see in fics (divination, necromancy, unforgivables) It's not nearly as edgy as you might expect a "dark Harry" fic to be.

It's pre hogwarts and up through hogwarts. Fresh plot, 100% not cannon rehash.
