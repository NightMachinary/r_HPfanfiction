linkffn(Subversion by Myricle) has an extremely hard and inventive magic system and is also incredibly well-written. It's unfortunately dormant and probably abandoned, but it's worth reading.

linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation) is probably the closest thing to what you're looking for. A pretty hard magic system with much more development of magic than in the original series, and very fleshed out world building. It's also really long, over a million words for the entire series, and pretty competently written.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) might also be up your alley, many of the subjects have much more order and explanation than in canon. Also over a million words.

Alexandra Quick and Victoria Potter both have incredible scale, writing, and worldbuilding, but the magic in both (which again is inventive and expansive) leans very soft re: Sanderson's first law, possibly even softer than canon. Give them a shot though, the magic is not that soft and they are both exceptional.
