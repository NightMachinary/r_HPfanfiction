Aaaaigt Nice! The accidental animagus is fun, not as amazing as the Arithmancer but there is a very refreshing focus on international magic community's and thus also cultural differences and different types of magic. It is not completed at this time (sequal is ongoing as animagus at war) and the updates are irregular but still going. I would recommend it. They are writing other stuff at the same time, honey and magic is the most recent one and updated, i only read the first chapter at this time and i think they are going to dive in the wandless magic aspect. I love this writer. :)
