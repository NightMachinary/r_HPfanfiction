The Arithmancer by White squirrel and its sequels lady Archimedes and annals of arithmancy. Best fic i ever read, i come back to it once a year at the very least.

Granger centric fic. Builds: magical theory, arithmancy, spell crafting, runes and even ritual magic. It is amazing!

Dont know how to link... Sorry
