I might recommend The Prince of Slytherin. I wouldn't call it “hard magic” but it does have a /lot/ of worldbuilding relating to magic. It's also very long (over 1 million words so far and it's only on the beginning of book 4), so it definitely fits your “epic length” requirement.

Also, a few notes:\\
* I personally am not a fan of chapter one. My interest was picked up much more so by chapter two.\\
* I have no idea how much this would matter to you, but it's a lot darker than canon (worse child abuse, some characters are suicidal at times, etc).
