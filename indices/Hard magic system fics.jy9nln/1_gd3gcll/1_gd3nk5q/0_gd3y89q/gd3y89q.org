It should be noted that the whole /thing/ of "The Prince of Slytherin" is to take really overdone Harry Potter tropes and subvert them in very interesting ways. When describing it, the fic comes of as horrifically tropish, but in reality it drops some beautiful twists on you that really make you appreciate what the author is doing.

I also wouldn't go so far as to call it's magic system particularly "hard" but there's undeniably a lot of effort put in to worldbuilding and once a rule is established it sticks unless there's a very good reason for it not to.
