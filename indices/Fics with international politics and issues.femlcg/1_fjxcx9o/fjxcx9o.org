International politics play an important role in several of my stories.

In "Divided and Entwined", foreign powers meddle with Wizarding Britain in the aftermath of the war, using the ICW as a tool. There are also excusions to other countries to deal with Horcruxes. In "Patron", Dumbledore sends his brother out to deal with Voldemort's recruiting efforts in foreign countries. In "Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution", the muggleborns take power in Britain and most of Magical Europe wants to beat them down and restoire the proper order, leading to a war that covers most of of Europe. In "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis", the trio are curse-breakers seeking Atlantis, and travel through many countries to find clues - getting wanted across several borders in the process.
