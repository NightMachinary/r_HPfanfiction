Never understood the obsession with completed fics, myself. All my favourite fics are incomplete. Most fanfiction isn't about telling a story in the normal sense, it's more about exploring and playing with ideas (aka plot bunnies). Very few fanfics have any real /plot/ such that a lack of an ending leaves you unsatisfied.
