I think 90% of stories I read are actually incomplete. I'm mostly okay with that, since as you said, most story endings fall pretty flat. I'm okay with pulling the plug early so as to not have to see a great story fail to ultimately deliver. But, with incomplete stories that are awesome, being incomplete gives you a small sliver of hope that one day, the awesomeness will continue.
