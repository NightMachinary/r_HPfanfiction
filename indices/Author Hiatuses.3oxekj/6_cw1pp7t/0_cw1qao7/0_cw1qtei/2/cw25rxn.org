I would have to disagree with your conclusion about Seventh Horcrux. Having Harrymort look into the mirror of Esired andonly seeing himself is an awsome ending. Especially with him not knowing what it implies.

(Okay, writing this, i doubt that anyone ever would see them just themself in the mirror, but i still really like the ending.)
