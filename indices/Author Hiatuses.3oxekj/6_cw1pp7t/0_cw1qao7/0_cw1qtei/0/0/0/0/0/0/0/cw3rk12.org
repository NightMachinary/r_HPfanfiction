Yes, and /very much so/. The thing is, even if they haven't been finished, they're no less /enjoyable/ to read. I would say some of those incomplete fics are some of the most intriguing and best fics I have ever read. When I read a fic, the pleasure does not come from finishing it - rather, it comes from reading what is happening /right now/, regardless of if it's been completed or not.

Edit: I think linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505/1/Wit-of-the-Raven]]) is a /perfect/ example for this.
