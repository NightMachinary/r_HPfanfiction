:END:

I can think of at least a handful of self contained fics with satisafctory ending. The fics that aim to have epic scopes generally underwhelm at the end.

Two exceptions would be /After the End/ and /Hogwarts Houses Divided/, both of which end with amazingly written battle scenes. After the End, especially, had been built up for 600k+ and the ending delivered magnificently.

Backwards With Purpose I ends on a somewhat satisfactory note, even if it leaves many questions unanswered for the sequel.

Mattsilver's /Incorruptible/, maybe? It's been a while since I read it, but I think I was satisfied with the ending.

Cygnus Crux's Existence after Life ended ok-ishly.

Among the more self contained works, The Unforgiving Minute has an excellent ending. Unatoned ends just as well as could have expected. A Call to Arms, Fool Me Twice, Magic Within Magic Without, Back to the Garden, The Golden Age, Seventh Horcrux (which [[/u/Taure]] mentioned) -- all of them end rather well.

But, yeah. Satisfactory endings are the exception rather than the rule.
