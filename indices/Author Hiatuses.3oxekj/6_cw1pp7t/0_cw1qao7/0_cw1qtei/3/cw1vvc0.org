  I honestly can't think of a single complete, novel-length, good HP fanfic that had a satisfying ending.

It's probably a matter of taste, but I think all of Inverarity's work would be an exception, as would Voice of the Nephilim's. Your own /Alexandra Potter/ story ends well. For its genre (Harry/Ginny action/fluff) sib's /Awakening Power/ ends decently. Also enembee's /Conlaod's Song/.
