I honestly can't think of a single complete, novel-length, good HP fanfic that had a satisfying ending.

Most of them end with a puff rather than a bang, just announcing a conclusion that had been forgone since much earlier in the story (often right from the start).

Others take the "rocks fall, everyone dies" approach.

Others just fall a bit flat, with the drama of the conclusion not matching the level of build up.

The closest is probably the ending to the Denarian Trilogy, but even that left me feeling a bit "meh". By the time we got to the final fight, Harry had been through so many villains who were each advertised as the most epicly dangerous villain since sliced bread that the power inflation was eye-roll inducing.

Timely Errors, perhaps? I remember being vaguely happy with it, but I actually can't remember much about it at all, which doesn't bode well.

Black Comedy is a contender, but is probably too crackish to be satisfying. Same with Seventh Horcrux. If the story is too silly you can't invest emotionally, which means no real catharsis.

Stranger in an Unholy Land would have been a satisfying ending, but the sequel undermined a lot of the achievements of the first volume, retroactively souring the ending.
