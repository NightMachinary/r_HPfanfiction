While a lot of my favorite fic are indeed incomplete I have to say that a story by its definition has an ending and when a story is a good one the ending is just the wrapping around the package.\\
On top of my head I can think of "Unatoned" by SeriousScribble, the ending of the story brought a kind of twisted poetic justice that made me cackle in glee.
