Then I'm afraid your definition of a good fanfiction differs considerably with most people's. I have read two incomplete fics, and those only by accident because I was new to FF and didn't even know of the "Complete" tag, and by the time I learnt about it I was too far into Nightmares Past to give it up.

Some fanfiction is about experimenting with plot, going "Oh this would be cool", but by far the fanfiction I enjoy most goes the whole way. Those who claim it's about the journey still end up at their destination, I've found. I wouldn't ever recommend an incomplete fanfic without putting intense stress on the "incomplete" part.

Some of the greatest travesties of the fanfiction world are otherwise brilliant stories abandoned near the point of their climax by their authors. It's a horrible feeling, to me, leaving something unfinished.
