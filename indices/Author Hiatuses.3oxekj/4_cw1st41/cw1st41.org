Hiatuses are part of why it's extremely rare for me to intentionally read something that's in progress. I follow a couple of my favorite authors on Tumblr, one of whom has like three stories in progress. But she lets us know what hey plans are regarding updates, and if she needs time to cool off. I love that, I wish more authors had that kind of communication with their readers. I like knowing what's going on and knowing that the author whose work I'm enjoying isn't like dead or something.
