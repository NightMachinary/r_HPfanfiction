And why: excellent writing imho, and the characters feel true to canon to me. I like The House That Cedric Built because Astoria Greengrass is a very under-developed character in fanfiction ( unless I'm missing a lot of stories). Exile is tremendous fun watching muggle hating Draco negotiating the muggle world, growing up and wising up.
