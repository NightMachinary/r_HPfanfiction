If someone is asking for a fic with a certain theme/plot, then they are basically asking that the plot will be spoiled where that is concerned, in my opinion. It would be weird not to recommend a story doing exactly what the poster wanted because you don't want to spoil his surprise since he didn't want a surprise to begin with.
