I know of a couple that are hidden in snippets files.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8788731/5][Kings Cross Station]] by arekay, a one-shot in which Dumbledore's knowledge hoarding backfires.

Turnstile Jumper by dogbertcarroll, in which Harry chooses to go on but lets somebody else take his place. Cross-over with Southpark. Unfinished crackfic. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10491415/21][Part 1]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10491415/28][Part 2]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10491415/35][Part 3]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13064230/42][Part 4]]. /Note that part 4 is in a different snippets file than the first 3./
