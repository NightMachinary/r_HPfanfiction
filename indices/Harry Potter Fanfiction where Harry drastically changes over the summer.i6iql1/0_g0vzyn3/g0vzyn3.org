This is a Harry/Tonks where Harry trains over the summer and participates on many battles with Death Eaters. But it's a self contained summer story, it doesn't go into the next year. Edit: Although I mention Tonks, the order doesn't actually knows. I imagine most people know of this fic anyways, it gets recommended a lot...
