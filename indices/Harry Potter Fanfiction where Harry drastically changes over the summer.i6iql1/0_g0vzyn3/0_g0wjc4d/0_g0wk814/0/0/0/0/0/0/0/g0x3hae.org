Honestly don't even get me started on abandoned fics. Started a conpleted fic without realising it was in a series. 4 books long i think. Nearly 2 millions words. Abandoned needing like 2 more chapters. I was devastated

Seriously, I read a 100k fic in half a day, I'd spend more time browsing for small one shots than I would reading them!
