Tough no exact recommendations, I would suggest giving a few ficlets 25-50k words with good reviewes a read. They can be incredibly well made. Just stay away from unfinished/abandoned fics, makes your blood boil when it cliffhangers when the action starts.

Also, many 5-10k oneshots are very good. My favourite fluffy haphne is linkffn(ice cream)
