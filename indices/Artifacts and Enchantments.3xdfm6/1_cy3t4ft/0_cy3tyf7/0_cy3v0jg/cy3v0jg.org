To give two broad examples,

- Everyone who can afford it wears enchanted clothes, whether for comfort (e.g., magically light and air-conditioned), aesthetics (e.g., robes that change color and sexy robes that stay on even though basic geometry suggests that they shouldn't), and protection (e.g., enchantments that deflect some of the weaker attack spells, like the Weasley shields hats).

- Gift boxes that are enchanted so that their size and shape has nothing to do with the size and the shape of their contents. (I thought that this was a particularly nice touch.)
