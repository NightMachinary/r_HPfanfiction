My guess is maybe the MACUSA head arranges a joint meeting with whoever they consider the most important person (or people). Rather than the President, perhaps they meet with the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

"General, there's something you should know. There's Wizards in America, and their representative needs to meet with you."

"Is that all? Well, that's no sweat. I mean, hey, I've already met the Aliens, right?"
