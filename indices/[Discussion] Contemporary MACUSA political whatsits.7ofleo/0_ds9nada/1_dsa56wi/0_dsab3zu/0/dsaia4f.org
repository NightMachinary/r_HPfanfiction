Hmm... But I never got the impression wizards seemed too overly concerned or interested in Muggle politics and they just went for who they considered the most important person. I think also one of the reasons they only told the Prime Minister was because of the whole secrecy thing. If I remember correctly in the book it mentions that the Prime Minister couldn't tell anyone else because nobody would believe him. Telling the three (possibly four) people you suggested seems a bit risky, with the quite high possibility of them meeting and such.

I'm now wondering if it's possible MACUSA just wouldn't tell anyone? Fantastic Beasts is set a long time ago, but maybe the tension between wizards and nomajs could have remained to a certain degree to the present day.
