Well, the thing is, the US government is structured differently from that of the UK. The UK PM is technically a member of both the legislative and executive branches in his country, since they participate in meetings of Parliament. That's what makes me think that the MACUSA head meets with the Senate Majority Leader and Speaker of the House in addition to the President (and possibly the Supreme Court's Chief Justice, when necessary).
