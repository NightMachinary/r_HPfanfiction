Haha! /Here's/ a discussion you're not allowed to have on [[/r/harrypotter]]!

...But to my knowledge, no, there hasn't been anything posted on Pottermore indicating how MACUSA is getting along with the current administration. Assuming that they interact with Congress as well as the Executive Branch, my guess is that some higher-ups in the U.S. government (from /both/ parties, mind you) have made their MACUSA counterparts aware that the President is mostly just a blowhard and a showman, and not to let his outbursts interfere with their governance of American Wizarding society.
