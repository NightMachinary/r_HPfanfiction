I can start something like this.

Please give me a little more meat please.

Do you want him to be launched out and as a result they move somewhere else? Would you like them to attempt to move however Harry isn't able to, and as a result he lives by himself due to the blood wards seeing the Dursleys deserting the wards?

How far into the series do you want me to go? This can easily lead to strange ramifications.
