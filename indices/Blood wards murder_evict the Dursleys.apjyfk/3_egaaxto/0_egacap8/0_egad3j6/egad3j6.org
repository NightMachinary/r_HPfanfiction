  Ehh, that's actually the exact opposite direction I'd want it to go. Harry Potter's strictly defensive wards killed the person/people who were raising him, the poor thing, what were those awful muggles doing to him?

Maybe I've seen too many mugglewanking stories, but there are very, very few anti-muggle fics (believable ones, not the retarded LV/HP slash shit or the like). I've even seen some fics that have secondary characters glare at child Harry when he says that he doesn't like muggles too much, after said secondary characters rescue Harry from the shithole that is Number 4.

  Again, this didn't happen in the house.

The blood protections are not just around the house - they're around Harry himself. Harry only needs to stay in the house for several weeks each year to reinforce/renew the protections. The protection activates in a dungeon of Hogwarts after all.
