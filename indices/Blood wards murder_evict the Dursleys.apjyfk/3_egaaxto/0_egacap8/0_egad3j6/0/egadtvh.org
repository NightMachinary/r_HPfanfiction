  Maybe I've seen too many mugglewanking stories, but there are very, very few anti-muggle fics...

I mean yeah, that's probably true. Really though, this wouldn't have to be an anti-muggle fic, nor would I want it to be. Just a bit of an anti-Dursley fic.

Besides, just because it's rare doesn't that you can't look for it.

  The blood protections are not just around the house - they're around Harry himself. Harry only needs to stay in the house for several weeks each year to reinforce/renew the protections. The protection activates in a dungeon of Hogwarts after all.

They're on the house, and they're on Harry himself.

It /seems/ as though it meant to be that the house protection works against a variety of things, but the one on Harry himself only works against Voldemort.

But yeah, it's rather iffy, like many other things in the series.
