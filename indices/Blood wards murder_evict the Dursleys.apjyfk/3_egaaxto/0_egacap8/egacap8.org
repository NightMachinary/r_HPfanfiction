I agree that they don't seem as great as it seems Dumbledore wants us to believe, but...

#+begin_quote
  A house elf is able to infiltrate the house with impunity - and he thought that maiming Harry was okay since it colluded with its ideas of safety.

But he doesn't hurt Harry within the house.

  A couple of Dementors attack both Harry and Dudley with impunity in Book 5.

Again, this didn't happen in the house.

  Most of the inner circle Death Eaters and Voldemort wait just outside the house plot in Book 7 - the almighty blood protections don't do jack then either.
#+end_quote

Why would the wards do anything? The bad guys weren't attacking or attempting to get onto the property. Apparently the wards were enough to convince Voldemort and minions against just storming the house.

  Mind you, I'd like to see the scenario that you've written out, where the blood wards do their thing and Harry is eventually labelled as a muggle-killer or something by some fool or the other.

Ehh, that's actually the exact opposite direction I'd want it to go. Harry Potter's strictly defensive wards killed the person/people who were raising him, the poor thing, what were those awful muggles doing to him?

There's not really a reason for the Ministry to slander him yet, and there's that built in bias against muggles working for him in this situation.
