  So the blood wards protecting Harry are supposed to be this extremely powerful defense that renders him completely safe from Voldemort and presumably most other things as well.

They're not anywhere near as potent as people believe them to be. A house elf is able to infiltrate the house with impunity - and he thought that maiming Harry was okay since it colluded with its ideas of safety. A couple of Dementors attack both Harry and Dudley with impunity in Book 5.

Most of the inner circle Death Eaters and Voldemort wait just outside the house plot in Book 7 - the almighty blood protections don't do jack then either.

Mind you, I'd like to see the scenario that you've written out, where the blood wards do their thing and Harry is eventually labelled as a muggle-killer or something by some fool or the other.
