This fic is tagged as Snape/Hermione (it takes place after the Second Wizarding War), but honestly, they never even kiss. It reads, to me, like a Gen fic (no pairings). The backstory the author gives to Snape is fitting and realistic. I especially love the descriptions of Death Eater life and the nature of Dark magic. Unfortunately, it's a WIP, but I felt that it stopped at a place that allows it to stand on its own as a complete fic. I'm a complete Snapetard, and I adore this story:
