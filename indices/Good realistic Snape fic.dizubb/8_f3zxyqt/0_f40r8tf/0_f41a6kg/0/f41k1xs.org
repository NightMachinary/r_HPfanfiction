So far, I haven't got enough patience to get to the death of Voldemort, there was no simple straight relationship among all characters. Either gay, lesbian, or at something even more complicated (ménage à trois for Harry). I usually don't mind one or two gay/lesbian relationship, but this feels really weird.
