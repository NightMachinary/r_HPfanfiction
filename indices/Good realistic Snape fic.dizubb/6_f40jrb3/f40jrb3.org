HP-era, gen, mentors HP (but does not adopt him nor is the fic heading in such a direction): linkao3(The Hogwarts Potions Professor). Main issue given your restrictions is that, while the fic doesn't "coddle" him and retains his serious demeanor, the reason he behaves a better person is left unexplained.

I considered linking a Marauder-era fic but couldn't figure any SS-centric out that I remember reading that doesn't bash at least one of the Marauders since I don't read "bad!Snape" fics (flawed yes, but never truly dark), and while they are bullies in canon, fics like to go overboard, especially when they want to make James look bad because reasons. The closest one that comes to mind (which only has some very minor bashing) had several OCs instead, which you expressed a dislike for.
