[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11622306][Puzzle]] linkao3(11622306) is from Lily's POV, but Snape plays a major role, and his characterization in this fic is the best I've ever seen - it's nothing but nuance and complexity. Snape/Lily, canon divergent, dark.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/147439][Into the Fold]] linkao3(147439) is from Snape's POV, alternates between his sixth year at Hogwarts and two years post-graduation, and is also really thoughtful about his characterization. Mostly gen with some unrequited Snape/Lily, canon compliant.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6693841][I Know Not, and I Cannot Know; Yet I Live and I Love]] linkao3(6693841) has a premise that I admit I was skeptical of at first - Snape slowly developing a sort of friendship with Luna over the years as her teacher - but the execution sold me. Gen, canon compliant.
