As was said elsewhere in this thread, for a lot of people, HPMOR is at a level of quality where it's either the only Harry Potter fanfiction worth reading, or simply comes at the top of the list of possible recs, and not by a small margin.

For a lot of other people, for whatever reason, perhaps an inability to suspend disbelief and get into the characters? They won't be able to enjoy it.

Sounds like you're one of those, OP.
