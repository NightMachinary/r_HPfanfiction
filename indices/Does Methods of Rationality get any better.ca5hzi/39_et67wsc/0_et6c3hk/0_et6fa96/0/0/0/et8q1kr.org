Giving an unequivocal personal judgement on something is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. That just means someone is fully aware of their stance. What's the problen.?

Also the idea that the number of reviews determine the quality of a story is a bit silly isn't it?

First things first, we don't know the content of all of those reviews. So there could be a high percentage of negative reviews.

Next we have the fact that sorting by reviews is almost always biased towards longer stories with a higher chapter count. Some only review once, but there is a substantial amount of people who review each and every chapter.

I mean we could look at both sorting by Favorites and Followed (both of which I'm sure have HPMOR quite high on the list) but those have their own problems in trying to ascertain quality vs simple popularity/presence over time.
