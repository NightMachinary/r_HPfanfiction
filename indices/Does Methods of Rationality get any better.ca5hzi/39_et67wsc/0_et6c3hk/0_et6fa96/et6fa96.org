And you've, clearly, the same streak of poor judgement and reasoning.

HPMOR is the highest-reviewed Harry Potter story on all of fanfiction.net's 700,000 stories. How about you try to try to see the good in the story, instead of joining this thread's dogpiling and shitting on the story? It's pretty pathetic.

Just because you don't like something, doesn't mean it's bad.
