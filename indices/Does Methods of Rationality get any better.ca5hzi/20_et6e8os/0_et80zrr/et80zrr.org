Hahah, yeah. I actually really liked it when I first started it, it was (I thought) a humorous deconstruction of all the problems of canon.

Then it turned out the author really thought he knew a lot of stuff and was trying to educate people on his world view, and it wasn't even funny any more, and also he's wrong a lot.

(The author has literally stated that if you don't have cryonics insurance for your children, you're a bad parent.)
