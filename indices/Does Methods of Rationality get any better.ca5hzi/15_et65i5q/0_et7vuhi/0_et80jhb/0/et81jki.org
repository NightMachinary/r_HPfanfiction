Well you can lie about the criticisms that you're basing your opinions on. Like if you say "This story is bad because the characters do things that make no sense!" and the person writing that is too drunk or bad at reading to actually recognize the explanations for why the characters did those things, then the review is only "spot on" to people who are similarly bad at paying attention to story details.

Now if it's like "The humor is really cringey," that's an opinion and it might be spot on to you while not to others, but as a review of the work overall, "it's an opinion piece" doesn't shield against criticisms of why it's a bad review for anyone not just looking for something that bashes it.
