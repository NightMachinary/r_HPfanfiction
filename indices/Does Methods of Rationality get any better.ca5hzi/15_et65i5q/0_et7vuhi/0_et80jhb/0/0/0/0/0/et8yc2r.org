Sure, right in the very start of the review where it tries to summarize all the things wrong with the story:

#+begin_quote
  *Ron and Hagrid are basically dismissed out of hand in this story (Ron explicitly as being useless, Hagrid implicitly so) because they aren't intelligent enough, and Hariezer explicitly draws implicit NPC vs real-people distinctions.*
#+end_quote

This is the kind of sloppy misattribution of intent that marks reviewers like this as bad readers to HPMOR fans; the problem with insisting that the author and Harry are supposed to be the same person, and so anything Harry says the author must also believe, is that the story constantly points out Harry's flaws.

So in this particular case, the /story/ does not dismiss them out of hand just because the protagonist does. He's a flawed protagonist, and the story shows that. Harry's dismissal of Ron early on and treating him like an NPC is explicitly highlighted as a mistake when both he and Draco lost their first battle to Hermione, who used her soldiers like Ron who were good at strategy to come up with ways to defeat both of them.

This was not even subtle. Hermione literally explains this to another character right after it happens:

#+begin_quote
  "How long do you think it will take Malfoy to figure it out?" said General Granger.

  "Not long," said Colonel Blaise Zabini. "He may have already. How long will it take Potter to figure it out?"

  "Forever," said General Granger, "unless Malfoy tells him, or one of his own soldiers realizes. Harry Potter just doesn't think like that."

  "Really?" said Captain Ernie Macmillan, looking up from one of the corner tables where he was being crushed at chess by Captain Ron Weasley. (They'd brought back all the other chairs after Malfoy had left, of course.) "I mean it seems kind of obvious to me. Who would try to come up with all the ideas just by themselves?"

  "Harry," said Hermione, at exactly the same time Zabini said, "Malfoy."

  "Malfoy thinks he's way better than everyone else," said Zabini.

  "And Harry... doesn't really see most other people like that," said Hermione.

  It was kind of sad, actually. Harry had grown up very, very alone. It wasn't that he went around thinking in words that only geniuses had a right to exist. It just wouldn't occur to him that anyone in Hermione's army besides Hermione could have any good ideas.

But hey, maybe the reviewer was drunk for that whole arc. Next up:

#+begin_quote
  *Not until Hermione dies, near the end of the story, does Hariezer pick up a positive goal again (ending death) and he does absolutely nothing to achieve it.*
#+end_quote

Apparently "absolutely nothing" includes having invented the spell (his new Patronus) that allows someone to be brought back from the dead.

Again, this is not subtle. Voldemort restores Hermione's body, then gets frustrated by her remaining a corpse, and thinks that /maybe/ if he uses an electric shock to restart her body she can be restored as a muggle, but then Harry uses his Patronus and brings her back to life with her magic, at the cost of some of his own.

#+begin_quote
  "Expecto," Harry shouted, feeling the magic and the life rise up into the Patronus Charm that was fueled by both, "PATRONUM! "

  The girl in the Hogwarts uniform was surrounded by a blazing aura of silver fire, as the Patronus was born inside her.

  Harry staggered, as he felt a dip, a bite. Intuition or Tom Riddle's memory told Harry that the life and magic that had just flowed into Hermione would never return to him, either one. It hadn't been all his life or all his magic, not by a long shot, there hadn't been time to expend that much, but whatever he'd just expended was gone forever.

  And Hermione Granger was breathing, just like she was sleeping, rhythmic inhalations and exhalations. The twilight sky had dimmed further, and Harry could not see if color was returning to her, but it should have been, it certainly should have been. She looked to be sleeping peacefully, and it wasn't because being dead looked like sleeping, it was because she was asleep and her body was fine and nothing was hurting her while she slept.

  Some part of Harry, that had somehow managed not to speak up earlier, quietly pointed out that they were still in a graveyard, the recently victorious Lord Voldemort was still in control of the situation, and that his guess about Hermione wanting to be alive was just a guess.

  Harry was still smiling, as he slowly lowered his wand. The celebratory fireworks going off inside his mind were restrained, Harry wasn't screaming and running around in little circles like Professor Flitwick, but that -

  That -

  THAT, Harry said aloud inside his mind, THAT is what I call Step Two.

Maybe he was drunk through the climax of the story too, right? Or maybe he's just a bad reader who doesn't understand the thing he's criticizing. /shrugs/
