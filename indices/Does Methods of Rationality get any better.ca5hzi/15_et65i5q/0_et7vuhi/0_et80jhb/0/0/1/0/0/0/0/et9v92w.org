In the sense that opinions can be non-absolutely wrong, someone who formulates their opinions while drunk is very likely to hold incorrect opinions. You are playing language games in a determined effort to miss the point - opinion pieces can be ill-founded or well-founded, and being drunk makes for ill-founded opinions.
