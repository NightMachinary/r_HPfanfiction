It's funny how often this "comprehensive review" gets linked, despite it having half a dozen reading comprehension errors on the very first few sections.

Like, it's a clearly joke to people here that HPMOR fans think its detractors are "just too dumb to get it," but when their criticisms literally result from being unable to recount the actual facts of the story correctly, I don't know what they expect us to think.

It's fine to not like HPMOR, most of my friends don't, but I've yet to meet someone who actually hates it that's also able to articulate why in a way that shows they understood it, rather than just getting turned off by the first few chapters because Harry is too smart and obnoxious (the latter of which is a fair criticism) or who thinks the author is portraying Harry as right all the time (despite him constantly making mistakes and paying for those mistakes), or because they dislike what the story does with the characters.
