1. HPMOR is extremely controversial work. For some it is the best fanfic ever written (perhaps, even the only fanfic worth of reading), but it also figures on many lists of the worst stories ever written. See below, how everybody who dislikes it is an idiot.
2. For me there are some things which are really good and some clever ideas (e.g., actually the explanation of the scientific method is rather good), but general story is rather boring, way way too long (but that's problem of 90% of all fanfiction), and it ends in some rather weird ends.
3. Generally I think, if you don't want to get a crash course in the scientific method (and everybody should have it from time to time), it seems to me like a waste of time.
