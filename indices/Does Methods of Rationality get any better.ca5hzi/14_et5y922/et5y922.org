Define "better". It definitely gets /different/ --- in that it stops being a kinda-goofy parody of common canon and fanon tropes like the first few chapters and develops its own, more serious plot. But if you find the sense of humor and attitude of the early chapters are not to your taste, it's unlikely you'll sympathize enough with Harry in the later chapters to be much invested in said plot.
