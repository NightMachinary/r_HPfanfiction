-it's pretty widely hated on this subreddit so you may not get an objective answer -but even fans of the story like me think the first ~8 (?) chapters are terrible (i recall someone even tried a rewrite on the author's behalf)

there is a degree to which you will probably hate the whole thing if you hate the first few chapters so much. the substance improves but the style periodically regresses.
