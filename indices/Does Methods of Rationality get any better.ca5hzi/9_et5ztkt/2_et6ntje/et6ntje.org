Dude... coming into a thread talking about why people dislike the fic and saying “you're too dumb to get it” is... not in any way a good ideaaaaaaah, that's a quote whoops! Misread your post.

Yeah, I personally enjoyed the story, but I can absolutely get why someone wouldn't. The first chunk of the story especially feels bashy way too often, and while it gets better about justifying all characters' actions instead of just dropping anvils later on, and has some pretty interesting reasons for why Harry acts the way he does + runs him through character development, I can still absolutely get why someone wouldn't want to slog through that just to get to the default required. I guess my best advice for anyone who legitimately wanted to enjoy it would be to read it as effectively a crack fic at first and enjoy the humour, and not take it too seriously until it starts taking the world seriously itself. Or don't, because it's totally fine if you just don't have any interest in it!
