Uhuh, uhuh, what planet are you visiting from? Most people's issue with that story (including my own) is that the characters are cringy and unlikable, the writer clearly has an arrogance streak a mile wide, and it's set up to point out how a culture that is thousands of years old is really just made up of a bunch of idiots playing with magic sticks while the 'intelligent' MC is the only one who can find his own arse without use of a mirror. The writer is like every over-compensating 'intellectual' constantly giving long winded lectures on why he is brilliant and his ideas are brilliant. The lecture may be well written, the grammar correct with impeccable references, but it being delivered by an egotist makes it unpalatable to most audiences.
