What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Fanfiction Academy, and I've been involved in numerous secret writings on AO3, and I have over 300 confirmed fics. I am trained in gorilla writing and I'm the top reviewer in the entire fanfiction.net website. You are nothing to me but just another flamer. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of readers across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your fic. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed writing, but I have access to the entire collection of fanfiction archive and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
