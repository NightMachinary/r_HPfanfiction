I mean, I think a lot of it is less about intelligence and more about inside knowledge. I liked HPMOR but it's full of jokes that will only work if you know what they're referencing in the first place.

But in general, I think HPMOR's biggest flaw is just that at times it gets into full 'teaching' mode, as in, it stops being a story at all and just becomes an essay on whatever Harry is ranting about for a few pages. The humour's alright with me, but that's one of the most subjective things that exist.
