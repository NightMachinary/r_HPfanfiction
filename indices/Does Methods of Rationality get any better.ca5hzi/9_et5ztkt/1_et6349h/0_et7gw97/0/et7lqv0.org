Yeah, but I realise a lot of people may go "ok, I'm here for the Potter adventures though, why are you explaining behavioural psychology to me?".

Besides, I don't know about the psychology parts, but I slightly disliked how it presents the bit about timeless physics as if it was somehow accepted science. Other times EY dumps on us his personal theories as fact. They're very well informed theories of course - the guy's not some crackpot, he's an actual scientist - but still, I think it's a bit sneaky to mix them up in what is otherwise presented as an educational sort of piece. If I'm writing for laymen, I would only present as fact the most accepted of science. Everything more speculative, if I have no way to frame it as such, I would just not mention.
