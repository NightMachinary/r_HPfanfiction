Teaching mode can be good, because it shows how a lot of these concepts can be applied to (something closer to) real world scenarios, instead of just something interesting that someone wrote in a book. Though making it so your readers' eyes don't glaze over because they already know about, say, the Milgram experiments, while also making sure their eyes don't glaze over because you include too much statistical detail is a real challenge.

It has vague resemblance to Larry Niven's style of having the thought processes of the character constantly analyzing everything around them. Many people don't like that, and many people clearly do.
