I can't get over the fact that people were literally using this explanation in the [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c2r62o/the_absolute_worst_popular_fic_youve_ever_read/]["Worst "Popular" fics of HPfanfic"]] thread from a few weeks ago.

For accuracy's sake, here was the full defense of HPMOR. It sounds something a Rick and Morty fan would post on Facebook, tbh.

  "Why does this subreddit hate HPMOR so much? The elements of the story (writing, plot, characters, foreshadowing, worldbuilding) are objectively excellent. Is the story just legitimately too intelligent for the majority of the people who read Harry Potter fanfiction? I'm being serious here."
