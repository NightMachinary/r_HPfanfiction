  The Rick and Morty meme isn't supposed to mean that different stories have singular demographics. It's supposed to satirize the cringe worthy fans that believe they are somehow special or "elite" because they like a specific thing. That only they can appreciate it because their smarter than those who simply "don't get it".

Nobody has any evidence showing that HPMOR fans view themselves this way or that they'd be wrong if they did. That's the point my broad statement was meant to highlight.

That people in this subreddit are quick to see the story's fan as arrogant and cringey just for liking the story and thinking it's got fun, smart ideas implies tremendous insecurity.

This is the equivalent of linking to [[/r/iamverysmart]] when someone mentions going to college; it's making fun of someone for getting an A on a test; it's grounded in an expectation that nobody sensible can earnestly like the story, and a fear that if we acknowledged their enjoyment is reasonable it might imply they're somehow superior to us.

It's a grossly paranoiac attitude, and one that in my experience is disproportionately common among those who've got good reason to feel intellectually insecure. They can't share in the appreciation for the work that others feel, and so desire to tear it down.

I don't think a healthy fanfiction subreddit would have regular bashing threads such as OP's reach its the top of its front page for a story like this that's been positively received by some absolutely fantastic authors in the community, but that's the state of the subreddit we've got. Do you really not see a problem with that?
