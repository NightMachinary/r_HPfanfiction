Did you forget the comment you initially responded to? They brought an exact quote from someone who declared this entire community too unintelligent to understand and enjoy the story. That's the exact sort of arrogance that the copypasta mockingly represents. That there is some sort of requirement to be able to enjoy the content. That the people who don't like it can't possibly have reasons not to like it outside of being to stupid to understand the story.

I'd be fine having an actual dialogue about the story discussing the pros and cons but every time I've thrown out my subjective opinion on this story some diehard fan comes out of the woodwork to tell me that the subjective aspects of the story are objectively great because grammatically and technically it's well written so I'm apparently a moron for not liking the characterization, the overall plot, and the tone.

I don't see how you could possibly read throw the thread that was linked by the person you responded to and some of the replies in this thread and deny that at least some people who LOVE this story fall under that cringe worthy elitist stereotype that the Rick and Morty meme mocks.
