They didn't declare the community too unintelligent to understand and enjoy the story without justification, they did so as an attempt to explain the weekly hatefests it receives. When there is this degree of dislike for a story, we need something more than random idiosyncratic preferences to appeal to. Based on the content of their criticisms, I think it's reasonable to think that a lot of the story's haters are driven by feeling condescended to, like they believe Yudkowsky was writing arguments for the purpose of mocking them or brainwashing them. I also think that such a stance is unreasonable, and its prevalence is much better explained by an intolerance of shamelessly bold argumentation in the audience than by the story's actual problems being so severe. It is simply obvious that we are not meant to swallow many of the positions HJPEV advances, and yet hostile audiences regularly appeal to them as a justification for hating the story, because they feel uncomfortable seeing them.

That isn't an argument driven by arrogance. Not all arguments of the form "some people hate X because they're not its intended audience" are wrong or boastful showboating, even when the intended audience is one that's intelligent and not intellectually insecure. You can't use someone saying that the hate only makes sense if it's driven by resentment as a justification for the resentment, at least not without first showing they're wrong.
