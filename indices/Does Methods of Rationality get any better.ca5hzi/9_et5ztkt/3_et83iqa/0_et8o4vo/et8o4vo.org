I don't get where you're getting intimidation from. Are we not allowed to dislike characterization without some sort of inferiority complex now?

I think the author achieved what he wanted with the characterization but I think the end result was a simply unlikable character. So I see his character as an asshole.

The Rick and Morty meme isn't supposed to mean that different stories have singular demographics. It's supposed to satirize the cringe worthy fans that believe they are somehow special or "elite" because they like a specific thing. That only they can appreciate it because their smarter than those who simply "don't get it".

You really need to stop throwing out blanket statements though. I'm fine with a philosophical debate, I'm fine with discourse and theory being a major part of a stories plot development. However I simply disliked the presentation. There is a way to present a philosophical debate between characters without it feeling so pretentious. HPMOR never seemed to bother trying to avoid doing so. So I decided to read something else instead.
