I think HP MOR is the most contentious fic this site has. Every three months or so, it will come up again, and some people will discredit it, while others will sing its praises.

Honestly, it requires a certain personality and mindset to like it I think, and if you don't fall into the category, you're just not gonna like it. Personally I enjoy it, though I admit it could be better written. I still really enjoy the concepts it employs and the way it handles problems and revelations. It is the first of the so called 'rational fiction' genre, and as such is far from polished, but it is certainly interesting if you are the kind of person that finds that thing interesting.
