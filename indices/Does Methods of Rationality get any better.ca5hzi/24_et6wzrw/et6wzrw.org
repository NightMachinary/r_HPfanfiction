I have tried to read, and listen to the podcast, on multiple occasions and it's just so rough. I personally have trouble reading any type of story that doesn't hook me within the first 2-3 chapters. I know I am missing out but even stories that have a huge following but start slow are just painful for me to try to get through and this was one of those stories.
