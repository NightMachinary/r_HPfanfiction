Agreed, for the most part. There are some points in the story where other characters stop Harry and say, "Whoa there, you're getting ahead of yourself" and stop his overthinking arrogant nonsense for a moment.

I'm a fan of 'clever' humor that drives you in circles with ridiculous unnecessary long-winded logic, so it was a great fic, in my opinion, until I got bored and ditched it around chapter 72. Like I get bored with most fics after a certain word count. I think Harry reigns in his arrogance and overthinking somewhat after a while, and you definitely see consequences to what Harry thinks is /absolutely the right answer/, but the long-winded logic and clever humor remain.

But YMMV. People either love it or hate it, apparently.
