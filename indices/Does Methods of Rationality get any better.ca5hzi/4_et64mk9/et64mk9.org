TBH, I find so-called rationalist fics in general to be insufferable. They are little more than page after page of the writer finding all the plot-holes or narrative inconsistencies of a given story; then transforming the main character into their mouthpiece to lecture all the other characters (and by extension the reader) on how to fix them. As if they were the first person to ever notice these issues with the original work.

Only good one I ever read was Friendship is Optimal, and that was because the author's know-it-all mouthpiece was an AI, so it's all encompassing knowledge and lack of humanity made narrative sense.
