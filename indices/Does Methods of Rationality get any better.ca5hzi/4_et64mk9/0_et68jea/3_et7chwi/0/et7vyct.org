I've read the Twilight books before I read Luminosity and I don't think it had any big Take Thats, though I might have missed some since it had been some years in between and I didn't remember the source completely.

HPMOR seems to go out of its way to show us how stupid the Wizarding World and anyone in it is, which Luminosity (and Radiance) just don't.
