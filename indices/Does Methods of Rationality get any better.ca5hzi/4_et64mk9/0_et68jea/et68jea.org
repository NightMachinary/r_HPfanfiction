That's why you should stick to /rational/ fics, instead of rationalist fics. Rational fics tend to focus more on storytelling than on "educating" the readers, and as a result are way less pretentious and condescending.

In rational fics:

- Characters: solve problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

- Goals and motivations: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

- Worldbuilding: the fictional world follows consistent rules.

Sounds long-winded, but it's just a story where the plot makes sense and you don't go, "Hang on, why did Harry have to wear the locket in the tent?" when you finish the story. Obviously, some stories go too far by turning human characters into an Optimizer Prime, so logical and utilitarian they're basically emotionless sociopaths. But at least you get to avoid most of the HPMOR's.
