Referencing /Worm/ and Wildbow in this corner of reddit is kinda like referencing that hot new release /The Fellowship of the Ring/ on [[/r/fantasy][r/fantasy]], but I feel like it's worth mentioning. Wildbow, somewhere, talks about this directly, that his stories are often mentioned as prime examples of rationalistic fiction, but he never intended it as such and he gets a lot of grief from people nitpicking him over minutia because of that perception.

I feel the best stories that are often lumped into the 'rational' characterization are ones where characters are consistent, pacing is measured, the problems faced are complex, and the reader is rewarded by close examination of the work.
