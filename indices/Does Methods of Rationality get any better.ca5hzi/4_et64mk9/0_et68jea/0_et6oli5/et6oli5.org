I think Pokemon: The Origin of Species is a good example of something in the middle, too? It's probably closer to ‘rationalist' in that it features an explicitly scientific protagonist and makes use of the story for tangential learning, but it addresses the whole world through that lens - instead of dropping anvils like “How dumb is it that people don't just fly over forests dropping pokeballs en masse” or something, it instead just says “Okay, I'm making a certain version of this setting that meets the story's needs” and explores that without trying to make fun of the original games.
