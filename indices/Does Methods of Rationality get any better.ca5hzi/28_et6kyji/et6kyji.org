I love it, so do many others. And then many hate it, too, and thats ok, you dont need to love everything popular out there. There are plenty of classics out there that divide my family into camps of love and hate. The sad part, in my opinion, is that people who dislike HPMOR cant leave it alone. Its like Twilight or 50 shades, I suppose - bad litterature that people love to hate. I used to hate on Twilight too since I found it cringey and stupid but now Im in the camp "I like that you are reading anyrhing at all, even if its not my taste I will support you if it results in you reading more".
