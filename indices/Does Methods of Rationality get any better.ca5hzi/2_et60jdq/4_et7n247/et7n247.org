For me Big Bang Theory is cringe but HPMOR was fun. The reason why I found BBT cringe is that it tries to make nerd/scientist humour but from the outside, without really understanding how nerds or scientists tick. Many things can be said of Eliezer Yudkowski, but not that he's not a nerd or a scientist. HPMOR can come off as petulant or self-important, but it never gave me the impression that Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres isn't a believable insufferable little nerd. He's grating at times, but he's meant to be, though that still can be a deal breaker since you're stuck reading about him.
