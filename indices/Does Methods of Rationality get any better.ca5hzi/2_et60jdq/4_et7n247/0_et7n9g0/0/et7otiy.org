For me MOR is at its best when it's either in "Harry thinks he's smart but he's actually a huge dork" mode or in straight-up battle mode. The whole armies business is a lot of fun, with plenty of clever resolutions and strategies. My least favourite bit is probably the Azkaban trip, as that's the most contrived of all arcs IMHO, since it requires Harry to be just downright stupid to agree to the thing in the first place.
