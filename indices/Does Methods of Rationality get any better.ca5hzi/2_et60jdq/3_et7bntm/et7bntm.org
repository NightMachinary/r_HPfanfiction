Astonishingly, when we had The Incident of EY trying to get us all to talk about how great HPMoR was, a while ago, it turned out that he thinks he has written a strikingly progressive, left wing piece of literature that we all hate because we are all, apparently, right wing.

You could have knocked me down with a feather.

I wonder if fans of The Big Bang Theory also think it is somehow left wing, and that all the mockery comes from the right?
