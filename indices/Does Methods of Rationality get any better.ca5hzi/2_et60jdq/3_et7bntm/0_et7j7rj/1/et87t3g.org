  Just blank all the angry screaming about the author out of your mind, look at the story as a story, try to follow what's going on in-universe, and forget all the allegations of invisible, unfalsifiable evil intentions going on behind the scene. I'm sad that so many people are coming into this fic with blatant lies about the author's grand malevolent intentions twisting their interpretation of what's meant to be fun and chaos. I meant the story as a story.
