Yeeeaaaaaah, the ‘purpose' of that line is meant to be “look at how messed up the world Draco was raised in is”, but it's still... pretty gross? Especially when you look at Yudowsky's other writings and see that he keeps jumping to rape for some reason. Like dude, you can use other examples to show moral relativism based on what can be reasonably be expected from someone based on their upgringing, instead of jumping to /rape./
