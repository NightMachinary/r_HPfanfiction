  Draco wasn't a psychopath. That was the sad and awful part, knowing human psychology well enough to know that Draco wasn't a monster. There had been ten thousand societies over the history of the world where this conversation could have happened. No, the world would have been a very different place indeed, if it took an evil mutant to say what Draco had said. It was very simple, very human, it was the default if nothing else intervened. To Draco, his enemies weren't people.

  And in the slowed time of this slowed country, here and now as in the darkness-before-dawn prior to the Age of Reason, the son of a sufficiently powerful noble would simply take for granted that he was above the law, at least when it came to some peasant girl.

I would say it's a far more realistic interpretation of how wizards/purebloods would likely be raised than is usually seen. The entire point is that the book tries to be realistic about that sort of thing, and then look at realistic effects from such causes. As opposed to other fiction that never looks at secondary effects, especially things like secondary uses for technologies introduced to solve a plot problem.
