I remember the story Patron having a similar idea there. It was never made explicit, but there were some points where it was implied Draco was raping muggle girls after kidnapping them with the imperius curse, and then obliviating them...or just murdering them. But that story is much darker and with more dense world building than the comedy that MOR is supposed to be.

Rape is a seriously dark topic for MOR, seeing as I always saw that fic as a comedy full to bursting with 'clever' humor meant to make your head spin following the logic. But then again, MOR has been around for some years. It might not have hit the 'yikes' button as much as it does nowadays. (of course it did hit the yikes button, just maybe not as often, to be clear)
