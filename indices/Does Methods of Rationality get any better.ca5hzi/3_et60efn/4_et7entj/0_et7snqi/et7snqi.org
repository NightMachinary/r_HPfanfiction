Being a bigot in one thing doesn't automatically make you a rapist. The idea of Lucius teaching Draco that rape is something he should do is still dumb to me. And if he really did, then it wouldn't come across as rape to Draco. He'd believe it was his right, just as many people irl believe married couples can't rape each other.

Him outright saying he was going to rape Luna just comes off as the same edgy shit so many mediocre authors put into their books to make things "intense", when really it's just cheap and lazy.
