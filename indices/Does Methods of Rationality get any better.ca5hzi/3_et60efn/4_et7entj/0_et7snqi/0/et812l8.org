I don't think it's the best thing that could have been included and wish the author had instead just put "murder her," but Lucius doesn't have to "teach" Draco that rape is a thing to do for Draco to think it's okay. Most rapists are not explicitly taught that rape is okay; they just develop an attitude of disregard for the desires of others over their own, particularly when those others are more literal "others" as in class systems.
