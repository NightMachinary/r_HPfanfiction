He appears to ignore it in the moment. It's actually the moment where Harry realises he's made a giant mistake about the kind of person Draco is, and the kind of society he's entering into. He then sets about trying to deradicalise Draco.

Like, MoR is an acquired taste, and it took me a very long time to trust that it realised Harry was an arrogant git a lot of the time, who is fucking dangerous to himself and others. I 100% respect that most people will not want to read 100k plus of fiction in order to get to that payoff, even if I enjoyed it.

But that is the point where the story turns from being a superficially comedic takedown of the original canon to being a much darker, more serious examination of its implications, and the story very much does fully engage with how fucked up that is, AND how fucked up it is that Harry chooses to address it with deception and trickery.
