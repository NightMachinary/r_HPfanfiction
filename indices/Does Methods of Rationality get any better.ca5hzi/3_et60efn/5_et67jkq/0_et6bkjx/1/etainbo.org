It's not a comedy - that's the line where it turns from superficial comedy to something much more serious, and it remains predominantly drama and political intrigue for the next 100+ chapters.

​

It's okay if you think it's gross and didn't like how it was used. I'm on the fence about the execution in that specific moment, too. And it's stuff like that that meant it took me a long time to trust it as a piece of fiction. Ultimately, I do like it, but I rec it to others with a lot of caveats because it honestly does take hundreds of thousands of words to get to the payoff where you realise a lot of the shit you thought was self-satisfactory smarter-than-thou bullshit was actually meant to come across that way. And if it pisses me off when people tell me to watch an entire season of a TV show to "get to the good bits" I'm sure as shit not gonna pull that same trick with fanfiction.

​

But the purpose of that line wasn't humour, and rape is not prevalent in the story. I think that's the only explicit reference to it.
