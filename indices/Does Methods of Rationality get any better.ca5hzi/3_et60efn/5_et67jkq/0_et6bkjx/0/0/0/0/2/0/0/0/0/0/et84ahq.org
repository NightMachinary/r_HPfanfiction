I watched Ralph Breaks the Internet last week. It's definitely a comedy. It still has Vanellope yelling that a true friend would never do what Ralph did, throwing away (and breaking) the friendship charm she'd been carrying around for years, and running away from him. Plus her agreeing to stay with a giant monster forever so that he would let Ralph go, Phantom of the Opera style, and Ralph refusing to accept that and having a serious discussion with the monster about letting friends be independent. Those parts were not at all humorous. It's still unmistakably a comedy.
