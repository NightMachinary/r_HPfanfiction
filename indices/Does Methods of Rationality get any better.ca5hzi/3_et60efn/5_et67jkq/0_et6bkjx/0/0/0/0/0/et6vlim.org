Well this is what the auther wanted to create.

Yudkowsky wrote the story to promote the rationality skills he advocated on his site LessWrong. Yudkowsky chose Harry Potter because "I'd been reading a lot of Harry Potter fan fiction at the time the plot of HPMORspontaneously burped itself into existence inside my mind, so it came out as a Harry Potter story. ... there's a large number of potential readers who would enter at least moderately familiar with the Harry Potter universe." He states that his work on rationality "informs every shade of how the characters think, both those who are allegedly rational and otherwise". He also used it to assist the launch of the Center for Applied Rationality, which teaches courses based on his work.
