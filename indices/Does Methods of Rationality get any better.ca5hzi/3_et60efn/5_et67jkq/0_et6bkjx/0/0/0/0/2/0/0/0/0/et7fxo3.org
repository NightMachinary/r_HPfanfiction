Have you never read or watched a comedy with very serious parts? Even cartoon kid movies advertised as comedies have serious parts and horrible violence.

The other tag there is drama. So at most, the fic claims that it is centered around drama and comedy. That allows for a very large portion of the fic to be not comedy, and it does not imply at all that it's meant to be light hearted.

If you go to watch or read a drama/comedy expecting pure fluff, you've got the wrong expectations. If you expect every part to be light humor, you must be unfamiliar with the range of comedies can have, particularly drama comedies.
