Yeah, it has a different tone than a child's comedy. Not surprising. There are a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedic_genres][wide range of comedy sub-genres]].

It's labelled as a drama humor fic. It leans far more towards drama. Perhaps the tags are misleading, but they do not imply that the fic is a light-hearted comedy, and there's definitely no reason to feel like every line is there to make you laugh.
