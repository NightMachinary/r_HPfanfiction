MOR is written where the author imposes what he thinks about everything on you, instead of just letting you think for yourself.(same with another popular work , partially kissed Hero) and that's not my cup of tea... But there's a lot of popular fics I think are attrocious..... What the author of MOR said and most people have is true the witing gets better about 5-10 chapters in if you're in chapter 11 and still don't like it probably not the book for you
