It's hard to explain and kinda relies on Narcissa getting some extra character development. The way I see it playing out is sort of a parallel to Andromeda and Ted Tonks, but where Narcissa follows family obligations/expectations and marries Lucius rather than following her heart, then later something spurs a change in that situation to get them together. You could probably replace Remus for some other character and still make the plot work, but Remus is a developed character and his love life is already an existing plot point to build off of and just makes it a bit more interesting overall compared to Generic-Male-Love-Interest-Number-2.
