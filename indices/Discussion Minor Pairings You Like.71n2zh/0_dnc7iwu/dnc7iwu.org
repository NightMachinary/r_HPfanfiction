Narcissa/Remus - This just has so much potential.

Snape/Lily Doll - He's obsessed with her. There's no way he hasn't tried to fill that void.

Fudge/Umbridge - Nightmare fuel, I know, but it just works.

Sirius/Anything with tits - Womanizer!Sirius is just fun to read, if a little cliche.

Lily/harem - GodlikeHaremMaster!Harry has to get it from somewhere right? Also, I've taken a shine to BadassGenius!Lily.

Bill/Tonks - Much more acceptable age range and they seem like they would get along.

Ginny/Luna - Childhood friends reconnecting trope anyone?

Fem!Ron/Fem!Draco - Involves gender-flipping and blind dates. Have the twin's pranks gone too far?
