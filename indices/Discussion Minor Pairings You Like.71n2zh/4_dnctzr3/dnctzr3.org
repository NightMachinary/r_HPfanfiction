I have a lot of affection for Severus Snape/Argus Filch, primarily because of the work of Delphi. Delphi really examines Snape's working-class, Northern background in a way that a lot of writers don't really grasp, and the similarities between him and Filch are really drawn out in these works.

I think a subtlety of Snape's character that can be hard to grasp when you're not from the UK is that like... So Snape (and Lily) are from a town called Cokeworth, which JKR has expanded on [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/cokeworth][Pottermore]] - Cokeworth is an industrial town in the Midlands, around what we call "[[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blackcountry/uncovered/what_is.shtml][the Black Country]]". Judging by how poor Snape was as a child, we can pretty much guess that Tobias was a worker in one of the factories and earned very little (this was pre-Thatcher, so that would only get worse in the coming years).

Class in the UK is /everything/ at times, and when you're from an area like the Black Country or Merthyr Tydfil, somewhere that's super industrial but started dying down in the 20th century, it really affects the way the world is around you. There's a lot of poverty because you had entire families that used to all be involved in industry, and then they all got the rug pulled out from under them when the mines and the factories all started closing down. You're not even working class, then, you're less than that - you're benefits scum.

So like, growing up, Snape wouldn't just have been hated by his father and neglected by his mother at home; he likely would have had a very difficult time of it in general, and a lot of that would be as a result of his economic class. The worst thing about being working class is how identifiable you are - Snape probably had an accent, he was dirty, he was unkempt, his clothes didn't fit him, etc. It didn't matter how good he was at Potions or at Hexes, because people would see him first.

And there's just a wonderful parallel with Filch, who like... He's a Squib. Class is very important in the wizarding world (we can see that most notably with the mockery of the Weasleys), but if you're a Squib, you're automatically on the lowest rung. What's the point of being pleasant to people if everyone fucking hates you anyway?

Delphi's writing of the pairing is just really great to me 'cause like, you're aware of how unhealthy the two of them are, how buried they are in their own issues and histories, how fucked up they both are - and it's just written /so/ well. Especially given that like...

The thing about Snape as a character is that you can really love him and you can understand what made him the way he is, but you don't have to make excuses for him or act like everything he ended up doing was okay. He can be a complicated, horrible man, and you can /enjoy/ that; Filch much the same.

My favourite fic by Delphi for the pairing is probably ao3link([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2480741]]) , which is Needs Must. It's rated E, but it's not smut, there's just some sex in it, and I really love the way it looks into Snape's psyche and the way they settle into a relationship with each other.

Then, I really like Severus Snape/Lucius Malfoy.

They're really completely fucking different in every way, and I like the idea of Lucius immediately clocking this powerful, genius little ink blotch of a first year and trying to help him along a little bit. The idea of Lucius taking on a kind of mentor-role through Severus' time at Hogwarts, and then after Hogwarts that perhaps becoming a sexual relationship, like... It's so interesting to me.

The way Snape talks in the books is so full of shit and obviously performative - he basically talks in a very quiet almost whisper all of the time, saying all of this dramatic nonsense, and I honestly wouldn't be surprised if everything from his neutral accent to the way he buttons up all his sleeves was a distraction he made up under Lucius' vague tutelage.

Lucius is just so rich and aristocratic and so far removed from any real fucking work; Snape is dusted with smoke and smog and has known hardwork all his life. And yet both of them come from fathers who were /exceedingly/ horrible people, ended up very high-up in the esteem of Voldemort, and ended up in positions of heavy influence in wizarding society once we come to Harry (Snape, admittedly, unwillingly).

I just find the dynamic there to be so interesting to think about.

And then Severus Snape/Gilderoy Lockhart. I don't know, I was rereading The Boy Who Died A Lot recently ( linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/670548]]) ), and there's a bit where Snape is telling himself, "You can't be serious." about being interested in Lockhart, who is such an obscene narcissist...

Again, there's a huge disparity between their positions, their styles, their classes, and I'd just find the dynamic so interesting.

I appreciate that a lot of people really hate Snape, or they only like him when he's placed through this lens that like, he was always the victim (and then pairing him with Hermione or Lily), but like... The wonder of him, for me, is in that he's such a flawed, nasty man who's in so much pain that the idea of people being kind to him is absolutely inconceivable, so why should he bother to try to connect with people himself?

It seems a shame to waste a character like that on two-dimensional portrayals.
