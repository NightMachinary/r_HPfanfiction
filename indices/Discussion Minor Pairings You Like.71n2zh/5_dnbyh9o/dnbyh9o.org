Pairings that I love that are minor: None of these are canon of course, just really like them.

Rita Skeeter/Gilderoy Lockhart. They just make way too much sense together in my opinion.

Luna Lovegood/Lavender Brown: I tend to ship them after the war, when Greyback attacked Lavender. Strange ship I know, but really enjoy it.

Rodolphus Lestrange/Narcissa Black: My headcanon is that Rodolphus had a crush on Narcissa but Lucius asked her to marry him first.

Padma Patil/Anthony Goldstein: I just find the pairing to be cute, the difference in their cultures and everything as well could be interesting to tackle in a fanfiction.

Barty Crouch Jr/Regulus Black: Another weird random ship, but in my headcanon they were together for a bit at least.
