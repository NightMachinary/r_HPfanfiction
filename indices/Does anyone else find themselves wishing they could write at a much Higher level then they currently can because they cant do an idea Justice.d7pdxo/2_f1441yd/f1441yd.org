Literally every day

EDIT: Adding some "for examples"

For example, I've got this idea for a /Worm/ fanfic called "canon fodder" that's a series of one-shots. It takes all the names announced as deaths during Endbringer fights and gives you a little 5k-25k word peek into their life. Who were they? Why did they answer the call to fight an Endbringer? Some were heroes, some villains, some just trying to get by. But when humanity itself called out its desperate need, they answered, and paid the ultimate price.

I just can't think of enough good ideas and express them with emotional heft.

For example, I've got this idea for a /Game of Thrones/ fanfic about The Night King being reborn as Bran. I wrote the first two chapters ([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-night-bran-got-peggy-sue-crack.768275/][first-draft-ish posted here]]) but it's just not as funny as I want it to be. I've written another two chapters but they're garbage and I can't get them to work.

For example, I've got this idea about a time-looping Harry that's a sequel to "Sisyphus," which is amazing and you can read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651][here]]. Sisyphus ends on a down note, and I've got the basic outline of how to write a sort of "second half" that wraps it back around to a happy-ish ending. But I can't do it justice.

For example, I've got this idea about a jumpchain-style protagonist who moves from one world to the next, and as he does so he gets plopped into the head of a main character. He gets all of that character's powers and even drags a wee bit of past powers with him. The catch is that he also brings the souls of all past characters along, and every single one of them is a fundamentally broken person.

So by the seventh or eighth jump, you've got this whole group of sad, broken men all living in a mental space together trying to find some growth or solace or way home or something. Sort of a /Twelve Angry Men/ or /Glengarry Glen Ross/ but instead of jurors or salesmen they're all struggling with how to cope with being stuck in the head of an eleven year old Harry Potter. And Harry's trying to figure out how to deal with the fact that he went from having basically no real family to having a whole bunch of fathers/older brothers overnight.

A terrible first draft of the first chapter is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-wandering-fanfic-si-harry-potter-multi-cross-worm-star-wars-etc.665851/][here]].

I get ideas all the time for self-insert fics but where the SI ends up in the body of someone who makes them into an impaired person. So they're not the stereotypical fix-fic-speed-run protagonist. Instead, they struggle with the addiction or disability of the body and brain they get plopped in to. For example, having to [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/must-love-dogs.612788/][think with a dog's brain]] or having to deal with a [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/an-unfortunate-insertion-worm-squealer-si.694075/][hideously drug-addicted]] body (both /Worm/ stories).

Unfortunately, these are both stupid and not executed terribly well. The dog one was fun to write and had a few funny moments that I'm actually proud of having written and enjoy re-reading, but overall they're just... /bad/ compared to the beautiful castle in the sky that only exists in my head.
