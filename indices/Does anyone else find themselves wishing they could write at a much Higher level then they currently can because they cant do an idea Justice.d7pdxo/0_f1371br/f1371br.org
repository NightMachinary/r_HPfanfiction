I take it the Goblins are using a passive magic effect similar to the effect that wearing the locket Horcrux had on the trio to increase the feeling of anger,resentment, insecurity,ect that Fem!Harry advises are feeling towards her?

As for friendly goblin tropes thing that could be used screw Fem!Harry over.

1.time dilation That is Normally used to help Harry turn into a super wizard over the summer could be used to extended the time Fem!harry is in their Goblins custody.

2.the Occlumency Ritual the friendly Goblin use to help fem!harry could be used to make sure that Fem!Harry never forgets.

3.The goblin had the philosophers stone in the bank for a time, if they learnt how to make them then the Elixir of life could be paired with Time dilation.

4.The Super goblin healer could be used to heal any damage done to Fem!Harry but I think OP already covered that.

Their Are more ways that friendly goblin use to Normally help Harry that I just can't remember right now.
