Every writer started off as shit. Honestly, there's nothing for it but to keep at it and put yourself out there. Write, find people (either in person or online) who are interested in reading it and have them critique and comment on your writing. I've taken creative writing classes in college just for fun, and that was basically all it was.

Its a pretty common experience for fanfiction writers to look back on stuff they wrote years back and be embarrassed by how bad it is (I certainly have). But really, that's a good thing, because it shows just how much better you've gotten.
