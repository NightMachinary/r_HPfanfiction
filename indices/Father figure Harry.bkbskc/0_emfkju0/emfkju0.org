There's a bit in linkffn(The Return of the Marauders) and the fic is ok-ish. Nothing fantastic but good enough to pass time.

These are fics with Harry as a dad linkffn(Grow Young with Me; What we lost; Found in the Ashes; Beltane Child; the little child to lead him)

While there's a lot of fluff in GYWM, there's a lot of angst in What we Lost, but they are all mostly lighthearted. GYWM is my favourite fic all time, all fandoms. I simply love it.
