Actually harry was short as a kid but was about as tall as his father by deathly hallows. Its mentioned that dudley and his friends liked to beat on harry thats why he was so quick at dodging and running away. Also petunia tries to hit him with a soapy frying pan in of the early books. Hermione was seen as plain until she put serious effort in before the yule ball. No real mention of her appearance after that that i can recall other than krums saying whats the point of his fame if all the good looking girls are taken referencing both hermione and ginny.
