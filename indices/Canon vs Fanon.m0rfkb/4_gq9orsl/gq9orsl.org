I'm sorry. I just have to say something about the Dursleys. Even if we don't read between the lines in Canon (which we should), keeping a child in a cupboard IS NEVER OKAY!! That, by itself, is enough to constitute child abuse, and we shouldn't normalize such behavior by saying it isn't abuse. That's not to mention the many hints we are given that Harry WAS physically abused. It's a children's book, so she doesn't say it outright, but it's heavily implied. The Dursleys were not 'mean', they were child abusers. We shouldn't blur the lines on that.
