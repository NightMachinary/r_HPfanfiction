I have two favorite crossovers. One of them, Shadow of Angmar, has already been discussed.

Instead, let's discuss linkffn(Cursebreaking Hamunaptra by Zenzao). This is a Harry Potter/The Mummy (1999) fusion starring a post-divorce Bill Weasley. This hasn't been updated in three years, two months and three days. There are four chapters, and FFN lists it as being 8,441 words. When you put this all together, you'd think "oh, died about because it had nothing going on." That would be an incorrect assumption. This is a well-written story, which does more with 8,441 words (approximately 588 of which aren't actually story but essentially author's notes) than stories with over 200k words. Each word feels deliberately placed, backstory and exposition are beautifully woven in. The fusion is handled with more grace than I would ever expect for a Harry Potter and adventure movie that didn't age super well. The magic is outstanding. I can't say enough good things about this fic. It's less than 10k, you have no excuse not to give it at least one read.
