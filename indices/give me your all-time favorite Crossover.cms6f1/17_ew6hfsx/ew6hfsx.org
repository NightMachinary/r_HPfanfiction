Harry Potter and the Natural 20 has already been recced, I see....

I like The Room With A Computer, which is a crossover with the X-Men movieverse and has Cyclops as the Muggle Studies teacher. It's a pretty low-key fic, not too much happening... but totally worth it for the character interactions, AND for the epilogue where Arthur Weasley gets a ride in the X-Jet and is just as ecstatic about it as you'd expect. linkffn(13243910)

Also have a soft spot for the Son of the Archer series, a crossover with the MCU where Ron is kidnapped by Death Eaters as a baby, and then rescued by Clint "Hawkeye" Barton, who ends up adopting him. I really like that someone OTHER than Harry got the "raised by crossover character" treatment here... and Tony Stark gets some really funny dialogue, especially in the third story. linkffn(11230962; 11884262; 12796500)

Never got into the Shadow of Angmar, and my fave LOTR crossover, Not Quite A Maia, seems to have been purged from the internet... but I did enjoy Back to the Beginning. It's Fem!Harry... SORT of. Harry's the reincarnation of Nurundil, the companion of Namo, and after having lived out his canon life finds himself in Middle-Earth shortly before of the War of the Ring, in the very female body of Nurundil but with the memories of Harry. linkffn(10131514)
