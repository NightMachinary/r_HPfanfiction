Linkffn(10784770) by far the best Mass Effect crossover out there imo.

Linkffn(8551180) Part 1 of a trilogy. Not a crossover itself, but it sets the scene for part two which goes into Stargate and part three which goes into Mass Effect.

Linkffn(4753440) Actually the same situation as above, not a crossover itself, but part two goes into Star Trek:NG while part 3 goes into Star Wars.

Linkffn(11157943) Star Wars crossover, sadly seems to be abandoned.

Linkffn(11577249) Star Wars crossover, also one of my all time favorites. Its great.

Linkffn(9586702) is always great, but it is fuckin long at 1m words, and has a sequel in progress.

Thought about adding "Browncoat, Green Eyes" to this, but you surely know about that masterpiece.
