I thought Scryer only works on FFN? Well, that's great!

Most of the popular and good fanfiction in FFN or AO3 is already on my bookmark, favourite, or the one I don't like. I'm just curious since I really have no fanfic recommendation from HPFF at all. I mean, from ~84k story, at least 840 of them are good, right?

Edit:

I have no idea if I'm dumb or the option to search from HPFF.com just isn't there. Can you tell me how?
