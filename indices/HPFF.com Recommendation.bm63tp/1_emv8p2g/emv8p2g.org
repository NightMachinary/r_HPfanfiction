This is copied directly from a post over on [[/r/HPRomione][r/HPRomione]] but I had a mental break down almost a year ago to this date when I thought I lost these fics forever.

All written by the fabulous [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=77390][sand_dollar]], the first story was published in 2006, prior to Deathly Hallows coming out. There are four stories in total, two being sequels to the others. They are all long (200,000+) stories that feature a Ron and Hermione who are undoubtedly in love (and profess their love for each other often) and fully in character. All four stories have a strong Harry/Ron/Hermione friendship, engaging plots, and characters written to cannon, flaws and all.

​

[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=191950][After the Summer Ended]] was the first story and published pre-Deathly Hallows. The story centers around Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they Horcrux Hunt. Ron and Hermione get together really early in this fic and while romance it is not the primary plot, their relationship is a crucial part of the story. For a story written before Deathly Hallows was published, I am amazed at how accurate the author's predictions are. Honestly, it's the Deathly Hallows I always wanted because it featured my favorite ship +rather than so many pages on wand lore+. Spoilerin this story Ron and Hermione get married super fast which is 100% my headcanon and what I wanted in DH anyway

​

[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=207276][Winter of the Dark Witch]] is the sequel to After the Summer Ended and features the gang all grown up with AU!children heading off to Hogwarts. Ron and Hermione running a pub all the while getting up to the same shenanigans with Auror Potter. Ron and Hermione's son is a major character to this story and he is written like a proper child while adding value to the plot. This story only makes sense if you've read After the Summer Ended and is the most cannon deviant, but an absolute delight.

​

[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=230148][The Onset of Autumn]] takes place after the Battle of Hogwarts and the year following as Harry, Ron, and Hermione start jobs at the Ministry. Admittedly this is my least favorite of all of the stories. I love all of the Ron/Hermione parts, but the plot feels secondary to the relationship development and honestly, the main plot gets downright confusing at times. There's also time travel which I think is my, personal biggest gripe and caused some timeline issues making the story longer than it strictly needed to be. It does have a proper, well written, in character Draco redemption arc (if you're into that kind of thing).

​

[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=261260][If Spring Ever Comes]] is by far *my favorite piece of fan fiction of all time*. If you read nothing else, then take the time to read this one. In this story, Ron has to go away on a secret undercover mission and of course, Hermione figures it all out. It features an overprotective Ron (and Hermione) who miss each other desperately. Bonus, the Weasley family keeps trying to get them back together (with almost no one thinking they're broken up).

It is a sequel to The Onset of Autumn but it's not strictly necessary to read Autumn first understand the plot. The essential points would be that Ron/Hermione got married less than six months after the battle, Draco had a girlfriend who died and therefore became his motivation to assist Harry, and Hermione worked at the ministry for a year before finishing her NEWTS.

​

Aside from Winter of the Dark Witch, every story can all be read independently. When I read Deathly Hallows I was legitimately mad that Ron and Hermione didn't have the love story they deserved and take these as an acceptable substitute. I've probably read After the Summer Ended and If Spring Ever Comes half a dozen or more times through the years. Looking at them critically these stories have greatly formed my personal head-cannons and beliefs about Ron and Hermione's relationship.
