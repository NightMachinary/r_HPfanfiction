Thanks to your post, I managed to find some fics that I wrote when I was 11 (I hadn't looked at HPFF since the site got reuploaded). A while back, I posted in a thread, something to the tune of "What's the worst fanfiction you've ever read?" and I listed off some "plot points" that I had in my story. It was requested that I share the fanfiction, but I couldn't upload it anywhere else due to it being written in a script format.

If I come across any actual good fics, I'll let you know. :)
