Every story by cywscross should be considered abandoned from the first chapter. The author is constitutionally unable to finish stories, content to start story after story, then leaving them for the next shiny. It's bad enough that I won't even start any new stories by the author (who, coincidentally, just posted four new chapters of a new Bleach fic last night).

Perhaps you might try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7165521/1/Don-t-Disrespect-the-Queen][Don't Disrespect the Queen]] by Perspicacity? Harry's mentored by Connor MacLeod (crossover with the first Highlander film).

Edit: editorializing on cywscross.
