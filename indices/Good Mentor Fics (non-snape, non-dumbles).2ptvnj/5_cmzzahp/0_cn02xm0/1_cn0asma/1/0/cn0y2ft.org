I don't need to read past the summary (most of the time) to know I won't like an Indy!Harry Evil!Manipualtive!Dumbledore Weasley!bashing or a Powerful!Dark!harry Fic but sometimes is good to ask someone it's opinion because some writters are terrible at writing sumaries but quite decent at actual story telling

For example I would never read The Denarian Renegade if not for a recomendation from someone here in this subreddit because from the outset sounds like your average powerfull harry even through it's actually quite good.

Yet I don't have the time to read every fic out there to find if it's actually decent or worth the read.
