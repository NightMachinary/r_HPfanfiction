It's certainly Indy!harry, but it's not completely derivative like so many are.

For one, it begins during Harry's 4th school year, so there's no "I killed Sirius!" angst, no shopping trip (no super!wand, no super!trunk, etc), no weepy letter from Harry's parents found in the vault that the good!super!Goblins led him to, no weepy message from Sirius in his will, and no showing off Harry's collections of fancy titles and Head of House rings.

It also portrays a manipulative!Dumbledore who is actually marginally competent, which means Harry can't just deliver [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam][inane melodramatic speeches]] to defeat him. And the fic actually portrays the horror of mind magic realistically.

BUT, it is indy!Harry, so maybe that's just not your thing. Also, the prose can get way too purple for my taste. And it's on hiatus :(
