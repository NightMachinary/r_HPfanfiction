This was the one I was thinking of, thank you.

It's been a while since I read this, but if I recall correctly the fic was very original (to me anyway), very well written, and had plausible premises or at least the author made attempts to fill plot holes without resorting to miracles.

It's hard to recommend things to readers without knowing their tastes, but I would feel reasonably confident recommending this to anyone in this subreddit.
