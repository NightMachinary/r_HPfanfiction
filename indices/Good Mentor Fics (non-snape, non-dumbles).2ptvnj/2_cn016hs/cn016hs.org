Harry won at the Battle of Hogwarts, but corruption still controlled the Ministry. With the help of his 'friends', they send him to Azkaban. Haunted with his worst memories by the Dementors, Harry starts to plot his escape and his revenge on the world. His first plan? To free and enlist the help of Grindelwald. Dark!Harry; HP/GD. SLOW UPDATES UNTIL COMPLETION OF THE SOUL WITHIN!

Only posting this because you said you wanted Grindelwald or Regulus. In my opinion, Grindelwald isn't nearly as much as a mentor in this story as Regulus was in Dead Man Walking, but he still has the role.
