Neither have I. There's very few stories where he's really well written. Oh God Not Again, also by Sarah (she likes the guy for some reason), is the best off the top of my head though I recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6849022/1/An-Old-and-New-World][Old and New World]] by Lens of Sanity, and it has a much smarter Lockhart than canon, and also includes a plot element I've been looking for since 2010/1 and nobody bloody told me already existed, which if you've been around here long enough you've seen me whine about a whole bunch but I don't want to spoil it for you in case you haven't.
