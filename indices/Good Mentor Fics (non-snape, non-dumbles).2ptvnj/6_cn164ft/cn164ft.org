I suppose [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][this]] and to a far lesser extent [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][this]] applies, as mentor Voldemort fics of sorts.

The first, PotDK, is the one you'll have heard about as having the best Voldemort in town, and is a long-spanning AU set in a world where Voldemort won, and ends up mentoring Harry to be his "prince". Great example of worldbuilding, but it must be said that it is a very long and sprawling fic, (a million words and in the sixth year) and features some rare examples of mythology and paganism (done well).

What Lies Beneath is very much the opposite, being a tightly plotted and compact fic, which basically has Riddle influencing Harry after the events of second year. More recommending because I finished it today and have it on the brain than applicability, tbh, but a very high-quality read.

Neither are slash, ftr.
