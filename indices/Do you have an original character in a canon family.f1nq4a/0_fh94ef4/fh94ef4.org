I have a handful, mostly in the background. I've always kept a list of interesting names and a while back I began a wizarding name sub-list, so I tend to refer to that first. If names in that family follow a pattern, I will try to follow it. If the appearance of any canon members are known, I overlap their appearances a little. Most are a product of the way they were raised, no dramatic deviations so far. I'm sure it'll happen eventually.
