Alright, this is shameless self promotion and only narrowly fits into the story type you requested. I wrote this a while ago and I think it hints enough at Harry/Hermione to qualify.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10946431/1/The-Elder-Wand-s-Call]] (edited after link) They can't all have happy endings. And can't all explore the relationship completely. I enjoyed writing this and hope some people enjoy reading it. Sorry, if it is too far off topic.
