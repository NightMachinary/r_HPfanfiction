Personally I find the opposite to be the case.

The books are like a cleansing wind that reminds me why I like HP in the first place, and all the Flanderization of Ron and Hermione, sympathetic portrayals of Snape/Draco/Voldemort, helpful goblins, trust vaults, jogging and training, and point-and-shoot magic just blows away like the annoying dirt that it is.
