- While everyone thinks that Grandma Evans used to be a bobby, she actually held (holds?) a high position in the MI6.
- +She hates her first name, Marigold, so her close colleagues started calling her M. It caught on quickly and soon all of MI6 was calling her M. On a completely different note, people sometimes tell her that she looks like Judi Dench.+
- Nobody knew Grandma Evans was still alive, because Petunia lied to Lily, after their parents were attacked by Death Eaters. She felt, that both her mother and her sister were responsible for her beloved father's death. Her sister for her involvement in the magical war and her mother for her work with MI6. Breaking contact between them felt like fitting punishment to her.
- Grandma Evans knew about the war and that her daughter and son in law were in hiding and Petunia had been estranged for a while, so she didn't question that neither of daughters visited her in hospital after the attack. After her husband's death she threw herself into her work and only shortly resurfaced, when Voldemort fell.
- Her contacts informed her that only her little grandson survived and when a letter from Petunia reached her to tell her that she and her husband would be raising the boy and to stay the fuck away from them, she believed Harry to be in good hands.
- That changed when a report of the Ministry Six and the fight in the department of mysteries landed on her desk.
- (The Triwizard Tournament Incident and Voldemort's Resurrection had been covered up surprisingly well. She only heard of her grandson's competing after he had already won and chalked it up to an early onset case of Evans Badassery. Later that night, she had a whiskey in her grandson's honor and allowed herself a moment of pride for the boy she had never met.)
- Her plans of discretely contacting Harry upon his majority to invite him to tea, should he wish to meet her, went out the window immediately.
- She spend the whole ride to Surrey in a state of ice cold rage. She had respected her daughter's wishes for almost two decades and she would happily go back to doing so, but first she needed answers.
- The 'visit' lasted only about half an hour. She didn't need to listen to Petunia long to figure out that her teenage jealousy had festered into fanatic hatred of anything she deemed not normal. She could not bring herself to speculate how her grandson had suffered in their 'care'. How could she have been so naive, to think her daughter could love the boys, when she had hated his mother? It didn't matter now. Neither her nor Harry would ever step foot into that house again, not while see was alive. She had handed her other grandson her contact info, though.
- Driving back to London, she called her old friend and Head of Magical Law Enforcement, Amelia Bones, to call in a favour.
- One does not fuck with an Evans. Voldemort tried with her daughter and he spend 13 years as a spirit, parasite and creature. Countless of her personal enemies and enemies of England had tried and all had sooner or later met an unpleasant end, while she prevailed.
- One does not fuck with an Evans. The wizarding world would remember that for generations, after she was done with them.
