An interesting idea but I was thinking of Granny Evans giving it to Dobby as a gift. And dobby using the walking stick as a drum major staff for the House elf marching band. ( This fic May end up with a sub plot about Dobby founding a marching band to provide Granny Evans with an epic theme song. )
