Not completely related to this, but I have always despaired how little we know about previous generations in the wizarding world. Aside from Neville's gran, for example, we don't know about any grandparent. How many of you know your grandparents? Given the prolonged life for wizards and witches, isn't it strange?

Therefore, I like linkffn(7211094), because it deals extensively with whole Evans family. Although, it tends to go to some very weird places later, so I am not sure whether I have finished to read it (and it is incomplete even after 39 chapters).
