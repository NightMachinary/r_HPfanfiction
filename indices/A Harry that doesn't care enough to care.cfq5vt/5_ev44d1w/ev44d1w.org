Linkffn(In the Mind of a Scientist by ZenoNoKyuubi) might have a bit of what you want.

When the triwizard tournament comes around he outright rejects the idea that he has to compete, despite what everyone says, because he's confident that someone entering him won't result in the normal consequences. Then Dumbledore asks him to participate, and he shrugs and agrees.

And yeah he's just that fucking good, no pretending required.
