I don't think magic has a solution for everything, or sometimes that solution has faults of its own. For instance, maybe there is a warming charm, but it only works when the moon is waxing gibbous. Otherwise it is uncomfortably warm or ineffective, depending on the lunar cycle. Maybe there's a potion that cures baldness, but from 1-2 PM the drinker can only sing opera when trying to speak.

It makes more sense to me that there isn't a simple solution for everything.

Edit: Whoops, I didn't even answer your request! I don't really know of anything like that. There's a user here who was asking for ideas to write about things like this, so I'll try to dig it up.

Edit 2: In [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3orv1i/discussion_which_stories_would_you_want_to_see_in/][this topic]] by [[/u/capitolprostitute]], they mention that they're looking for ideas. Perhaps you can interest them with some ideas?
