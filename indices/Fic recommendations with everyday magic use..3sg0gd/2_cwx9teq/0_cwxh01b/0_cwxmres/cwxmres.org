Well, everything has its drawbacks. I think that should be applied to magic as well. It costs money to heat your house and gosh darn it still is cold by the Windows. Magical fixes should have drawbacks as well. Maybe the Home Heating Charm has to be renewed every year and is too complicated for the average witch or wizard-they have to hire someone. I don't think every issue should have a simple spell that solves it. I guess I think it's more interesting than perfect spells for every problem.
