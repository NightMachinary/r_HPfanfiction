That's how it works in Patron - spell casting and maintenance is what most wizards and witches work at, specializing in a few complicated spells most can't cast themselves. Usually convenience spells too. But the spells themselves don't have disadvantages. You don't run the risk of a fire when using heating charms, nor are warming charms unreliable.
