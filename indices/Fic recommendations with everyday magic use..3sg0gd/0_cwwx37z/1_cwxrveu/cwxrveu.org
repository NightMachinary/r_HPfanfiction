Read a fic recently where Harry talked about buying a razor and said there was no charm to get a clean shave without feeling like your face was being cauterized. I absolutely loved that. Fanon has made HP a world where you can wave your wand and get any damn thing you please and it was nice to see something so simple that wasn't just easy.
