Technically, Warming Charms are fanon --- broadly used and benign, in my opinion, fanon, but fanon. There is a hot-air Charm that Hermione and Dumbledore use to dry out soggy clothes, but nothing ongoing.

Now that I think about it, that makes for an interesting worldbuilding element... Yes, there is a lot of demand for a spell that does that, but no one's been able to produce one with a right combination of temperature (effective, but not scalding, even if not cast absolutely perfectly) and area of effect (because you don't want to walk by an icebox and melt everything inside; nor do you want to heat one half of your internal organs but not the other half), while being simple enough that it doesn't take a Dumbledore to cast it.

That aside...

linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) has a magical society that is profoundly affected by magic, including some very charming worldbuilding touches that are obvious in retrospect.
