So the very first chapter of Amalgum-Lockhart's Folly has Ron bashing (in front of the entire Great Hall, no less), because apparently Harry!Lockhart decides that clearly Ron is the reason young Harry was shit at fighting Voldemort. Definitely not off to a great start.

When in Doubt, Obliviate is pretty good though.
