It's not unintelligible without prior knowledge of Fate, but some things are skimmed over. Use the wiki as an aid if you are confused. If you care about spoilers for Fate then I wouldn't recommend it as it heavily spoils Fate Stay Night and Fate Zero and mildly spoils a fair number of other works... Not sure I would recommend it to someone without prior knowledge of Fate, but I did enjoy it quite a bit myself.

It's an OP Harry btw.
