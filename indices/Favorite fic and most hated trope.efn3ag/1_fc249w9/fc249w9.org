My 2 favorite stories are Prince of the Dark Kingdom(s/3766574) and Unatoned(s/8262940). IMO they are at the top of their respective genres.

Prince of the Dark Kingdom is more standard type of a fanfiction, the writing can use work and it's unfortunately unfinished, but as far as plot and characters are concerned, it definately won't disappoint. On the other hand, Unatoned is written really well, but it's not for everybody.

The trope I hate the most is the "Harry inherited this and that, so now he's the coolest, the strongest, etc.". The moment I read the words Lord Potter/Black/Peverell I just skip it. On top of being the laziest plot device, it seems people have started a contest about who can write it in the most unoriginal way.
