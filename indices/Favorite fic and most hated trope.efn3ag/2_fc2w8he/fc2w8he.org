I can't pick a single favorite Of All Time fic, though I ‘do' have an ever growing list of fics that've held the title at one time or another (on ffn). It's not only HP, but that does account for about half of the list.

Feel free to browse it, to your hearts content. Though it's My favorite kind of fic's, so it may not be to your liking. Link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Those-Less-Forgotten/124884/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/]]

As for most hated trope... I'm not a fan of Slash, and I despise Draco/Hermione or Snape/Hermione. Though I ‘have' found a Slash fic I can read. It's on the list above; Again and Again.
