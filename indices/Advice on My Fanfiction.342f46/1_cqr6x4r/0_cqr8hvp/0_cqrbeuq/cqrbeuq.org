Thanks. If I can explain my opinions on writing to someone it helps sort it out in my own head. What I'm trying to say is, I'm glad to give my thoughts on this.

Here's my take:

1. If anything, longer chapters would make it harder for the readers, in my opinion. But regardless of length, six or seven chapters is what, 7k words at this rate based on the post-prologue first chapter? A little too long for things to build. That would be like not getting to magic /at all/ (counting your prologue) until after the Hagred minecart scene. Few strong, directly plot-advancing scenes for that long isn't a good idea. As for chapter length, if someone wants to read about an interesting Snape or the AU background, they'll be interested in chapters of almost any length (though I'd stay below 10k). If they aren't just in it for Snape, etc., a reader waiting to get to what they think is the "good stuff" could be an issue. That's why I suggest front-loading something both strong and important to your story so you don't lose readers' attention before then.

2. You've already given away some of that in the summary. But those parts are really cool, right? The actual moments where those things happen? That's why people will want to read them. Beacuse they're cool. Don't make them wait unnecessicarily. Sure, don't give away the moments that need to build, the twists and surprises. But the obvious stuff can be presented without explaining everything ahead of time. Don't climax too early (aha), but do tease some things. Balance it out by having those surprises people don't see coming happen early and often.
