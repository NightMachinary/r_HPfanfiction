I don't think you're being harsh at all. This is the most helpful advice I've received. Thanks for taking the time.

A couple follow up questions.

1. How much of what you said above do you think could have been avoided by longer chapters? The thing is, in my opinion, I think a lot of the later chapters do build tension and have promises, but I wanted these six or seven chapters to set the stage. And instead if I made it one huge chapter, then we'd get tension by chapter two instead of chapter ten.

2. Re non-linear - I've thought about this myself, but I can't seem to do this without spoiling the way certain promises resolve. A big one was going to be Harry's first dark magic, Harry's first unforgivable, Harry's first kill, etc. And I feel like if I started there, and worked backwards, then it's the hindsight effect and people just say 'oh, well of course the story is going there.' Do you agree? If so, how do you strike a balance?
