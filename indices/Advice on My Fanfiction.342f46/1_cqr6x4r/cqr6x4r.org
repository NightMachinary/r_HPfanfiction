Format wise, I'd suggest adding more tags to AO3 and a different picture to FFN.

From a content standpoint, I think it is starting too slow. Information in these first two chapters is clearly important to the story, but not so much to the reader. At least, not yet.

The prologue doesn't really grip so much as paint a picture. The next chapter only presents more answers, not questions. And that's not really enough. Very little tension is being built. The summary tells us where this is going (which is fine) but we're being walked instead of run towards that interesting AU conclusion to Snape's life.

I suggest you make a change to your first few chapters. Pick something big from slightly later in the story to start things off. Grab the reader with something shocking and new, something they haven't seen before. Make a promise for what's to come, then go back for details. Not too many, though. Not in a row.

Instead of starting with background, begin the story with something big and important. A wedding or a funeral. A fist fight or a lover's clench. A birth or a murder.

Harry uses Dark magic for the first time. Snape's funeral. Dumbledore kills someone. A Lily who is mature, lonely, and a mother invites a lover to her bed. A Dumbledore who is full of life and magic invites a lover to his bed. Lily kills someone. Voldemort returns, but not the way people expect. Something to divide and polarize, to entice and enchant.

Put that non-linear bit or focus element first, then put your prologue behind that. Then repeat for chapter two, starting with something later or Harry-centric, then going back for the details and history of the situation.

I get that this is the AU changes being presented, but I don't feel that's enough. I have overdone this non-linear format style, but people who have read my stories usually remember them, for better or worse. I think it works very well for fanfiction, as people usually know what to expect and will be bored by retellings of the same old setting and events, even if there are new elements being added.

I've been told I'm harsh, so I want to make clear the pictures being painted are good ones. That's why I want more tension. I like a lot of what I see.
