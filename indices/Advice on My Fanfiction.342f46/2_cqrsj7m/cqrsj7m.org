First, your writing is very digestible. Easy to read and follow along. Since its revealed in your summary that Snape dies, I would shorten the prologue to cover the entirety of his life and death. Seven chapters is too long to linger on a known character death despite the character being well written.

Then, you can time jump to the present. I think it would serve better to create a frantic prologue. Leave the beginning of the prologue as is. Condense the area where he asks for Dumbledore's help. I would leave out the parts with Regulus and Rosier as well. End the prologue with his death.

I'm interested to see what you can create going forward. Traveling the already worn path and describing the past is easy. Creating the future will be hard.
