It was far from boring. On the contrary, it was engaging despite knowing his death would be coming soon.

It would just have more impact if the Snape portion was condensed to a prologue. Plus, if you wanted to keep it to true GRRM style - killing off a character in the prologue is the way to go. I'd also leave off Harry becoming dark in the A/N.
