That is exactly what that would be. The idea that wizards win, because magic is automatically better than superior numbers, tactics, and technology is wizard wank. If you could just apparate in and imperius the government heads, Grindelwald would have won WWII for Hitler, before wizards got involved to stop him. Apperating into buildings is difficult. Casting the imperius is difficult. Heads of state do not congregate in a single area, and often require permission from a separate governing body to do anything useful.
