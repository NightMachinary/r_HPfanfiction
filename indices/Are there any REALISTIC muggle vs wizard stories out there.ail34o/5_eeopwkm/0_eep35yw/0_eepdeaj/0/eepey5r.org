The West does. China has nowhere near as much terrorism as we do because they are an oppressive regime which ignores human rights. A Muslim blew himself up? Better deport a few million of them to "reeducation" camps. Is it humane? No. Should we do it? No. Does it work? Well, better than our blunders. Although I maintain the position that Syria would have been resolved 5 years ago if NATO had not supplied terrorists with weapons and money to fight an ally of Russia.
