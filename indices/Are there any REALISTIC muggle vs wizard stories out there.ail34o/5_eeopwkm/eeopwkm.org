I don't think I've ever read a fic that pitted the two factions against each other extensively. I've read plenty of fics where the idea is discussed and where the magical faction is uneducated on the weapons muggles have at their disposal (especially when it comes to nuclear weapons) and the sheer number of muggles in the world. But I don't recall there ever being a true clash.
