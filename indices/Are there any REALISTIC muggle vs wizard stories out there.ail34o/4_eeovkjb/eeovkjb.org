Marquis Black comes to mind. Emperor is his best and most well known story, although I'll point out that he changes the HP magic system into a mix of anime tropes. Magic in his stories is nerfed to basically being "any sufficiently advanced technology" and reduced to a numbers game: if the tank has more dps than the wizard's shield regen speed, the tank wins.
