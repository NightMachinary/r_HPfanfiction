The only thing I have even vaguely close is the first half of chapter 3 of Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11913447/3/Amalgum-Lockhart-s-Folly]]). It is a Time travel fic and chapter 3 describes the future that harry comes back from, a world where voldemort's muggle hunts enrage the muggle world to strike back at the wizarding world. Is kinda a curbstomp though. How realistic it is, is up for debate.
