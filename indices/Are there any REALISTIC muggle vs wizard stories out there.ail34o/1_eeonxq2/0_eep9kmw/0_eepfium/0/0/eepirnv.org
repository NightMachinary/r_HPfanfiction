  Bullets? Shield Charm
#+end_quote

Shield charms are directional. Which means that you can, maybe, shield from direct fire. But that shield will do you no good when a few dozen six-inch shells rain down all around you. And overpressure would be another lethal issue against which shield charms are ineffective.

Also, the point of suppressive fire is not to kill the other side but to keep them where they are and prevent advances. Keep them pinned and blast them with explosives.

  Well, ignoring the fact that we don't use chemical warfare

Even tear gas would do the trick. Something regularly used for crowd control despite its useage during the first world war. Force them to cast bubblehead charms, which ought to come with some kind of side effect (blurry vision, divided attention). If the charm fails, they are exposed and almost guaranteed to be neutralised.

  It's an unrealistic premise anyway. There has to be a reason muggles would decide to kill thousands/tens of thousands of people, including children. The only way they would be willing to do this would be if the wizards struck first,

An all-out war yes. But Muggles vs Voldemort could work reasonably well. Ask the Muggleborns where the magical manors are and just shell/bomb those "holes" on the map into oblivion. You are firing on coordinates, not on sight, so the "anti-muggle" measures are useless. And given that shells are inanimate objects, wards should not be triggered by them (unless you have some against meteoroid strikes).

It would not be impossible to coordinate a syncronised attack at a given time if you can prepare it.
