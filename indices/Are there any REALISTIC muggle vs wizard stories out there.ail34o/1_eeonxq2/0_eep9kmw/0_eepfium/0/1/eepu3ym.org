  And it's still crazy to me to suggest they could wipe out all wizards even in Britain, especially in one strike/day/whatever.

A "curbstomping" doesn't have to be a perfect genocide. Just an overwhelming victory. Like, say, what the Japanese did to Singapore.

Or if you want to write a really nasty story do it like the second Iraq war, in which the "curbstomping" was done with insufficient planning and knowledge, the puppet government installed was inept, there was a massive and effective insurgency, and it didn't end well for anyone except for a few contractors who made vast amounts of money from corrupt contracts.
