Isn't that scene a perfect example of their overconfidence?

The Wizards never appear professional or organized enough to keep this secret from high level, well funded espionage, no matter how much they yell "but but statute of secrecy". There are way too many people in the known. The only way it's staying a secret in public is because the Muggle agencies are supporting this idea. Do you really think the CIA or the KGB are going to be surprised about the Wizards in any way? At the very least they know everything we know from reading the HP books.

  Why do you people arguing for the might of the muggles always assume that wizards would be totally caught off guard by something like guns and missiles?

Because they are totally caught off guard even by weapons from their own world like Polyjuice and the Imperius? Even Dumbledore, who's supposedly one of their smartest, is unable to establish any kind of operational security. They are confused by Muggle attire and any modern technology. They are completely inept and if they believe they have some kind of edge they are most likely mistaken.
