Overconfidence that comes from being on top, sure.

  There are way too many people in the known.

And? If someone came to you and told you magic existed and there was a whole secret society of wizards, you'd call them crazy. Even if a group did it, you'd brush it off as some lame prank, no matter how much they insisted.

And even if they managed to convince some high-ranking official, then what? You forget that one side has magic on their side. If you want to talk about too many people being in the known, then why wouldn't wizards get wind of some secret muggle military group preparing and watching them? And then go and, you know, fix that?

  Do you really think the CIA or the KGB are going to be surprised about the Wizards in any way?
#+end_quote

Why not? They're not perfect. They're still human beings, the CIA and KGB and whoever. You don't think they fuck up in the real world? How do you know there aren't wizards keeping an eye on them?

#+begin_quote
  Because they are totally caught off guard even by weapons from their own world like Polyjuice and the Imperius?
#+end_quote

Yeah, because your average person isn't going to expect to come across those things on your average day. Are you telling me you're not going to be caught off guard if you walk into your house and there's a man with a fucking gun waiting for you?

Even CIA/FBI/whoever agents are going to be caught off guard. These people don't live every day as though they might be murdered. Not even Dumbledore does. Why would they? Keep in mind that these books take place over /seven years/. For all the fun drama we see, there's a whoooole lot of boring in there.

You don't think our own governments get caught off guard, have terrible security at times, or are full of stupidity?

  They are confused by Muggle attire and any modern technology. They are completely inept and if they believe they have some kind of edge they are most likely mistaken.

No, some wizards are. And some wizards aren't. Kingsley Shacklebolt is good enough that not even the Prime Minister suspects anything, and is utterly shocked when he finds out he's a wizard. You're generalizing all wizards because of a few stupid ones we see.

The majority of wizards are half-bloods (Ch 7, Chamber of Secrets), meaning they have some connection to muggles. There's also muggle-borns, of course. To suggest wizards in general are confused about muggles and "completely inept" is stupid and unreasonable.
