You might as well say that you don't get a victory against France until you wipe out all the French. All it takes is one decent Frenchman to ruin everything. One single Frenchman who can stab you with a fork.

Victory is when they offer surrender, you tell them your terms, and they (perhaps grudgingly) accept. Whether the victory /lasts/ is of course more complicated. As indeed has been the case every time anyone was victorious over the French.
