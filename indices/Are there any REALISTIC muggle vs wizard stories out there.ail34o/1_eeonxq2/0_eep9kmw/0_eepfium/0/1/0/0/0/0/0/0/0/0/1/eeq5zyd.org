Yeah, there is no way the Eastern Block didn't figure out what was happening. Almost every country there had internal intelligence agencies "whose power would have made the Gestapo envious" (Tom Clancy).

Oh, those 11-year-old children keep disappearing? And the fiftieth parent we tortured said there is a magic society hidden right under our noses? Get the phone Ivan, we have to tell the chairman.

Then the children are threatened into acquiring all books they can get their hands on ("do it or we kill your parents") and the secret is revealed, at least to the KGB and Party Leadership. Consequently, the FSB and Russian head of state would know, as would the Germans who dug through the Stasi archives (I don't know how the other countries handled their surveillance agencies, but some ought to have figured it out). Since Germany knows, so does NATO.

And Mao probably purged the entire magical population of China during the "Great Leap Forwards".
