People like Vernon and Dudley Dursley know about the Wizarding World and you want to maintain the position that it is possible that the KGB, CIA or any other decently funded intelligence agency could not know about it. The Saudis would probably have had a number of muggles related to Wizards in some torture chambers. "Oh jeez, I wonder where all these children disappear to at the age of 11... what a mystery."

I think we disagree so fundamentally on the nature of reality that any further discussion is pointless.
