You don't get a victory against wizards until you wipe them all out. All it takes is one decent wizard to ruin everything. One single wizard who can Apparate, cast the Imperius, Disillusionment Charm, etc. So you would have to kill them all to make sure there aren't any.

Not just Britain, but worldwide, because one is bound to seek revenge otherwise. Even if you wipe out all wizards but one, they alone could destroy the entire cities/worlds with fiendfyre, nukes, or even dropping a big ass rock from high up.
