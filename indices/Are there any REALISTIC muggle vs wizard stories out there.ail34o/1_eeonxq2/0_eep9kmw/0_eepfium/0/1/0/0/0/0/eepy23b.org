Why do you people arguing for the might of the Wizards always assume that Muggles would be totally caught off guard by something like the imperius? Everything that's in basic Hogwarts textbooks and common knowledge to Muggleborn will be known to the Muggle military.

Basic operational security would protect against the worst of it and if they specifically prepare tactics against it it will not be all that useful. I would be reallly fucking surprised if major Muggle nations don't have a prepared plan of engagement in case of war with the Wizards.
