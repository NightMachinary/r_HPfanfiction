  If you go for a global conflict, yes. A British one would be easier. And given how little the other nations do about Voldemort, it does not have to escalate further.

I seriously doubt the rest of the wizarding world would just stand by while an entire country of theirs gets wiped out. And it's still crazy to me to suggest they could wipe out all wizards even in Britain, especially in one strike/day/whatever.

First you need to somehow find all the wizards and where they live, then bypass any magical protections, then you have to launch a coordinated strike that wipes them all off the map, somehow managing to make sure none see it coming or Apparate away, and all assuming that magical protections wouldn't stop the attacks.

It's an unrealistic premise anyway. There has to be a reason muggles would decide to kill thousands/tens of thousands of people, including children. The only way they would be willing to do this would be if the wizards struck first, delivering an incredibly cruel and significant blow. And in that case, wizards are already on the attack and it's game over for the muggles anyway.

  They literally mount a Napoleonic Charge on Hogwarts (and succeed for some reason).

As Fudge says, the other side had magic.

  Give a bunch of machine guns, artillery pieces, gas shells and mortars to the defenders (as well as people who can operate them), wait until the Death Eaters are deep within the anti-apparation wards and they are wiped out in a minute. It would be similar to the French during the Battle of the Frontiers (1914).

Except, you know, the French didn't have magic on their side.

This is all assuming wizards can't protect themselves against muggle weaponry, which I don't buy. We know the Shield Charm can protect against physical objects, so why not bullets? HP magic isn't Skyrim or DnD magic, where there's mana to deplete and it only takes a certain amount of mundane force to break through.

Bullets? Shield Charm. Gas shells? Well, ignoring the fact that we don't use chemical warfare (this is where war conventions would be relevant), there's still things like the Bubble-Head Charm, or something similar, or Apparition (why/how would anti-Apparition jinxes be used against the wizards?), or again the Shield Charm. Or so many other kinds of magic.

And that's ignoring the fact that wizards have anti-muggle magic that would stop an assault in the first place. So not only would muggles have to first find these magical bases protected by enchantments, but then they'd have to get past them. And suggesting they would be able to do it with ease is 100% speculation and not supported by anything in canon.
