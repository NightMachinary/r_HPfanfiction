If you go for a global conflict, yes. A British one would be easier. And given how little the other nations do about Voldemort, it does not have to escalate further. I also don't see the Muggleborn fighting on the same side as Malfoy or Lestrange, so it would not be a pure Muggle vs Wizard scenario.

They literally mount a Napoleonic Charge on Hogwarts (and succeed for some reason). Give a bunch of machine guns, artillery pieces, gas shells and mortars to the defenders (as well as people who can operate them), wait until the Death Eaters are deep within the anti-apparation wards and they are wiped out in a minute. It would be similar to the French during the Battle of the Frontiers (1914).
