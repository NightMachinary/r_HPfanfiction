Neither side is getting defeated with a first strike, no matter how successful or powerful it is. Not unless they literally destroy the Earth. Both live all around the world.

I also don't see wizards marching to battle like we do. They wouldn't have to show up to any battle, really. So long as one decent wizard exists, the war could be won for the wizards or at least neutralized.
