  There's nothing wrong with creating a friendly discussion based on the request.

Indeed - and anyone can /create/ a /discussion thread/ based on a request thread. But taking over a request thread to discuss, and usually diss, the OP's request? No, there's no need for that.

If you want to get directions for that famous bar and grill, you shouldn't be subjected to some "friendly discussion" about how alcohol and meat are the devil. Same for story request threads.
