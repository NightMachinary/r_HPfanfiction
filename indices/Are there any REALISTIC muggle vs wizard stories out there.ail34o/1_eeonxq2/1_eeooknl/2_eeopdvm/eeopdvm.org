I ask OP what they want after explaining why their request is not clear. That is compliant with R8.

Muggles would win if you wizards give a field battle or with a massive first strike. Wizards will win otherwise, just ask Starfox in any HP/GOT crossover discussion. So OP needs to elaborate on what they are looking for.
