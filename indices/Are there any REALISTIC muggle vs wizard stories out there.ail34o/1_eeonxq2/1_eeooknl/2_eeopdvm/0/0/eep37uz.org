Given that wizards would be absolutely wiped out on the battlefield but are able to neutralise the Muggle militaries within an hour, it is difficult to imagine a setting where you would have a proper war which would last for decades or centuries unless some Vietnam like Gurellia scenario where most wizards die and the remainder takes up arm against the Muggle world, who developed countermeasures to mind control and apparation.

It is not rare to see such a scenario, but it is usually chapter 1 of a time travel story where Harry goes back to the past to fix things because usually, it is somehow Voldemort's fault. The conflict is never really central and used for more to set the "everything is shit in the future" mood.
