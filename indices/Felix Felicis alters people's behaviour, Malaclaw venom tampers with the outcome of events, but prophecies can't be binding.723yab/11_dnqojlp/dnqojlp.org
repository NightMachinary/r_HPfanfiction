maybe prophecies are really just chronologically questionable accounts of events caused by felix felicis? They would come to pass but its always really open-ended? Enter Theodolphius Fortitude Fry, muggleborn potions master and terrible bowler. Theodolphius is tired of losing at Bowling Night, and brews a batch of Felix Felicis in order to win. Somehow, he still loses the game. He doesn't understand what happened until he reads the newspaper the next morning: the headline shouts: 'You-Know-Who defeated by Boy-Who-Lived.'

Or even better: 'Seers' just take swigs of Felix Felicis and start saying nonsense.
