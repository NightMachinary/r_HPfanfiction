I've always considered Felix Felicis a trans-temporal subconcious feedback loop taking advantage of the multiverse theory where it finds the decision branch out of all possible outcomes that the user's subconcious deems most successful or 'lucky' and then alters the behavior to follow that timeline. (think that weird fizzy soda from Methods of Rationality but a lot more complex) Malaclaw venom could probably do something similar but in reverse. The problem with that is that the venom is something that occurs naturally while felicis is a Potion and thus actually engineered? A particularly amusing theory is that the Venom can manipulate nonpersonal events via Chaos Theory (roll of dice, horse tripping on inconvenient rock, ect) and the Felix Felicis affects personal choices, and if both are ingested for the same period, a remarkable amount of... things occur, that would count as bad luck but also being really lucky about it (having a Dark Lord shoot you with an Avada Kedavra, but reflecting it, causing said Dark Lord to die instead?) which would sort of explain the eventfulness of all 7 years of Harry's schooling.
