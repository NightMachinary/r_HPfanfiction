I think it's just a case of prophesies being self-fulfilling...it doesn't have any power of its own, but if someone actually acts on the prophecy, it comes to pass. Adding to that, they are awfully vague(both of canon prophecies could apply to a large number of people), so i can kinda see what Dumbledore means about prophecies having no power
