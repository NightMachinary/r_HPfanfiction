Hmm...I wonder, what if prophecies were meant to be fate-binding, but the degree to which they did so depended on the 'strength' of their prophet?

So, like, a prophecy (or maybe a dictate) uttered by a dark lord who has lots of training and has bolstered their magic via dark rituals or such, might be a binding curse that outright twists reality and controls people to force it to come to pass. Like that spinning-wheel curse from Sleeping Beauty, or possibly the curse Voldemort placed on the DADA position (and there's another fate-twisting magic in Harry Potter, come to think of it).

While prophecies told by not-as-strong wizards/witches, might not have as much power, using one or two bursts of chance to try and engineer themselves into self-fulfilling prophecies. And prophecies by squibs, centaurs, giants or otherwise those with very little magic might have no binding power at all (Bane read Harry's defeat in the planets, which is part of why he was angry at Firenze. Possibly? I'm not sure.).

And of course, if someone's dead by the time their prophecy can potentially come to pass, their magic would most likely be unable to bind whoever they prophesize about, no matter how powerful they were when they were alive.

...Hang on, there's the beginnings of a plot in there.

When one of Salazar Slytherin's descendants married a Seer, Voldemort as a descendent of that line inherited the power to use the Third Eye; in addition, the dark rituals he's performed (and many sacrifices he's made) to augment himself have bolstered his magical muscle to the point that his prophecies are almost inescapably binding.

The curse on the DADA position at Hogwarts is proof of this; doing a 'test drive' of a ritual designed to create 'controlled' prophecies with a witness, Voldemort placed his malediction that no defence teacher at Hogwarts would stay for longer than a year.

Now, having used these style of binding prophecies a fair few times over the years to mark his enemies for death, Voldemort's planning a big one; a foretelling of the future where he reigns victorious and wields absolute power over all beings on Earth for eternity.

To make /this/ one happen, though, is going to need more than his own power and a bunch of Death Eaters as witnesses; to make this prophecy of doom binding needs Voldemort to gather several famous and legendary people to hear it first-hand, including his nemeses Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter, he needs just the right site to draw tremendous amounts of power from the earth's ley lines, he needs symbols of his power that help translate his words and intention into material reality...

Can our protagonists prevent Voldemort from executing his grand plan to kidnap dozens of world leaders and heroes, raising an epic Evil Overlord castle, and gathering a bunch of magical artifacts of supreme power?
