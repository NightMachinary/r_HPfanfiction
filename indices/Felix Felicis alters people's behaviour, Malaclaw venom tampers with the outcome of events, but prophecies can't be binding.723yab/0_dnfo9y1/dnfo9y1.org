Perhaps a seer can only make prophecies if the conditions are such that the prophecy will be fulfilled? As in if Snape hadn't been listening, Trelawney wouldn't have made the prophecy. Or would have made it in another place at another time.

What i'm proposing is that seers can only make prophecies about things that will happen, even if a prophecy predicts it. The prophecy or fate won't force it to happen, merely it's just a prediction of the future, but the prediction itself isn't informative enough to bring about any meaningful change, only changing a few minor things.

Minor things like the fact that Voldemort would have probably come after Potters eventually, merely at a later date, since they had defied him several times, and he probably still would have tried to kill Harry even without a prophecy, to tie up loose ends.

As for some prophecies being unfulfilled, perhaps the usual divination can later give enough information to bring about change and the divining itself can't be predicted by prophecy.
