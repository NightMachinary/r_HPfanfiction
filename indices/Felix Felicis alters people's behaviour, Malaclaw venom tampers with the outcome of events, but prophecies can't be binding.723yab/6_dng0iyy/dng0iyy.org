Maybe prophecies are only binding /IF/ someone hears it. Just like how felix felicis would obviously have no effect if not drunk, a prophecy would have no effect if no one knew about it. The prophecy could possibly have been preordained once spoken in the presence of dumbledore, regardless of whether or not snape was there to snitch to voldemort. Dumbledore would have placed security measures in regards to Harry and Neville's safety after their birth and events would fall into place to ultimately result in a confrontation between Harry and Voldemort.
