In my headcanon Felix Felicitis is like the Path to Victory from Worm.

It will lead it's user always to the desired outcome, as long as it's in any way possible to achieve.

Just except with Felix there is no conscious control over the parameters of the desired goal. Felix decides what's best for. Not you yourself.
