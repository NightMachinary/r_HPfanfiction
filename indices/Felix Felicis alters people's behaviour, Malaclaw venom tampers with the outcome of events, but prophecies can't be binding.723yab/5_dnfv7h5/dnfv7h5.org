I think you're making a mistake in assuming that the front door was the only way to get out of the castle that night, and that FF altered Filch's behavior in order to make it that way.

Maybe FF just makes the best of all possible options? For example, FF "knows" that the best end to the night is to get the memory, or uses the drinker's mind to determine the best end of the potion. Then it prompts the drinker to make choices to achieve their goal.

So if the front door had been closed that night, Harry would instead have had the sudden urge to jump out the window onto the back of a friendly hippogryph who'd just happened to be passing by.

I think that would work if the Malaclaw uses precognition to "unluckily" hunt.
