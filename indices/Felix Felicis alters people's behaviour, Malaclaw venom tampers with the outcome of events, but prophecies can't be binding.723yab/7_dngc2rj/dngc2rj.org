I believe the idea with Prophecies is that once they /start/ taking place they can't be stopped, but they can be ignored altogether. From the moment Voldemort heard the prophecy and acted on it, the rest of the thing was bound to come to pass; but if Snape hadn't overheard it and everyone had shut up about it it wouldn't have been realized.
