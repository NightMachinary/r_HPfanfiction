I wonder if the luck-bending properties of Felix Felicis and Malacaw venom are more due to what they cause the person to do. For instance, it's quite possible that Filch did forget to pick the doors and that he does so more often than we'd think, but we never see it because it's never important to the plot. And 2 teachers talking isn't that odd, nor is it odd for Sluggy to want to collect the acromantula venom. And we know there's nothing odd about Hagrid getting drunk. So what changed there is Harry. Normally, he would've gone to Slughorn's office. If he had that night, he would've been unlucky because Slughorn wasn't there. So by influencing him to go outside, the Felix Felicis caused him to take advantage of events and become luckier.

Similarly, Malacaw venom might cause people to make choices that seem like bad luck in hindsight. Betting on the wrong horse, or going the wrong way to find someone. Not looking before crossing the street. Stuff like that would seem like bad luck when it hurts them, but it's really a result of their choices.

So then we have prophecies. A couple posts have already mentioned the self-fulfilling nature of prophecies, and I think that's very accurate. It's the same in Harry Potter as in Greek mythology: someone hears a prophecy they don't like, they try to thwart it, and it actually sets the stage for the prophecy to come true. Just like Felix Felicis and Malacaw venom, it's not that fate is altered by the prophecy, but that a person's choices change in response and that causes the fulfillment. In a way it's also similar to how Time Turners work. Time travel is always a stable loop in canon (Cursed Child excepted) and the future cannot be changes because the future time travel has already happened in the past. Likewise, the prophecy is a read of the future based on choices people are making in response to it.

TL;DR version: predestination isn't a thing but precognition can be since it's based on the choices people make and everything is a giant mind-numbing loop
