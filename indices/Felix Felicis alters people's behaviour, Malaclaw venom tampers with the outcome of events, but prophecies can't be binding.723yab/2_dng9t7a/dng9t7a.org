I think time turners are also important to figuring this out. As we know from the third book, they create a fixed timeline ([[https://m.imgur.com/gallery/bc8Du]]). It seems Harry and Hermione were destined to go back in time no matter what. Does this mean everything is irrevocably destined to happen? When Harry uses the Felix Felicis in the sixth book, some of the "Luck" had happened before he drank it, such as Aragog's death or that Dean and Ginn were already going through a rocky patch in their relationship. Could it be that these had happened because Harry was destined to drink the Felix Felicis?
