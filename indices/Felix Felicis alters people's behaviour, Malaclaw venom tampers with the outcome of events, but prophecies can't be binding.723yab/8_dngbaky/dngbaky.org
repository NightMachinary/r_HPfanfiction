Its my head canon that the main ingredient in felix felicis is malaclaw venom with one of the important parts of the brewing being to increase the potency of the bad luck that the venom gives which is one of the reason it is so dangerous to get wrong. The other impotent step in the brewing is inverting the Bad luck from the venom so that it gives good luck.
