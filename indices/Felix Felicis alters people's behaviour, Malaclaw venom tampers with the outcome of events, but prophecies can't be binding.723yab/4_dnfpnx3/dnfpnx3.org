Prophecies only tell an extremely vague prediction of what can possibly happen/come to pass and it usually does happen because people take it at face value and act on it. Voldemort went after the Potters of his own accord and they weren't the only ones he could have went after. It's also highly likely he would have attacked them eventually anyway just did so sooner. If you never hear a prophecy you won't be as obligated to act on it. Also didn't Trelawney randomly start speaking it in a public place? I forgot where they were at the moment.
