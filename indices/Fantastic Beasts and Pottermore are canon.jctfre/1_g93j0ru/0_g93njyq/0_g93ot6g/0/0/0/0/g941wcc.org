And thus you have hit on why I - personally - refuse to accept Pottermore specifically as canon. It can be /changed/ far more easily than Books 1-7. Books 1-7 have been printed and while there were a few alterations based on edition (Enervate changed to Rennervate, an OOTP change based on whether prefects could take points etc etc) stuff can't be added or taken away without a complete reprinting and even then, that won't affect people who have older editions of the books. Pottermore can have stuff added and taken down.

The 1935 birthdate wasn't /stated/ on Pottermore but it's easily calculated from information taken off there.

In OOTP McGonagall says she's been teaching at Hogwarts for 39 years. Prior to that she worked for the Ministry for two years, starting right after finishing Hogwarts. There is no other career information given to us. You do the maths on that, you get 1935.

If she had been an adult and a teacher in the early 1900's, she would have either taught for considerably more years than 39 or would have had a massive gap in her teaching career.

Also Crimes of Grindelwald was a demonstrably bad movie and that is more than enough for me to ignore it.
