We live in an era where, more than ever before, people tend to hold the view that everyone is entitled to their own opinion which is not to be questioned, criticised, or described as untrue. The post-truth era, they say.

I think this applies equally to the HP fandom. Increasingly people reject the idea of an objective authority in favour of every individual person determining their own HP reality.

It's not hard to see that the core motive behind people rejecting parts of the HP universe is the fact that they personally dislike those parts. Properly analysed, this is not so much a rejection of the canonicity of specific sources, but rather an attack on the very concept of canon itself. The whole idea of canon is that it is not subject to the personal preferences and whims of individual fans: canon consists of the facts of the universe, whether you like those facts or not.

In the past, if you disliked those facts, you just shrugged your shoulders and wrote an AU fanfic. Now, however, people increasingly assert that their personal preference is sufficient to allow them to define their own personal canon. But a subjective canon is a contradiction in terms, because the core concept of a canon is that it forms an objective authority.

Rather than admit this contradiction, however, people seem to persist in asserting their subjective canon. Ultimately I think this is an act of denial: for some reason, people are unwilling to just accept that they dislike parts of canon, but instead try to maintain the idea of canon and simultaneously bend it to suit their personal preferences.
