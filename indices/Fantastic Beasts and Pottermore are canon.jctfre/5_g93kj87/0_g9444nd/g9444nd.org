I disagree.

I have yet to see anybody actively reject Books 1-7 as an objective authority. Disagreeing with them, disliking them or simply ignoring parts of them for the purpose of creating fic, yes, but not seriously denying that they are canon.

Everything else is it's own massive kettle of fish. In part because it's far, far more subject to change.

Let's say JKR tweets something which might radically and retrospectively change how book canon is interpreted. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that she says that Remus and Sirius were in love during the HP books and Harry simply didn't notice. Fandom explodes a bit. Wikis are edited etc etc. By your definition, that would be canon on the same level as the books.

Then, a week later, she deletes the tweet. Is it no longer canon? Even though people have screencaps or an archived web page of that tweet, it is no longer live and JKR clearly no longer thinks it is canon.

The level of often unthinking, apparently random additions that are made via social media or are simply put in the background of the movies, never expecting some eagle-eyed viewer to spot them, should they be considered the same level of canon as Books 1-7?

I'd also like to know whether you've encountered any of JKR's various additions which you vehemently disagreed with and how you felt about those? If Pottermore posted tomorrow about how magic was actually just like a muscle which could be exhausted if you did too much powerful magic, that magical cores were a thing, that magic could be categorised numerically and that Harry, Dumbledore and Voldemort all had absolutely massive magical cores which is why they could perform really cool magic would you accept that as canon?
