Yeah, the Star Wars approach, with varying tiers of canonicity

Books are canon, no ifs, ands, or buts.

the original series films are canon except where they contradict the books

The TMB films and other supplementary materials (Pottermore, FB and QTTA books) are below that

Then there's noncanon area with all sorts of fanfiction

then there's the Cursed Child.
