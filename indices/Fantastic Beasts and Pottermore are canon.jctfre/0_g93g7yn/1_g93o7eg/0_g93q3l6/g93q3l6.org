Just off the top of my head, from the last FB film:

Dumbledore teaching a boggart class (Defence Against the Dark Arts) when we'd previously been told he was a Transfiguration teacher

McGonagall being a teacher, when according to previous information she should have been a child or not even born - I can't remember exactly, I'm pretty sure her previous birth date was wiped from Pottermore when the second FB came out

There's also the matter of Credence/Aurelius Dumbledore. I'm assuming that he is not actually a Dumbledore, and it's just Grindelwald manipulating him, but that left a sour taste in my mouth after watching it
