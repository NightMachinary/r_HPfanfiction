I'm aware, and that's why I'm saying there are contradictions. The Dumbledore and McGonagall information came from information previously posted on Pottermore, which was contradicted in later films. So to avoid that mess, I just stick with book canon and pick and choose other elements as they suit me/what I'm writing.
