honestly I just can't be fucked watching the terrible movies, and never really engaged with Pottermore, so I just try to go off of the books.

it is what it is.

I pretty much always write AU though, so it isn't crucial.

But I mean, with an author that loves as retcon as much as Rowling does, I don't think you should get too stressed over which canon people choose, as Rowling herself set the precedent for just changing things whenever she damn well pleases.
