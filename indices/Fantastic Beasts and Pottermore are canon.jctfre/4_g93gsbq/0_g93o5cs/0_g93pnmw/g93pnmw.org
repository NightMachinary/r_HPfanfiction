Again, no one is saying you are not free to believe that. But i, and (from the other posts on here) many others choose to accept only the 7 books as canon. The rest is just a garbage cash grab, like how the Disney Star Wars movies are.

I never said you can't like what you like. But you can't force the rest of us to accept shitty retcons that ruin a story we enjoy.

As for JKR, if she wanted her absurd addendums to be part of the Potter universe, she should have put them in the books. If someone has to read a bunch of interviews with the author after the fact to gain the correct 'interpretation', it obviously isn't canon.
