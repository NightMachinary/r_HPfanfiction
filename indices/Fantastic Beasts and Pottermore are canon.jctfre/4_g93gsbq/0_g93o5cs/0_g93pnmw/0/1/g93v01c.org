So, out of curiosity (and as a hypothetical) - if Rowling had come back after book seven and posted on twitter that she'd changed Sirius' name to Sirius Jones, but all the books had already been printed with Black, which opinion would you go for?

Again, this is just a hypothetical. I'm simply curious as to your opinion. :)
