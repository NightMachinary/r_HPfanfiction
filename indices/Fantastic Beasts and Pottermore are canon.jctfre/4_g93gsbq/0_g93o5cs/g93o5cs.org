FB is not about Johnny Depp, it's a harry potter prequel that focuses on Newt Scamander trying to bring Grindelwald down.

Anything that JK says or writes about I considered it canon because at the end of the day she wrote the books, she had a clear view of how she wanted her world to be.

The books were written by JK, not the HP Fandom.
