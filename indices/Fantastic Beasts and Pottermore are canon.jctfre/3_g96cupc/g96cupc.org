The word "canon," /in this context/, doesn't really have an agreed-upon definition, to my knowledge. It's a weird, complicated, murky, and ultimately kinda meaningless thing that we could debate all day without accomplishing anything. I, for one, don't consider anything canon to the HP series other than the books themselves. You can disagree with me, but, like, I don't care, because why would I? Death of the Author is a thing that exists. Also:

  I'm just baffled by such statements because this is what the HP Fandom has been asking for. For more of the Wizarding World.

Each Harry Potter fan does not speak for every Harry Potter fan. The fact that some people wanted more content in no way contradicts the fact that some people disliked the new content. Hell, even if we assume that the same people who don't consider CC, FB, Pottermore, etc canon are all people who were clamouring for new HP content, it /still/ isn't contradictory, since, presumably, they wanted /good/ content that feels in line with the original stories, both of which are /totally subjective/.
