Was reading the subject line thinking "this sounds familiar, but it's probably not a h/d since there are so few h/ders here." Haha... So, I'm pretty sure I read this story too. But I can't remember what it is either. Whenever new challenges came out, I'd chain read them, which often meant they'd blur together :(

Have you gone through the [[http://bigbang.inkubation.net/][post-HBP big bang]] yet? That's where I'd start.

Maybe the [[http://hd-worldcup.livejournal.com/][HD World Cup]], but now that I'm going through the links, their site where they hosted all the fics is gone so that's incredibly frustrating. Why you gotta host on your own domain and then let it expire :(

I'll keep thinking on it. I /know/ I've read a fic with children inferi at an orphanage.

edit: actually, is this it? [[http://bigbang.inkubation.net/sleeper.html][Abide the Sleeper]] by Furiosity and Imadra Blue. Also on [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=12905][skyehawk]]
