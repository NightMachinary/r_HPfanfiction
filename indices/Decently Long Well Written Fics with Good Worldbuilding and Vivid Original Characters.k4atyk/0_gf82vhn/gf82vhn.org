Sorry to get to this so late, just found it in search.

That's a great list, I love almost all of those fics and I'm really happy to see you include some great fics(LEBS, COHW) that are pretty damn obscure. I think our tastes are pretty similar; I have also found myself going down this rabbit hole and it's a super frustrating process to find fics that have both fantastic writing and that super-level of creativity.

That said, there's still some stuff I'd /highly/ recommend that's not on your list.

*Stygian Trilogy by Slide* - it's probably the best next-gen series I've read (not counting AQ) - better writing and characterization than either of the big Albus Potter series, and great pacing and an exciting plot. There's romance, but it pretty much takes a backseat to the plot for the most part. It has very good OC's and is quite wildly AU.

*Phoenix and the Serpent* - this may have flew under your radar because it was written in 2002, before OOTP. It reads like a modern fic, and the OCs are just incredible.

*The Pureblood Pretense* is popular here and is extremely good. A very creative and expansive AU with a cool story and really nice additions to the magical canon a la NoahPhantom. Less crazy but probably a tad better-written is *Victoria Potter,* which has a protagonist very similar to Alexandra Quick but a little more tactical and less instinctual.

*Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived* is a megaclassic, and has great OCs and worldbuilding as well. *Subversion* is a nice response to the WBWL genre and has extraordinarily snappy writing.

Glad to know there's someone else out there looking for this sort of stuff! And I'll check out some of the stuff I haven't read on your list (Against the Moon, Order of Mercy, Call to Arms, Aurors, Final Chapter, Unseen Monsters, Forest Guard).

EDIT: I'm being unclear about what AU means: I consider a fic AU if the worldbuilding is any different than canon, even if it builds upon it. So by the traditional definition only Phoenix and the Serpent, Boy Who Lived, Subversion, and Pretense are AU.
