The wiki is almost certainly not accurate in this respect. I'd put the highest estimates far lower than 500 million. That would place the population at over 1:20.

I'd say that at 2.5 billion wizards, wizards would rule in the open. Muggles would be lower-class citizens after wizards. Magical products would be employed daily. Technological development would likely never have really occurred (high quality of life means that the Wizarding population will have been high for a long time).
