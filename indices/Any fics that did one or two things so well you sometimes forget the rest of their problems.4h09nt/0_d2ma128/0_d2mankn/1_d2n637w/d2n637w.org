The second person view was a very nice brain stretch. Want to know a not-nice brain stretch? I once attempted to read a published(!) book called Seatrain where the author replaced every "and" with an ampersand (&). Reading it was comparable to hitting very well defined speed bump at 30 mph (50kph for you brits), repeatedly, every other sentence.
