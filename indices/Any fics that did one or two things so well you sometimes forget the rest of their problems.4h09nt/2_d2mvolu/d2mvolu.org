linkffn(By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept) is so unique and offbeat that I can completely forgive it for having Petunia as a main character, being a Severitus fic, and running about a gazillion words long without any sign of slowing down.

Edited to add: and the writing isn't bad, not in the least. I quite like it, in fact. It's the premise that seems terrible but amazingly isn't.
