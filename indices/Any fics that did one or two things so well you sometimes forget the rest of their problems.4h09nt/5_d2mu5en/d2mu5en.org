There is one fic that has stuck with me for three years. In terms of grammar and spelling, it's fantastic. But it's a nightmare in terms of content--the biggest issue is an untagged-and-unwarned-for rape scene (technically coerced consent, but one character is very obviously manipulating the situation in his favour in a very creepy way). A second chapter was added more recently, and like the first, it's at best pure porn.

But the themes, oh man the themes. I'm really sad the author didn't elaborate on them, because there's some REALLY fascinating potential there. And it turned me on to an aspect of the pairing that I had previously been unaware of, and which is sadly still REALLY rare--I don't think I've ever read another fic that arranges them in a similar way, or not a decently explicit one at least.

Such wasted potential.
