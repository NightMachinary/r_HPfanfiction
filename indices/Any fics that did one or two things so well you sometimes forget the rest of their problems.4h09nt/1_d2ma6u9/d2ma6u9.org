linkffn(In Atlantean Caves) is a lot like NMB's By the Divining Light (which I will not link, because it is actually a great fic). By that, I mean that it gives me a sense of fantasy and wonder that you don't see often in fanfiction--most of the time, magic feels so boring and utilitarian.

It also has poor, tell-over-show writing, pointless romance and drama, and (most glaringly) is abandoned.
