linkffn(12446118), Harry goes to the world and meets his counterpart. Unique because Harry doesn't fix all their problems, and its from femHarry's POV. My favorite in the genre. Pew Pew!

Rent a Hero also fits this as well, although it is abandoned. Love the interactions between Harry and femHarry, and yet again Harry doesn't just solve everything. Harry is a bit angsty and bitter, but it doesn't hurt the story too much.
