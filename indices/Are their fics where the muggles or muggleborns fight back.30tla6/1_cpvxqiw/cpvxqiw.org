Eventually becomes a muggle aid sort of fic, although with the passage of time, this fic isn't really holding up for me personally. I still think it's fairly original though.

I knew of another one at one point, involving a time travelling Hermione, but as I recall, I stopped pretty quickly, finding the fic pretty unbelievable and hard to read a result. The story begins with the muggles nuking the last remaining wizards just as Hermione blasts herself into the past.
