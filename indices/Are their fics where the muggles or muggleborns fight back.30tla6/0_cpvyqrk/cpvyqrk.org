This is more about muggleborns fighting for their rights within the wizarding community, during and after the war with Voldemort. It was really interesting to me, as I don't read much Hermione POV fic, and was interested in the civil rights aspects. The plot is a bit similar to the one linked, about how those in power can create laws or imprison muggleborns without consequence; it eventually goes into the political aspects and how to fight back or change the system. A few words of warning, it starts out Harry/Hermione and ends up Harry/Severus, but you can easily skip the Snarry scenes without missing anything if that's not something you want to read.

  /'It's not just Death Eaters that kill Muds. After the Second World War, the Muggle civil rights movements got started. Black rights, and feminism, and gay rights. We -- wizards -- we never had the sixties, because we just kept replaying the war, over and over again: Grindelwald in the forties, then Voldemort in the seventies, then Voldemort again in the nineties. I just hope this time it's really finished, and we can sort out our own fucking house.'/

  Hermione is back at school after a summer in the Muggle world, and everything is changing. But getting closer to Harry doesn't get her any closer to the war - until she's unexpectedly enrolled in the Order of the Phoenix, and meets Hestia Jones, the founder of Mud Pride.
