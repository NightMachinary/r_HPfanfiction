1) The wizarding world is heavily euro-centric. Wands were created in Europe and slowly spread around the globe, quite similar to firearms. Those who do not use the wand (such as some Native American and African tribes), specialize in their local magic but tend to be unable to compete with the average European/Asian wizard. This is also why there are only 11 'ivy league' schools, with 4-5 of them being in Europe. Large wizarding schools tend to focus on the use of the wand, aka 'eurasian' magic.

2) The ICW is dominated by european and asian countries as well, as they are the main supporters for the SoS. They have heavily-handingly shoved the other nations in line. You have exceptions for various tribes around the world, but overall the ICW makes sure the SoS is being enforced.

3) Latin is the main base for most of Europe, due to the wand coming from Italy, and the fact that the upper nobility tended to be able to speak it. As the SoS was enacted in the 1600s, we are looking at a completely different world, ruled by a few large empires. The exceptions of 'latin based' spells would be Scandinavia/Baltics, Russia, and maybe the germanic nations (if you want to go that route). Eastern Europe would be dominated by the Turks, which use Greek based spells (very similar to latin) with some war-like curses in their own native languages, and Arabic.

4) Outside of Europe, the magical world is split into smaller nations, as in no magical india (instead various regions), tons of tribes and groups in Africa and South America (which is split between muggleborns from colonists and the native wizards). Some groups may be better at small sections of magic, or focus on certain aspects of it (perhaps some groups are dedicated healers), but overall magic is roughly the same. All groups still need summoning charms, curses, and more.
