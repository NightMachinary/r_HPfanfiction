I've been working a while on how would Magic work on this world and so far I got this:

Magic through the World:

Africa The first humans appeared in √Åfrica millions of years ago, it took them thousands more to understand Magic. As the tribes grew in size and power wizards also became more powerful, the Modern Magic system taught in most of Africa was based on the Tribal Magic system, but evolved to use written language, Uagadou (the largest african school) have particulary specialized itself in Astronomy, Alchemy and Self-Transfiguration. Wands are primarily a European invention, and although African wizards have adopted them as useful tools, Uagadou students prefer to cast spells simply by Handweaving, which makes them versatile wizards but less powerful and limits their overall spell knowledge.

Asia As the first Tribal Shamans expanded through Asia, not only their Tribal Magic adapted to their enviroment but also to their philosophies and practices, the birth of the first cities, organized religions and societies as well as the arrival of written language, gave birth to a new type of Magic as well as the first recorded "Spells". Mesopotamia, Egypt and the middle/near East cultures put a strong emphasis in "spellcasting", transfiguration/conjuration, Alchemy and Warding. The Far East cultures instead, while developed a strong political/religious sociocultural system, mantained their Tribal approach to Magic while focusing in self-transfiguration (as well as Alchemy), through breathing and Martial Arts, Warding, conjuration and basic elemental evocation. Asia in general prefers the use of Focii of the "Pentagram/Sword types" (Jade rings, Magical Circles, Jians, etc).

Europe The original indo-european settlers that traversed Eurasia were purely knowlegded on the Tribal system, however, with the influence of the near-asian Magical cultures and the advent of the greek Polis and the philosophical thinking, greek wizardry grew and developed to an extremely advanced stage, becoming the basis for Modern Western wizardry. The Greek Magic School, specialized in Spellcasting, use of Foci (particulary Wands and Chalices), elemental evocation, transfiguration and some minor use of conjuration. The greeks developed the schools of Mysteries, secret covens of Wizards devoted to study and orally transmit the knowledge of certain powerful forms of Magic, these are the precursors of the currents Departments of Mysteries. The first effective Wands were developed in the days of the ancient greeks.This Magic School of thought expanded through Asia with the great armies of Alexander the Great, but reached it's peak not by itself, but by Serving as the Grand base of the Roman School of Magic. The Romans begun their Magic work as a Confederation of Tribes evolving towards a proper Magic Society on top of the Roman one. The Romans specialized in whats been called the "interpretatio romana", the cultural trait to adapt into their own culture others' cultures by finding local equivalents and renaming after it. This trait key in the formation of the Roman Expansionism, was also key in the formation of the Roman Magic system: a unified Magic system copying others cultures'magic and renaming them with the Latin language as the base. The German invaders arrived carrying many types of Tribal Magic, but just as the Nomaji german Tribes slowly became vassals of the Romans, so did their Shamans, slowly turning their knowledge towards the Roman Magic. The fall of the Roman Empire heralded the rise of the Germanic Kingdoms, a hybrid of the Roman and germanic cultures, and so the wizarding SPQR relinquished their power to the new Wizarding comunities appearing in Europe.Europe in general prefers the use of Focii of the "Wand/Pentagram types" (Wands, Staves and sometimes Magical Circles).

America The original inhabitants of the American continent were all well verse Magic Users of the Tribal system, with the arrival of the European Nomajis/Wizards conflict ensued and the strong european colonization, the Magic system that has rooted in the continent is the "Classical one", particulary the European system. In Latinamerica and mostly in the Azteca Empire, the magic users specialized in Blood Magic, particularing using human sacrificies to fuel wards and offensive curses. America, by the tradition inherited by Europe usually prefers the use of Focii of the "Wand/Pentagram types" (Wands, Staves and sometimes Magical Circles), but Handweaving and other focci are used.

Oceania The modern "continent" of Oceania comprises Australia, New Zealand, polinesia and micronesia. The whole area is populated by seafaring aboriginal nations characterized by their use of Tribal Magic, with the arrival of the Europeans (particualry in Australia and New Zealand), the Classical school became one of the most practiced.
