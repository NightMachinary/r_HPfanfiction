You could also argue that Canon shows Harry's views. As a young person not exposed to magic growing up, even the "mundane" things would be magical to him and thus mentioned in his point of view. It's the narrator that limits the universe not the universe is for sure limited.

I believe with the right context and characterization foreign magic and culture could most certainly exist within "canon". Just IMO. I love the idea of diversity in magic and magical cultures across the world, different than mundane boundaries and views.
