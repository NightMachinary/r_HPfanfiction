That'd mean Barty Crouch Sr. (or anyone who knows a lot of languages, or anyone who changes his knowledge-base significantly) would need to learn different spells, and there'd be fluency specific schools, with priority given to non-verbal / "instinctual" spells.

An easier way around this is to just assume that in most parts of Europe (or maybe what is called "Anglo"), Latin was upheld and magic was practised the way it should have been, while in other conutries despots subjugated "lesser" wizards to muggle culture.
