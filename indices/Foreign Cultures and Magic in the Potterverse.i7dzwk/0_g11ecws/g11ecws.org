Personally my view is that magic is universal, but incantations may vary. That is: the content of a spell is its conceptual apparatus, not the word used to invoke it. The concept of "summon" is the same everywhere, regardless of what language you use to express it, and therefore the spell behaves the same everywhere. But a different label may attach to it.

If you do want to make varied foreign magic systems, however, I think the most important thing to keep in mind is Newcomb's Rule:

#+begin_quote
  I think a good question to ask yourself whenever you're adding foreign magic to your story is, "why is this not widespread in magical Britain?"

  If your answer isn't a common-sense, basically reasonable one, if it feels like you have to contort yourself around your premise or force it, or if the answer ends up using any variation of the "wizarding Britain is actually very backwards and dumb" trope, re-consider the magic you're trying to introduce.

Basically: don't fall so in love with a foreign magic system that you make it OP. Because anything that was OP would naturally spread around the world as wizards everywhere adopted it for its utility. See: wands in canon.

To add to this rule, I would say that you can't pay too much respect to foreign cultures.

A while back there was a Twittergasm around JKR's use of American Indian folklore in a way that didn't accurately reflect the real-world belief systems (historical and contemporary) of American Indians.

The problem with this is that the essential approach of the HP magic system towards folklore, myths and legends is to subvert that mythology. With very few exceptions, the HP universe takes mythological things and changes them dramatically:

- In mythology, Pegasus was a unique, legendary figure, the offspring of a god. In HP, winged horses are used to draw carriages and they drink whisky.

- In mythology, dragons are majestic, powerful creatures. In HP, they are kept in reserves and farmed for wand/potions ingredients.

- In folklore, ghosts are terrifying malevolent spirits. In HP, they are mascots who celebrate their death like a birthday.

All of this fits with a magic system where magic is principally used for cooking, cleaning and office work. The tone of the HP series is one of taking magic and grounding it in the normalcy of day-to-day life, while retaining the spark of romanticism that makes the magic feel magical.

With this in mind, I think that paying too much respect to the folklore of various cultures will result in worldbuilding elements which fundamentally contradict the established tone of the canon worldbuilding. If you want to produce material for non-Western magical cultures which matches the tone of the HP worldbuilding, you need to change and subvert that mythology, /not/ just stick it wholesale into the story, without alteration.
