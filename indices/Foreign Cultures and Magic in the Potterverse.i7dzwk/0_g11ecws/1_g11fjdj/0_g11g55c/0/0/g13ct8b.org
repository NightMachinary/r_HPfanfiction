There is the radio system, and for years people did not have access to news of what was happening in other countries off hand. The internet is still a relatively new invention, especially the prevalence of it. Generally, you only had easy access to what was in your local newspaper, and thus what the editors of that paper felt fit to print for you. Other ways that happened in metropolitan areas were in coffee shops, breweries, etc.
