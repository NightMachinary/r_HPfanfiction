I'm not really sure what relevance newspapers have to magic.

In any event, it would also be extremely odd for a foreign newspaper to be mentioned. People typically do not read newspapers from other countries, nor are they generally available for purchase. Certainly in Muggle Britain foreign newspapers are not obtainable as a matter of routine - only really in certain areas of London, and even then only the NYT and El Pais.
