I mean, I could make an argument that foreign cultures simply don't get along with Wizarding Britain due to it's previous status as an imperialistic power... and that Wizards and Witches have a long memory due to their long lives.

I went into more detail on this in another comment, but can you name a single foreign newspaper from a magical culture mentioned in the Harry Potter book, for instance? I can think of a reason or two why they would be brought up, but to my knowledge, they simply weren't.
