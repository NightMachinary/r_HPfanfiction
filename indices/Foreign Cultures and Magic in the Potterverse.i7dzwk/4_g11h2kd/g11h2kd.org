Before you look at the other end of the World, I'd be a lot more interested in the situation around Europe. The magical world diverged in 1692, long before nationalism, the industrial and agricultural revolution and all related effects. Back in those days, Belgium was called the Spanish Netherlands, most of Poland(-Lithuania) was way east of where you'd find Poland today, there was no Italy, what became Yugoslavia or Germany and...

So how exactly did things change in the magical world without the influences of muggles? There was no French Revolution, Napoleon and Vienna to change the political landscape, no world wars, imperialism and decolonisation and so on. Hell, most of what would become the US was French or no man's land, so I am pretty sure that whatever Rowling came up with for FB is not well researched.

I am not sure that you can answer any of these questions to the satisfaction of everyone, and defining who owns what and which conflicts resulted is pretty important to figuring out what a culture looks like. The World Wars impacted Europe very deeply in that regard, as did the French Revolution. So whatever magical France is like, it ought to be very different from what we know today as France, including its people. Nevermind the other side of the globe.
