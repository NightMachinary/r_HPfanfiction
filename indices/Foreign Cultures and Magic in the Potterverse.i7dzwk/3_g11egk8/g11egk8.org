Supporting Points on why Wizarding Britain would have once been the most powerful Wizarding Nation:

1. Magical Britain should generally have matched Imperial Britain.
2. Grindelwald was at least on the level of an international terrorist, and with magic in the equation... Europe would have produced some of the best Wizards in the world, along with Dumbledore.
3. There are a disproportionate number of Wizarding Schools in Europe to Wizarding Schools elsewhere in the world, at least listed on Pottermore.

Supporting Points on why Wizarding Britain is likely more on par with other countries in the modern age:

1. With the Statute of Secrecy, it is doubtful that Wizarding Britain would have been able to lead wars against other countries to keep them subjugated underneath them.
2. Due to Binns status as a bad history teacher, such that most students sleep in his class, Wizarding Britain probably has had a bad education in terms of World History, and thus international relationships, for quite a while. Combined with inherited arrogance, this means that Wizarding Britain would have had disproportionate trade agreements and unfamiliarity with foreign magics.
3. Finally, this last one is a bit of a doozy. Given the curse on the defense position, outcomes like the average adult being unable to cast even a basic shield spell should be taken as the likely and natural conclusion. Aurors would be trained from an irregularly bad base, and magical research will be negligible in this field. Thus, while other countries will have grown disproportionately faster due to factors like their previously subjugated state and Wizarding Britain practically being served up to them on a silver platter, it can be concluded that foreign countries will have grown stronger and that Wizarding Britain will have grown weaker.
4. Due to the culture of arrogance from Imperial Britain towards other cultures having likely been sustained till the modern day, with the supporting evidence that something like "Harry Potter slandered by Magical Britain's Ministry of Magic" likely being brought up in foreign newspapers. Of course, given how this was never brought up, not even for a citation in the Quibbler, /and/ how other such newspapers were never mentioned... this has interesting implications.
