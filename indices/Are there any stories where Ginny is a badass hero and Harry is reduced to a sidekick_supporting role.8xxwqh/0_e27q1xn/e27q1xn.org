I feel like I write a reasonably strong Ginny character. In my AU, Ginny has a thing about helping magical creatures out of sticky situations. Ginny is the primary actor in these and Harry is mostly along for the ride. The latest one of these is The Ghost of the Redcoat where Ginny has to re-home a ghost. Warning: Explicit.
