Part of the reason for H/Hr vs H/G shipping is that we see the story from Harry's point of view. This means we do NOT see all of the time H/R spend together away from him, or the times Ron was very sweet to her etc. This also means we see a LOT of interaction between Harry and Hermione.

As opposed to Ginny who disappears (in relationship building type ways) for most of 4 books, and is suddenly the center of his hormonal world.

My FFN name is GinnyMyLove because I started off very much a Ginny Shipper... but over time I've decided Hermione would have been a better match.... I can no longer say if that is because of Fanon or canon...

I have read so much fanfiction that I'll take almost any M/F ship or harem to get my romance or smut fix. But H/G and H/Hr have special places for me...I almost can't stand to see Hermione end up with anyone but Harry. ...unless they make Ron more awesome and sweet to her than in the books.
