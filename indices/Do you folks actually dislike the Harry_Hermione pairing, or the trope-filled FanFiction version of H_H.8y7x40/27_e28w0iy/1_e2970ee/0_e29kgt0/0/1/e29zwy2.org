  Dumbledore into a manipulative chessmaster
#+end_quote

That's not really a leap in logic. Canon states this very explicitly, at least twice (Dumbledore+Harry at the end of OotP and Dumbledore+Snape at the end of DH).

I don't understand why there are people who pretend that Dumbledore being manipulative is some kind of Dumbledore bashing fanon theory.
