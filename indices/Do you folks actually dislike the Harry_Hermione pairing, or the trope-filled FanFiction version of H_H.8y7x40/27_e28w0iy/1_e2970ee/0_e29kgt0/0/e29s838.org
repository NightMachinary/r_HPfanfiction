The problem is really reading this as an adult vs as a kid. Or possibly the third or fourth re-reading of it. There are leaps of logic that are very easy to make which turn Ginny or Molly into amortentia rapists, Dumbledore into a manipulative chessmaster, Harry is holding himself back because he had to do so to avoid getting in trouble for beating Dudley in tests / doesn't want to lose Ron or Hermione as friends because he's better than they are, and Ron would drive Hermione just as crazy as she could Harry

Basically... it works great as a kids series... the problem is the kids grew up before the characters did thanks to the publishing schedule.

In either case, I'm not an anti-shipper (unless it is Molly, or Draco, or Snape) and I can enjoy H/G as much as H/Hr... I went through my shipping phase, and through basically every named female character in the books plus plenty of OC's and crossover characters.

To me, it takes much less work to make H/Hr work than to make R/Hr work in a more mature plot. Ron has more "growing up" to do than Harry to make a relationship with Hermione work...

But that's like... just my opinion man.
