I feel like it has to be fanon that pushed you there because canon is quite deliberate to show that Harry and Hermione have a younger brother/older sister dynamic. Which would be quite unhealthy in an actual relationship. Hermione is awesome, but she is absolutely a nag and Harry can appreciate that in the dynamic they do have, but would absolutely hate that in an actual partner. The thing about Hermione is she the one you want in battle with you, as evidence by how reliable she was on the Horcrux hunt but not the one you want to hang out with on a day to day level in a normal life.

And this is ultimately the big problem with the pairing; it does not factor in how these two people would interact one-on-one on a daily basis. While obviously Harry and Hermione get along, canon frequently points out that it typically is when Ron is also around. In Goblet of Fire, Harry even mentions directly how much less fun it is hanging out with just Hermione.

Ginny works very well with Harry because she simply knows how to handle him better and shares far more interests and a sense of humor. Humor and the ability to have fun are extremely important attributes Harry seeks in a partner, and Ginny has that in spades, while Hermione is sorely lacking.
