I don't think he's saying Hermione is lazy, more how's she's written. JKR has said in the past that at times Hermione was a SI of sorts. As with all SIs they have flaws but in the end they're almost always right. Hermione has more plot armour than almost anyone else. Her actions rarely have negative consequences, even when she's got no reason to be correct it turns out she was right all along. Book 3 is one of my least favourite for that reason. Hermione has no reason to be right about Crookshanks not killing Scabbers. Harry goes as far as to not pick sides but thinks Ron's arguement makes sense. Turns out she's right. Not only did Crookshanks not kill Scabbers but Scabbers was a villain. Harry and the Broom, strange broom without a note is suspicious but to jump to Sirius Black buying it is extreme. She has no reason to think its possible for him to buy it. He's the most wanted person in the country. Turns out Crookshanks and owl orders make all things possible but still, its a bit contrived but what do you know, she's right in the end. The only time I can think where she's really wrong is book 6 with the Malfoy thing but I think most people agree that book 6 was a character assassination on both Ron and Hermione.
