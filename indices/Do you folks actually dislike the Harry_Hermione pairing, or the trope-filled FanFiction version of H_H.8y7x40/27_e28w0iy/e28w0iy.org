I loath the fanon version of perfect, super-smart Hermione. I already find her to be an incredibly lazy SI in canon, as her whole character doesn't make sense to me, but there she at least has redeeming features as well as less focus put on her. I have found most H/Hr shine a very bright spotlight on her.

Regarding the H/Hr pairing in canon, where does this even come from? I think that Ginny's character was horribly mistreated but Hermione is basically not even relevant as a romantic interest and there is a clear build-up for Ron/Hermione.
