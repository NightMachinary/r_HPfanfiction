  It does maybe fall into the trap of making Hermione a bit too perfect

It's usual for his stories.

  but not so much that it's worth abandoning

Yes, it is so much.

Basically his story doesn't show any meaningful relationships between Harry and Hermione up to 40+ chapters. For the whole time she is lying and deceiving Harry and still consider herself his friend.

He tried to show some teenager's mistakes in the relationships, but totally ignored that environment around them should react to actions of the heroes (like parents of 14 year old girl won't ignore that she's having sex with 16 year old boy). In his story everyone (especially adults) just support any stupid actions of MCs.

I dropped the story before they got together, but I'm sure that his Harry will be a pitiful emo, when it comes to Hermione, and the latter will play with him for some time and then will just decide to accept him, because the tags require it. All her wrongdoings towards him (or anybody) will be ignored, because... she is Hermione.

tl;dr: his romances are very good examples how they shouldn't be written and one of the reasons why some fanfic readers hate HHr.
