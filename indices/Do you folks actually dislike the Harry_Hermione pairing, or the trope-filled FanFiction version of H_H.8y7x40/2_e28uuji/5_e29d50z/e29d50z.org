I like StarFox's H/Hr relationship in her latest Harry Potter and the Lady Thief. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief by Starfox5). I think her Harry in the story is weird, and he does this pervy thing with these special magical glasses, but their relationship itself avoids most of the pitfalls you describe. She is described as attractive which I know you don't like, but she also grows up differently with different training which includes physical training, which does affect one's attractiveness. My main thing is avoiding bashing, and it does that by having Ron fall for his true opposite, Luna. It doesn't bash Dumbledore, in fact he's more of a hero than ever. It does maybe fall into the trap of making Hermione a bit too perfect, but not so much that it's worth abandoning the fic.
