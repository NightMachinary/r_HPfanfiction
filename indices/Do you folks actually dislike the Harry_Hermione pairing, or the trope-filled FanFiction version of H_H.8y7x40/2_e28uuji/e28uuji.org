In the books we see Harry get crushes on both Cho and Ginny. They weren't hidden from us, as we read the books from Harry's perspective. We know how he's feeling. We've never seen him think about Hermione in any other way other than as a best friend, not even at the Yule Ball when he was more surprised by Hermione actually being pretty than anything else. So it bothers me when people say it was obvious in the books until the end that he was going to end up with her, and that they felt cheated by JKR for not giving them their "obviously canon" ship. It was obvious that it was going to at least start out with Ron and Hermione getting together at some point before anything.

People like to hate on Ron for being dumb, or not sensitive, or not at all Hermione's type or whatever. People don't have to be exactly alike for relationships to work, sometimes like attracts like, and sometimes opposites attract. Every single relationship is unique. Their reasoning is absurd and built on this fantasy perfect relationship between Harry and Hermione.

So I don't hate the pairing. I've just never seen it done well. If it's not making Ron out to be a bad guy, which is most of H/Hr fics, it's making Hermione out to be this perfect woman, which she isn't. She's actually really vicious and petty, incredibly stubborn, and refuses to admit when she's wrong. But that's good. Characters should have flaws. It's what makes them interesting to read about.

And lastly, but most importantly, she's not Emma Watson. She actively has to try and spend hours to look incredibly attractive.

I avoid H/Hr fics for these reasons. Show me one that has a good length and grammar and plot etc, doesn't bash characters (Ron and Dumbledore especially), and doesn't have muggle-wanking, and I'd love to give it a shot.
