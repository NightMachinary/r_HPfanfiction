You have to also keep in mind that Rowling wrote the book that way so at the end we had this big happy weasly family so deliberately wrote it so Harry never thought of Hermione as more than a friend even though she's always stuck by him and always looked out for his best intrests even though they might not have always liked it.

Hermione Is by no means vicious and petty.
