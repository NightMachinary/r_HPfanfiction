Gave umbridge ptsd-no your right Hermione should've just let umbridge use the cruciatus curse on Harry and not think of a way out of the situation

Half blood prince-ill give ya that one but she was more suspicious of the book than anything and it had nothing to do with Harry "being better"

Not inviting ron-wow! Can't beileve it your right here too inviting Ron while he was in a relationship with lavender would've gone smoothly

Capturing rita-an unregistered animagus who was sneaking into the grounds and spreading nasty rumours about her and her friends wow can't beileve how visious Hermione hranger is should've been in Slytherin!

Attacking Ron with birds-that evil bitch! How dare she send birds on Ron after he gets done snogging lavender in the middle of the common room which he probably only did after ginny called him out on getting no action and Hermione snogging krum doesn't 'justify the action' but the fact is your just looking for stuff to pin on Hermione if anybody's 'petty' it's you lol
