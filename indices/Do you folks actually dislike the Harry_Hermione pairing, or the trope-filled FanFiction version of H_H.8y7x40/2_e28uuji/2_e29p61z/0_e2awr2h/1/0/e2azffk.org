Been a while since you've read the books, eh? At the point when they argued about the Slug Club, Ron wasn't in a relationship with Lavender. Harry literally noticed Hermione glaring hatefully at his potion's book. She was /pissed/ that he was doing better than her even though he wasn't following the actual procedure.

And what? You don't attack someone with a flock of birds because they kissed someone else, especially when you weren't in a relationship with them at the time. There is no excuse for that, you're grasping.

It doesn't matter if she had reasons for doing what she did. She still did these things which were vicious and petty and never showed signs of remorse. Like I said, sometimes it was understandable, but it doesn't change the fact that she did these things.

I'm not exactly sure why we're arguing about this. These are facts laid out in canon. If you want to warp your reality and ignore these scenes, then that's your prerogative. You do you.
