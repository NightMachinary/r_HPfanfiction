lmao the point is that when they had the initial argument and Hermione said she wouldn't invite him, which was the only part I mentioned in my original comment, Ron wasn't together with Lavender. I honestly am questioning if you understand the nature of time.

The party is way off in the future. The only event we're concerned about is my example of Hermione being petty, which was during Herbology. If you look at the timeline (you read it left to right, by the way) that's the first point. Ron gets with Lavender near the middle of the timeline. We're not even concerned with that, other than the fact that that was when they first became a couple. Lavender was NOT in the picture during my example of Hermione being petty. That is literally all that matters, and I have to question again, why are you arguing against facts. It's like you're arguing the sky isn't blue or something.
