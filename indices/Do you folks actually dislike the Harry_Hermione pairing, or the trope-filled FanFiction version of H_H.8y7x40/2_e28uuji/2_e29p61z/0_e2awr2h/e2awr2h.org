Severely disfigured a teenage girl's face because she confided in authority figures who she should be able to trust -- *vicious*.

Gave Umbridge PTSD -- *vicious.*

Got angry at Harry when he started doing better in potions than her because he was following the instructions from Snape's old book -- *petty.*

Didn't invite Ron to the Slug Club because they had an argument -- *petty.*

Kept Rita Skeeter in a jar for who knows how long -- both *vicious* and *petty*.

Attacked Ron with a flock of birds which "pecked and clawed at every bit of flesh they could reach" because he kissed Lavender -- both *vicious* and *petty*.

Throughout third year, refused to believe Ron when he said Crookshanks was trying to get Scabbers (which he was) and doubled down on the denial when all the evidence pointed towards Crookshanks killing Scabbers -- uh, sort of petty, more jaw-dropping at how much Hermione wants to be right, that she would deny how her cat behaves around her best friend's pet.

What were you saying about her not being vicious and petty? Don't get me wrong, I don't blame her for a few of these, but there's no denying she has a violent streak in her, especially when she attacked Ron with those birds.
