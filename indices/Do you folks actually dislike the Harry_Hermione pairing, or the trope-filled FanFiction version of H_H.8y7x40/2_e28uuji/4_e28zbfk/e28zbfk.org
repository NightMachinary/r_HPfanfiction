  So it bothers me when people say it was obvious in the books until the end that he was going to end up with her, and that they felt cheated by JKR for not giving them their "obviously canon" ship

I never thought it was an "obvious" ship, I just thought at the time of DH it was the most likely, but for indirect reasons. Namely how badly the romance was written in HBP. I don't care who one ships, but that book was bad in this department. I don't think I need to say more than "monster in his [Harry's] chest".

Anyway, I think JKR's thoughts on this ship more or less match mine:

  In some ways Hermione and Harry are a better fit and I'll tell you something very strange. When I wrote Hallows, I felt this quite strongly when I had Hermione and Harry together in the tent! I hadn't told [Steve] Kloves that and when he wrote the script he felt exactly the same thing at exactly the same point.

  Show me one that has a good length and grammar and plot etc, doesn't bash characters (Ron and Dumbledore especially), and doesn't have muggle-wanking, and I'd love to give it a shot.

linkffn(The Augurey) linkffn(Hermione Granger is Stupid)

Mostly fit that, with a few exceptions here and there (HG is Stupid starts out a bit forced, and Harry saying "I'm doing this for you" felt silly). No bashing though from what I recall. They're pretty in-character.
