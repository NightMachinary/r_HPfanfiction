So just to establish this from the get go, I actually REALLY enjoy the Augury. It might be one of the most well written H/Hr fics period (unfortunately this isn't as high of praise as it seems; we all seem aware in this thread that the writing for this pairing is abysmal even though the ship has been around forever). THAT BEING SAID, this fic still features a Hermione that has "Holier than thou" type attitude which can be extremely off putting. That being said, it also captures her personality perfectly. That's just who Hermione is, she's head strong and is stubborn as all can be. Even though the Augury is one of my favorite H/Hr fics, it really does a good job conveying a lot of the potential pitfalls in Harry and hermione cohabitating with each other from a personality perspective which is often glossed over by other writers
