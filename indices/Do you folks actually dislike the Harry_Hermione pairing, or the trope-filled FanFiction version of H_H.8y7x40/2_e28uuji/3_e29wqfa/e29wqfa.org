  In the books we see Harry get crushes on both Cho and Ginny. They weren't hidden from us, as we read the books from Harry's perspective. We know how he's feeling. We've never seen him think about Hermione in any other way other than as a best friend, not even at the Yule Ball when he was more surprised by Hermione actually being pretty than anything else.

What is the point of this literary analysis? H/Hr fics aren't about "Was Harry secretly in love with Hermione all along?". JKR claims she had her stupid pairings in mind from the beginning and therefore obviously didn't drop any secret hints that Harry might pine after Hermione, because that wasn't in the plan. We're talking about fanfiction here. Or do you only consider fanfiction with canon pairings to be valid (which for me is the worst)?

I feel like you are arguing with shippers who were still hopeful for a H/Hr outcome after HBP - even though it was blatantly obvious that it wasn't going to happen. That ship has sailed long ago...

  So it bothers me when people say it was obvious in the books until the end that he was going to end up with her
#+end_quote

Well it's certainly more obvious to me than any of the main pairings we got in canon. Okay since we've all been here for a while we know all the arguments for or against Ron/Hermione, but to me (and many many other people who prefer HHr), H/Hr is about a million times more obvious than Ron/Hermione, who are as incompatible as oil and water.

So we can at least agree that nothing seems to be obvious in regards to these pairings, when looking at all those widely separated opinions. And if some people believe that the intended, foreshadowed pairings are terrible and the opposite of "should be" I would wager the guess that an unintended (and therefore non-explicitly obvious in the text) pairing might seem more appealing.

#+begin_quote
  Their reasoning is absurd and built on this fantasy perfect relationship between Harry and Hermione.
#+end_quote

It's fiction. People constantly complain about angst on this subreddit and I usually agree. I don't want to see a terrible couple settle for each other because of reasons. Especially when it isn't even realistically portrayed and they don't have constant angst + codependency and never need relationships counseling.

#+begin_quote
  I've just never seen it done well
#+end_quote

Well and I've never seen R/Hr seen done well. And that includes canon. So... there... I guess?

  And lastly, but most importantly, she's not Emma Watson. She actively has to try and spend hours to look incredibly attractive.
#+end_quote

Yeah sure, Emma Watson turned out to be extraordinarily pretty, but this backlash in the opposite direction, implying that Hermione is supposed to be some kind of ugly duckling (because she has bushy hair and buck teeth) is utterly ridiculous and counter-indicated by canon.

Edit: I forgot one thing:

#+begin_quote
  and sometimes opposites attract.
#+end_quote

It really irks me is when Romione shippers defend their ship with: "But opposites attract! They complement each other!". No, that's not how complementary relationships work. Here's a typical example for complementary attributes:

One person likes to talk, the other likes to listen.

Wonderful!

But Ron and Hermione both like to talk. They just like to talk about entirely different things and both kinda hate each other's favorite subjects. Another example:

One likes to cook, the other likes to eat.

Great!

Yeah, except that, Ron likes to eat and Hermione? Not really that much into cooking and not a fan of Ron's table manners either. I can totally see them living together in a flat and Ron wanting to have a big meal while Hermione just wants to order take-out, because she doesn't want to waste time. We can do this all day: Hermione likes to lecture people about perceived wrongs. Ron *HATES* that more than anything. He wants to just forget it and move on. Ron like's irresponsible fun and frivulous spending. Hermione *HATES* that. Hermione wants to finish all her work early, so that she can have free time later, Ron wants to do it as late as possible (I sympathize, me too). These are not complementary attributes, they are opposites and opposites don't attract, they repell.
