  Harry is an impassioned man of action and Hermione is the strategic planner. That works because both traits would naturally complement each other.

Right. He'd be perfectly fine with Hermione planning all the menial details of their lives. Also he's not so fond of the spotlight and wouldn't be totally jealous if Hermione made a big political career. Him being referenced as the husband of Hermione Granger-Potter instead of his own hyphenated moniker would make him ecstatic. With his sense of family he'd be totally fine being the "homemaker" husband, caring for the kids and maybe running a small and exclusive wand-maker business from his hobby shop or tutoring Hogwarts graduates and young Aurors in DADA.
