I agree about the opposites attract thing. It's not a very mature way to look at a relationship. Hermione is an ambitious go-getter and Ron is not. Maybe that would be fine if Ron ever showed a single shred of respect and understanding towards many of the things Hermione valued. It was always just, "can't she give it a rest and why does she care?." It's not a detriment to Ron, I just don't think they really would have the same outlook on life in their adulthood.

For me opposites attract only works if the traits complement each other. Harry is an impassioned man of action and Hermione is the strategic planner. That works because both traits would naturally complement each other.
