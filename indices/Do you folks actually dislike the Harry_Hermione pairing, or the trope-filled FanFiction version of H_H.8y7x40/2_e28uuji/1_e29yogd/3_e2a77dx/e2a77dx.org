This was so articulated so well. All the depth and development of OotP was essentially disregarded in HBP. I agree that it was such a drastic shift in tone that it didn't really feel like part of the same series honestly.

And yes OotP developed Harry and Hermione's relationship so well that before the next book, it wasn't completely out of the question that maybe it could still happen. They were odds with each other a lot but it was more "marriage of the minds" type strategic sparring instead of incompatibility. They both had the same objective and same goals but didn't agree on a lot of the execution, which is normal. They worked well together and their strengths made up for the other's weaknesses. My favorite moment of between of them was when they were arguing about what to do about his vision about Sirius. Everyone else just watched the two of them have this argument in the heat of the calamity and nobody else could articulate what should be done. Nobody else was on their level.

And then in the thick of Harry's mad irrationationality, he finds himself recognizing her "solidarity" that she would join him if he just agreed to check Grimmauld Place first. In the blindness of his anger he was able to step back and realize that she may have a point and she is on his side. He also finds himself "disarmed" in the same scene that she had at one point memorized his words like one of her text books. These shared passions, mutual understandings, mutual admiration and respect is what made me a Harry/Hermione shipper in cannon.
