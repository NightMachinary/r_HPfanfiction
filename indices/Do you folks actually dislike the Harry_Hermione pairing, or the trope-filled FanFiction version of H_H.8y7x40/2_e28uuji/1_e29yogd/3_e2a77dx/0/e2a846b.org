In my mind the main reason for the dramatic shift in tone from OotP to HBP was how JKR had been writing the series.

When JKR first came up with the idea she started making copious notes and outlines. By her own admission though, the */very first thing she wrote narratively/* was the epilogue. It's one of the reasons the epilogue is so cringe worthy.

Props to her for knowing where she wanted to go with it and end up, a lot of authors don't.

She knew the main plot elements of the books before writing it all out, however JKR's real talent always was and always will be character-driven stories. For the first five books, it seems obvious to me that she was hitting all the plot points she needed to, but inbetween the plot how she handled the characters was much more "what works best" and "what would this character do or say right now".

But she finished OotP, looked at all that she had written, and had a moment where she realized that she was now getting rather far from the epilogue she had written in the mid 90s. The characters had taken on a life of their own and they didn't /want/ to fit the ending place she was headed. (Not just in pairings, in other ways also.)

She could, of course, have thrown the epilogue away at that moment. But instead she decided that she needed to "correct" the direction things were headed in. It's why HBP is so ham-fisted. She was for the first time really /forcing/ characters that she had been mostly giving freedom to in the previous 5 books.

Several years after the series was complete, JKR was interviewed (by Emma Watson no less), and was asked about Harry/Hermione. She admitted in that interview that looking back on it now, she thinks that Harry/Hermione would have been better, but she had been so set on what she wanted to do at the time.

I don't really have a problem with Ron or with the Ron/Hermione ship to be honest. I am /confused/ about why Hermione ever really liked Ron in that way, but then we don't see into their inner monologues the way that we do Harry's.

But to me, Ron/Hermione will always be the lazy choice, and Harry/Hermione the right one. Writing Harry/Hermione isn't /easy/. Look at all the complaints about common tropes in those stories in this thread. But writing Ron/Hermione is extremely lazy. It boils down to fiat. "They are just together, that's just what happens".

Harry/Hermione stories sometimes fail to give a good justification for the emotions expressed by the characters, but most Ron/Hermione stories don't bother with a justification /at all/. Which is absurd. I could have been happy with Ron/Hermione being canon even though I preferred Harry/Hermione if I had been given any kind of explanation for why Hermione liked him.

But it was never given.

The Ron/Hermione pairing is in my opinion the product and expression of laziness, and really there's a certain irony to that considering how much Hermione hates laziness.

EDIT:

And the shipping wars continue. How dare I express a different opinion, right? Just downvote and move on. I've been having this kind of discussion with other HP fans for 17 years now, I assure you I give zero fucks about your downvotes.
