" if I had been given any kind of explanation for why Hermione liked him. " actually....there was an explanation. In the Last Book and it lead to their First Kiss. Rons thinking about other Creatures. But its never stated if he "cared" about the House-elfs because he wanted to support Hermione in her SPew doing or because they indeed arent a Warrior Race, like centaurs. But this statement was enough for Hermione to Kiss him.

Some People say, that Ron matured when he returned to Harry and Hermione, but if that had been true, the Locket wouldnt have made him shivering all over. During the Time he was free of its influence he would have thought "My actions were all trash and because of that damn thing. I wouldnt wonder if they really grow fond of each other untill i see them again. I should make peace with the image of her with him". Rons statement "In War and Love everything is allowed, and this is something of both", he really seems to believe that he is still threatened by Harry (or any other male, but Harry in particular), despite his earlier "she is like a sister to me, i thought you know" statement.
