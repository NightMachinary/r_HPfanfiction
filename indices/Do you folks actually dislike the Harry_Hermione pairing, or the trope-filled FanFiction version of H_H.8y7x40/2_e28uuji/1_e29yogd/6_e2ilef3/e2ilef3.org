interesting. the new Joy about Harry/Hermione was one of the reasons, why i was interested in the media for almost after a century. After after finishing the Books i wanted (and still do) read Fics that contain the Pair but stay as close as Canon as possible (i cant stand them or one of them become an animagus, because it 1. seems senseless and 2. would take more time for education than the Canon would last). Do you have some Fics to offer? you can send a PM to avoid filling this Thread with "trash" (in the sense of off-topic and "request" ask)

Oh and yeah, while we see Harry thoughts and learn that he finds Ginny and Cho attractive, we dont see this concerning Hermione. But their Chemistry is more emotional, than "material". One of the Reasons Harry/Luna exist is because she was the only one who could comfort Harry after Sirius death and for this i gave her a Point, but it doesnt make me think that she and him would be a Pair.

What angers me is that Harry seems to think in Book 6, that he is the master of Romantic Relationships (underlined by the "monster in the chest" thing, urgh....), after his failed attraction of Cho (he only saw her stunning attraction, but not her personality and character as he witnessed after Umbridge performed a "Crackdown" on the DA) he absolutely know that Ginny is the one...the one with who he wants to live his whole life. The only obstacle: she is rons sister.
