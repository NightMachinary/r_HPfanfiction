Great post! Indeed, "Hermione's not Emma Watson, she's not pretty, Harry wouldn't be attracted to her" is bullshit. Sexist bullshit, even. You don't need to be Emma Watson to be pretty - or to be attractive to boys and men. Not everyone and certainly not every boy thinks only movie stars are good enough to date.

And love isn't rational. You don't decide logically who you'll fall in love with. Love happens.
