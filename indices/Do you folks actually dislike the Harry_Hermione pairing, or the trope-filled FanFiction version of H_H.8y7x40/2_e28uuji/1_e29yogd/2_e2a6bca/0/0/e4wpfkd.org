Just found this comment chain (must have missed it), sorry for being late to the party (your long comment above was brilliant by the way... and your fics are too)

  Well... Harry was rather shallow. That's why he ended up with Ginny.

Another example of the laziness you mentioned. Harry should really have discovered other reasons why he wants to be with Ginny besides her being convenient, pretty, sporty and "fun". The Harry we see in the books is a pretty damaged boy, with no real childhood or sense of self-worth trying to distract himself with relationships to girls. He never gets to grow out of that, which is a shame and we're supposed to believe that it wouldn't all come crashing down when he realizes how he got to be with Ginny.
