Well... Harry was rather shallow. That's /why/ he ended up with Ginny. The problem with getting Harry and Hermione together in a story, if you're working with canon, isn't Hermione being ugly, it's that Harry doesn't (seem) to care how interesting of a person a girl is as long as they're pretty. At least going off of HBP.

If you remove that book's characterization of Harry and keep his "definitive" personality to 1-5 + 7, he doesn't come off quite as much of a boy who only chases a pretty face.
