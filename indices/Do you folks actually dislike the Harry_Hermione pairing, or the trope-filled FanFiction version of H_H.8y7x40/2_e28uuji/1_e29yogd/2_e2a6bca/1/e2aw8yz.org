I never said that Harry couldn't be attracted to her because she's not pretty. If I did, please show me where. In fact, I literally pointed out that Harry was more surprised that Hermione could be pretty than actually caring that she was pretty.

When I said Hermione wasn't Emma Watson, that was following a line of thought which was "Hermione isn't perfect, she isn't supposed to be perfect, and that's a good thing." Her attractiveness falls within this. When you, in your stories, make her out to be beautiful without trying (recall that it took 3 hours of work /with/ magic to make herself look stunning), you are implying that she has to be beautiful in order for Harry to fall in love with her.

This is, of course, incredibly sexist. Doubly so, because canon Hermione doesn't give a rat's ass about her appearance like society dictates she must. She looks presentable, and that's good enough for her. She is comfortable with her body, even if she isn't classically beautiful like you and other sexist fanfic authors like yourself make her out to be.
