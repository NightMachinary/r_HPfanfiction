See, I think this is where your bias comes in. People were staring at her in disbelief not because she went from pretty --> stunning but because she went from average and plain --> stunning.

No one is in disbelief when a pretty girl goes to a dance all made up and looking better than ever. That's rather standard. Everyone is surprised when the resident bookworm who just recently had buckteeth (which isn't flattering on ANYONE) comes out to the dance looking stunning as all hell.

And if her buckteeth were big, then she actually might have been considered ugly before she got them reduced.
