My goodness I realize this comment is about a month old but as someone who was around HP fandom since 2000, lived through all of this drama and was on the receiving end of a lot of that H/Hr shipper hate, this post almost gave me PTSD with how much it relived all that time hahahaha

It was crazy! And it's funny to me that people now either have no idea how intense it was, or have very little regard for how fractions the fandom was. Y'all also have to keep in mind that the internet was not what it is now. Back then those websites were the most intense, populated ones when it came to HP. Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook were not a thing, not even Livejournal was around! That's why when the fandom fractioned in half, H/Hr shippers were literally cast off.

But like you said, that's some history that few people still care about enough to remember.
