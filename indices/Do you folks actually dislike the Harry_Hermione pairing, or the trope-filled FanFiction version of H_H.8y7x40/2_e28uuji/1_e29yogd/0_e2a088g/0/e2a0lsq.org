It's actually kind of funny and absurd. The guy who owned Mugglenet at the time, Emerson Spartz, was a complete and utter tool and asshole.

The depictions of Ron being a dick and an abuser and all of that didn't originate out of his "bad table manners" or the movie depictions of Ron.

They originated in H/Hr fans being justifiably pissed at Emerson and casting /him/ as Ron in their fanfics. That depiction of Ron had already been turned into a trope by the time the movies started fucking up Ron's character by giving his best lines to Hermione.
