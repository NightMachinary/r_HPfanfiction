I wonder how many of the people here were actually reading the books as they came out?

A large reason that the Ron/Hermione and Harry/Hermione ships still have such acrimony is because of how JKR /and/ fans handled the two years between /Order of the Phoenix/ and /Half Blood Prince/.

Obviously, canon ships weren't completely obvious until HBP. After OotP was released, the ship-wars between fans got particularly vicious. The largest fansite at that time was Mugglenet, and the second largest was The Leaky Cauldron, both of which were run exclusively by Ron/Hermione fans. They purposely fostered a hostile environment over a disagreement that is truly a matter of taste, not one of dogma.

This wasn't helped at all by the fact that OotP set up a situation in which you could easily "turn left" and dive directly into H/Hr very easily. Hermione had been the only one to believe Harry immediately in /Goblet/, and then in OotP followed that up by basically breaking every rule she had to in order to make sure Harry was okay.

She organized the DA to learn defense, but also to give Harry confidence and something to focus on besides Umbridge to try and keep him out of trouble. She canceled her Christmas vacation and was the only character who was actually able to pull Harry out of his self-loathing at Grimmauld Place over the attack on Arthur. She /purposely led a teacher into a situation that could easily kill the teacher making her guilty of at least manslaughter/. She followed Harry to the Ministry despite the fact that she was still obviously completely certain it was a trap.

The books could have very easily "turned left" after OotP and given some very good justifications for Harry finally being interested in Hermione romantically.

However, HBP was such a DRAMATIC shift in tone from OotP that it felt, at least to me, like /it/ was more of a left turn. OotP was dark, and it was gritty, and it was emotional. It had powerful moments of characterization and emotion, and it showed incredible depth to many characters in the books.

HBP simplified a lot of things. Sure, it's teenage romance which isn't exactly suave, but the descriptions of Harry's "feelings" were gag inducing. (Christ, please keep the dragon inside Harry.) After the incredible depth and emotion of OotP, HBP which started only a few weeks after Sirius' death showed Harry essentially shrugging it off. He had none of the expected inner turmoil over losing Sirius that people expected, and the only real inner emotions the book went into was the awfully written romance between him and Ginny.

It also kind of dulled what was supposed to be the emotional fulcrum of the whole series: Dumbledore's death. The rest of the book had been so childish and annoying that reading the last few chapters it just didn't feel like I was actually invested in the story in the same way. I read Dumbledore's death in a much more detached way than I did Sirius', and basically thought "Oh, well I suppose that will make Book 7 a bit different."

JKR didn't take any time to give Ginny the proper depth either. She essentially played the part of the uterus for the stories. If JKR had wanted to make that work better, some of the roles she gave to Hermione she should have given to Ginny, like the Christmas scene in OotP. In fact, after Hermione cancels her vacation and makes sure Harry is okay, Ginny basically tells Harry, "hey, I'm one of the only people in the world that can uniquely relate to your fears of being possessed by Voldemort, and I wanted to explain this to you all along, but I was annoyed that you were being broody and ignoring me".

Like... seriously?

As you can tell, there were some serious reasons beyond "I prefer the other girl" that Harry/Hermione fans were disappointed with HBP. What happened after though (because HBP didn't EXPLICITLY state what the ending ships were) is that Mugglenet and TLC scored a joint interview with JKR herself shortly after the book was released. They asked her point blank about Ron/Hermione, JKR confirmed that Ron/Hermione was canon to them, and then they proceeded to /ban anyone on the fansites who discussed non-canon pairings/.

That fractured the fan community quite heavily. Fanfic authors of H/Hr fics migrated almost completely to portkey.org because of this, and the two groups perceptions of tropes, and which fics and ideas they were exposed to, got almost completely separated.

That's why you have such a distinct corner of fandom now that writes these monstrously over the top "evil dumbledore, evil weasleys" fics. The fandom was forced apart because the people that ran Mugglenet and TLC were smug assholes who wanted to gloat about "being right", and so all the people who would have looked at that trope early on and gone "wtf is this bullshit" weren't around to call it what it was: an annoying and formulaic trope that makes the story much worse.

There are /plenty/ of good H/Hr fics out there, and plenty that don't dive into the whole "fuck Ron, fuck Dumbledore, Hermione is Emma Watson" thing. Those stories tend to focus on the more emotional connection between Harry and Hermione that seemed to be present in Book 5 than on Hermione being pretty. (Although, regardless of looks you would expect Harry to find Hermione attractive if he was attracted to her. Eye of the beholder and all that.)

But it's 2018 now, and a significant part of the people who are still in the fandom weren't alive/reading the books when they were first coming out. The historical reasons for the fucked up situation with ships in HP fandom is mostly lost to the annals of a history that few people remember or care about.

EDIT:

And for the record, the Emma Watson made the H/Hr ship happen idea is complete bullshit. The H/Hr ship really started to gain some steam after the ride to save Sirius at the end of PoA, which was before the movies had even been announced as a thing. Additionally, even after the movies came out, Ron/Hermione was always the ship which had more fans in the fandom, despite whatever effect Emma Watson may have had.

EDIT 2:

None of this was helped by the fact that prior to HBP being released, JKR had stated in an interview that she originally modeled Ron after her ex-husband, and Hermione after herself.

EDIT 3:

JKR in 2014

  [I] wrote the Hermione-Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfilment ... for reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron

Those reasons were what I detailed here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8y7x40/do_you_folks_actually_dislike_the_harryhermione/e2a846b/]]

I didn't pull this rant out of my ass people, this isn't even as much opinion as you think it is. JKR definitively fucked up canon pairings, even in her own mind.

She's /allowed/ to make mistakes like that, the series is still absolutely amazing! Romance is such a small and unimportant part of the series as written. But that's why it makes so little sense for /anyone/ to shit on someones favorite pairing.

I've been in this fandom since 1999 when PoA was released and waited in line for GoF on release day in 2000 (because that was actually a thing back in those days). I've been having fandom discussions with other people on the internet since 2001 which is three years before GMail existed.

That doesn't make my opinions more important, but it does mean that I have a lot more things to draw on to make these arguments than most and I also have probably been thinking about them longer.

If anyone is interested or has a question, I can probably answer more questions about HP fandom history.
