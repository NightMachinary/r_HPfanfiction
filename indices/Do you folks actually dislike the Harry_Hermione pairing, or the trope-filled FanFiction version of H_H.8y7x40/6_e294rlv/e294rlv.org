I don't dislike the pairing if its written well. That's the point, it has to be well written and make sense before I can jump on board with it. I've read some fics where they get together just cause. Yet I've read a lot more where they have a soul-bond, are super geniuses, Ron is a ass, etc. etc. Not saying those fics can't be good but it gets tiresome.
