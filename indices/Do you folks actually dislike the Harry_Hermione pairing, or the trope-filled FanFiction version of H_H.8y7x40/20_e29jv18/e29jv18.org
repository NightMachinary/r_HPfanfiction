I really only dislike the pairing because its (usually) one of three things:

1. The whole “Hermione-is-greatest-witch-evar” has ruined her character for me.

2. It's usually really forced. Like, for example, i was reading this fic and after Harry met Hermione it was pretty much just Hermione and Harry's relationship and nothing else.

3. A fic may be Hermione centric, and i almost never read one that's not Harry centric.

More often than not, its a mix of 1 and 2.
