I think in the first instance you're talking about the ship itself, while in the second you are talking about the "ship base". I dislike H/H in canon because they do not fit together romantically. I dislike H/H in fanon partly because of the Ginny and Ron bashing, which in turn seeps into the arguments made to argue for H/H in canon.
