The scene in canon which "Love Potion" fantasists use to justify Ginny using Love Potion on Harry is when Molly in /PoA/ tells of the Potion that she had made during her Hogwarts years, and Ginny /and/ Hermione are said to be giggling over it. As well as Ginny /and/ Hermione standing over love potions in WWW during /HBP/, and Ginny is said to have a "sceptical" reaction, and both Ginny and Hermione "hung back, looking wary".

Makes one wonder why there are far less LovePotion!Hermione stories, compared with LovePotion!Ginny... or not.
