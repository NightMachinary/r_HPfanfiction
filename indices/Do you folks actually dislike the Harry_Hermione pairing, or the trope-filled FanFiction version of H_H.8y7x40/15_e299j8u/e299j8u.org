I do dislike H/Hr. To me they're siblings and Harry frequently speaks as if he's bored when they two of them are alone. He never finds her pretty or beautiful (except at the Yule Ball, where he's /surprised/), and they don't have any chemistry.

I don't think I have the right to say I dislike the trope-filled fanfics as I've never willingly read H/Hr. I can't stand Ron and Ginny bashing which is apparently very common in these? And I'm not interested in politics/inheritance fics either so based on this thread I'd probably hate the fanfic version.
