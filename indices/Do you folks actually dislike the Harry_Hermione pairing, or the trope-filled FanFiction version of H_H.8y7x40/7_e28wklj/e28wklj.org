I dislike both. I dislike Hermione, not because she's a bad person or anything of the sort, I just find her obnoxious. Canon Hermione is intrusive, demanding and loud. Harry describes her as shrill at times. Sometime there are things about people you dislike. I dislike intrusive people, a lot of people dislike arrogance, I find that amusing so its probably just me. With that in mind I've always been able to get behind Harry, he tolerates Hermione and she tolerates his moody git tenancies. Ron always seemed the most laid back and so it made sense he could flex and bend around Hermione's relative inflexibility. Harry and Hermione is two people who are too intense as far as I am concerned. I also dislike reading it because I want to get behind Harry and I find Hermione's presence annoying. An important bit of story telling is making you be sympathetic to the protagonist, a major issue for a lot of dark Harry stories. I lose all sympathy for a Harry that gets paired with Hermione. The tropey version is even worse.
