Whilst I really like Hermione I've never seen her as a romantic interest of Harry. There is not a single passage in the books that would hint at this. She's more like Harry's big sister, who takes care that he does his homework and helps him when he has problems.\\
Although the two of them are good friends in the books, Hermione never laughs at Harry's jokes. Only Ron can make her laugh...if they don't actually bicker. Besides, I can't imagine Hermione in a romantic situation, she's kind of asexual to me. Maybe I see her through Harry's eyes, lol.

Maybe it's the reason I never read an H/Hr story. It's too OOC for both. Well, this is the reason I can't say much about your second point.
