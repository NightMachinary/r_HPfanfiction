I don't think Rowling was on some sort of mission to prove a purely platonic friendship between a man and a woman in literature. The heightened "noble" ideal of this is something fans have projected onto Harry and Hermione's relationship, not something that Rowling sought out to do. So I think it's a little unfair to say that undermined their relationship with that comment. I think she just planned that Ron and Hermione would end up and Harry and Ginny would also end up, and it's really as simple as that. Upon further reflection she considered that indeed, they may have made a better fit. She's completely within her own rights to do this.

She has also said that guys like Ron are fun to date but not so fun to marry. She said that she was in a relationship with a Ron like character where she was herself a Hermione. Very serious and studious, and he was less serious and made her laugh. Unfortunately the relationship didn't work out, and she said that she ended up with a Harry. I think that gives some context to those statement and should show people that it wasn't really out of the blue.
