I agree that she didn't have a specific goal with their relationship to above all else show that a platonic relationship is possible. I'm merely saying it was one aspect of their relationship that she pushed. And regardless of whether it was a deliberate attempt, the fact does remain that it was how it was set up. For Rowling to then imply it was possibly more simply has no basis in canon. And is a (potential) shame because a lot of readers, myself included, appreciated the nature of Harry and Hermione's friendship. That a boy and a girl can form an incredibly close bond without it needing to be romantic. It also has implications for their future relationships with their respective partners, who both operate under the belief that Harry and Hermione are purely platonic, like siblings, when in fact they are not. I fully admit I'm taking this way beyond what Rowling was probably intending but am just trying to illustrate the actual impact of such a statement. Of course, it really doesn't mean anything and to be honest, I never even really thought about this until I responded to that initial comment. Fun!

  I think she just planned that Ron and Hermione would end up and Harry and Ginny would also end up, and it's really as simple as that. Upon further reflection she considered that indeed, they may have made a better fit.

I don't want to put words in your mouth, but given that there is still a lot of confusion over that interview, when you say this, are you saying that Rowling believes H/Hr was a better fit than R/Hr or a better fit than both R/Hr and H/G?
