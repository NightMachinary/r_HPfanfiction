If people feel let down because they viewed Harry and Hermione's relationship to be purely platonic, that's not really JKR's fault. A lot of authors claim to lose control over their characters a bit once they put them on the page. She's well within her rights to claim that a moment ended up different than what she previously thought possible. Also, from what JKR seemed to imply its really just two friends who had a potentially charged moment after having an intense experience together. She's a girl and he's a guy. It's possible and I'm sure it's happened to many real life friends. That one moment doesn't mean that they can't be platonic anymore, especially since neither of them took it any further. Relationships aren't ever so cut and dry in either platonic or non-platonic categories. It's a spectrum. Harry and Hermione are not siblings despite claiming that they feel that way, so it's not out of the question to have a moment like that.

As far as the interview guys, I am saying Rowling admitted that in some ways Harry and Hermione are a better fit than Ron and Hermione. I don't believe she mentioned Ginny.
