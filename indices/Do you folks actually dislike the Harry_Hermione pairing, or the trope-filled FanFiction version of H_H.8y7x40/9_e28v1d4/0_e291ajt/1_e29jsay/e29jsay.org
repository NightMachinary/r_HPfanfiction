I always found this quote a bit unsettling because it makes it appear that Rowling didn't actually know her own characters that well and/or she basically undermined a great friendship and the noble idea that a man and woman can be great platonic friends.

To suggest it could have gone that way flies in the face of everything we have learned in that actual text about the nature of Harry, Hermione and their relationship. They never showed any romantic interest in each other, for one. And more importantly, both have enough moral fortitude to never even consider doing that to Ron and Ginny.

I hope that what Rowling really meant was that for many people in the same situation as them, something could have happened. But Harry and Hermione are moral people and have always just been tremendous friends so it never truly was a path they would take.
