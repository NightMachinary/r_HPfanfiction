Very fair. And reading that back I don't like how absolute I sounded.

It is indeed common for people to start out as platonic friends and then change. And it's common for two people to date but realize they aren't actually into each other romantically but vibe well as friends. I would argue that once that line is crossed either way (from friend to lover or lover to friend) it's nearly impossible to go back.

My point is that Rowling set up over the course of 6 1/2 books a certain dynamic that Harry and Hermione were simply not attracted to each other and had a very sibling-like relationship, especially from Hermione's side. For Rowling to suggest that they could be more felt like undermining all that development and also going against what I feel is a very positive message about opposite sexes being able to be friends. But that's just my view.
