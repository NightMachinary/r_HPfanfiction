  Purely platonic friends don't have that desire or draw to pursue a romantic relationship with each other.

You and I have had very different life experiences. For one thing, there's absolutely a time element--you can be purely platonic friends at certain points in your relationship and at other points be teetering on the edge of romance. It can even evolve from "almost romance" to "totally platonic". From what I can tell, it's sort of like a less-extreme version of falling out of love.
