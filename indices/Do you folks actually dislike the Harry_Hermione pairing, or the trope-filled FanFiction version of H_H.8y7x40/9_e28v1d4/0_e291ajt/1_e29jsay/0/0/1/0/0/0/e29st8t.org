Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't the "for personal reasons not because it was credible to her", refer to Hermione being with Ron, not that being with Harry was actually the more credible choice? Just that Hermione and Ron winding up together was more personal rather than objectively credible?

Overall, fair enough. We just see this differently. For what it's worth, I don't actually think they were ever close to hooking up from what was written. I actually think you're right, that it's just the situation (which is quite the common cliche in fiction) which got her mind going in that direction.

But could you imagine the fallout from actually writing it? How does Ron stay friends with them? Same with Ginny and the rest of the Weasleys?
