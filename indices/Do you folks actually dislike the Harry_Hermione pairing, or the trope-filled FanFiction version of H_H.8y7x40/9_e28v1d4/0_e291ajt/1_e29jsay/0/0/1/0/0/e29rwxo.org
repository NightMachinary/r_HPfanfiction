Yea, /after/ friends do that sort of thing it's not platonic. But that's the point. No one is immutable in the way you seem to think they should be, not even platonic friends. People don't get to choose who they're attracted to and when it happens.

It proves Rowling decided to leave them that way, yes. But not because going further was unthinkable but, in her own words, "for personal reasons not because it was credible to her", going further to say it was what she planned from the beginning so she in hindsight thinks it was stubbornness on her part.

It's hard to say which she meant. Either is believable, that they were close to hooking up or simply that she was close to writing that. For me, I'm just saying I don't personally see it as an issue.
