I don't really get this. It wasn't like it was set up as a law of sorts that "I, Harry, am only and forever unattracted to my best friend." The point is just that it's very plausible things could have gone differently, especially when they were alone for, what, a few months? It's not even that there's was a substantial sexual draw between them (although I'd argue being alone in a tent for a long time with a girl of the same age isn't likely to prevent less than innocent thoughts from the mind).

I mean, I guess I'm just confused because while Rowling settled on a strong platonic friendship, that's after Ron comes back. They were just friends before, but I'll repeat, people have hooked up throughout time (yes, even those who intended to remain friends) in far less stressful situations and between friends that were nowhere near as close as Harry and Hermione were.
