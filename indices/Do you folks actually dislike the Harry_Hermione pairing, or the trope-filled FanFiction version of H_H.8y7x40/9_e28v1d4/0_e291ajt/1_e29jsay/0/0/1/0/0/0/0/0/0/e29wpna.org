I don't think that's the case. In many ways, Ron's fear there felt forced because there was never a time we were told he thought they were together or might be heading that way. He and Hermione weren't friends because they were attracted to each other so I don't think, even if it happened, they would forever be split. That, I think, would be do a disservice to the friendship they'd built between the three of them.
