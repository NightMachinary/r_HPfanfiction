You don't think it would've destroyed Harry and Hermione's relationship with at least Ron and Ginny?

Yes, Harry and Ginny were on a break but the kiss on his birthday showed that they clearly still cared for/loved each other. Plus Hermione and Ginny were great friends and Hermione basically coached Ginny on how to get Harry and was one of their biggest supporters. It would've been a tremendous stab in the back to Ginny for Hermione to hook up with Harry, break up or not. I don't think she physically attacks anyone, but I would imagine her friendship with both is over.

Ron's biggest insecurity and fear, as demonstrated when the locket Horcrux opens, is Hermione picking Harry over him. Ron is also a very jealous man and I can't possibly imagine him being ok with Harry and Hermione dating. He couldn't deal with them coming over for Sunday lunches at the Burrow. The entire relationship with the Trio, the thing the entire story is anchored to for 7 books, would be utterly destroyed in that moment.

This is why I don't think Rowling was actually ever considering it. I think he felt the pull as we both sorta described just from the situation being what it was. But doing so would fly in the face of 6 1/2 books of character development.
