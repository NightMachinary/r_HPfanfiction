But then those friendships aren't platonic anymore, are they? And I guess that's my point, that for Rowling to say their was a romantic pull between Harry and Hermione in that moment and it could've happened undermines the idea they are completely platonic. This is simply my opinion.

I suppose I can concede that perhaps this pull was simply in Rowling's head based entirely on the situation. But the fact that it didn't happen, nor was it even a thought in Harry's brain, does prove that ultimately Rowling did view them as completely platonic.

Perhaps Rowling may have been trying to make a deep point about the pair, but in reality all she is really saying is that when a man and woman who are close find themselves in isolating and dangerous situations, anything can happen. But hopefully she isn't actually saying that the characters canonically were very close to hooking up but just didn't at the last second.
