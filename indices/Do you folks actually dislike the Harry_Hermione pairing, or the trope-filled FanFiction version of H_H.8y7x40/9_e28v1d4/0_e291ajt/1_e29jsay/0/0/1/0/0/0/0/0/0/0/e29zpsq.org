Ron's fear comes from inadequacy that Hermione wouldn't want him when she could have the hero, Harry. But he absolutely wanted Hermione and would be devastated to have his greatest fears confirmed. And it was patently obvious to Harry that Ron liked Hermione a lot. In fact, didn't he see them holding hands during the hunt while they were asleep (maybe that was just the movie). Yes, he was first friends with her and it wasn't because he was attracted to her. But so what? At some point he fell for her. And Harry knew it. And the facr that they were best friends would only make it worse. Plus he'd be mad at Harry for doing that to Ginny too.
