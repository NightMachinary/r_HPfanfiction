  Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't the "for personal reasons not because it was credible to her", refer to Hermione being with Ron, not that being with Harry was actually the more credible choice?

Maybe? I think it's part of the same interview. Might have mixed it up with this quote:

  In some ways Hermione and Harry are a better fit and I'll tell you something very strange. [...]

I honestly don't think the Weasleys would be an issue. Since he'd already broken up with Ginny, I don't think she'd lose her mind with anger the way some write her to do. Upset and angry yes, but not blind with rage and actually attacking Hermione type of rage.

Ron... Hm hard to say for one big reason: DH was a huge regression for Ron's character in my opinion. After GoF, having Ron leave again, at the worst time, just felt so wrong. In a crossover I'm drafting, I decided to use that as a time for Ron to actually grow (as opposed to random unexplained growths we got at the end of DH), realizing how much Hermione was willing to give up when she refused to leave with him.
