My point is that by putting that possibility out there (and I'd argue in a way that implied that it was a genuine possibility) it does undermine the dynamic she wrote, that of two best friends in a purely platonic way. Purely platonic friends don't have that desire or draw to pursue a romantic relationship with each other. She is implying that there was some romantic/sexual draw between Harry and Hermione while on the hunt and perhaps if one made a move, the other would have reciprocated and they would've been together. And I'm arguing that goes against the very canon description of their relationship.

This could just be a difference of opinion as to what constitutes a platonic friendship.

Regarding your last point about there being nothing immortal about them hooking up, I can understand the point but ultimately disagree. But I think that just comes down to a difference of perspective, not something where either of us would be wrong.
