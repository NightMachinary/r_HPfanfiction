I don't really understand your reaction. That she left them as friends shows that it can't possibly undermine the idea men and women can remain just friends. It certainly doesn't show she doesn't understand the characters, that seems an overreaction.

The idea is just that the two had become so close by that point, and in a long term situation where they could only rely on each other for literally everything, that it was feasible that they might take it further. It's not that those situations were romantic, but that they were intended to show how close they were. Most people throughout to hey I me have hooked up over far less. There have been nothing immoral if they had.
