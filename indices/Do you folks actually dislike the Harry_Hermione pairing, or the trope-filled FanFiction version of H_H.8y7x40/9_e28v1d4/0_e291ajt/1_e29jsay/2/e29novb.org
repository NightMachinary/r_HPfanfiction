I mean, JKR has also said that Snape/Lily could have ended up happening, had Snape [[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/07/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript/]["not loved Dark Magic so much, and been drawn to such loathesome people and acts"]]. Hence, either/both Snape/Lily would have had to be OOC in some or many ways. I'm pretty sure that JKR has specific reasons why Harry and Hermione also do not belong together. Otherwise, she would not have said in literally the same conversation that Harry and Ginny are soulmates, nor would she have said that "Harry's love for Ginny is true" literally three days after the Wonderland interview came out.
