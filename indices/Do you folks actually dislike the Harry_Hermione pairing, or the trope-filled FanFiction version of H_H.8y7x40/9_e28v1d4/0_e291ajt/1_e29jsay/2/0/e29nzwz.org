Agreed. It just seems weird how Rowling seems intent on throwing a bone to shippers despite her own writing directly contradicting her comments.

It's as though these comments suggest Rowling doesn't fully understand how attraction and relationships work in the real world, or at least is susceptible to the same unrealistic and often-toxic tropes in fiction.
