Indeed we are. Somehow an author's thoughts about her own story's possible direction was, because you couldn't accept you simply lied about what I said, turned into a game where you pretend this was about literary analysis where you seem to think the school of thought you accept, in virtue of its mere existence, entails you are correct in an unrelated matter. You are a joke. I don't think I'm important online. The issue is that you're not an honest person. Sad reality, but there it is.
