The text is a result of the author's intent. Ignoring it is just idiocy, most especially in this case since it's about A) A hypothetical story JKR might have written and B) About what JKR had on her mind at the time. This is literally irrelevant to literary theory because of that. You are reaching so hard right now it's embarrassing.
