No you dunce, you misrepresented what the point was. Being close friends is not a prelude to romance. But two friends who are closer than most could imagine (OoTP is replete with examples of this, even amidst fighting), aren't in a relationship with others at present, are living together and relying on each other for literally everything... that /is/ a perfectly possible prelude to romance. I thought this sort of went without saying. Those are almost certainly the reasons why JKR conceded they were probably a better fit.
