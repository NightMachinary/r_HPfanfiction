  Because I don't buy into your argument?
#+end_quote

No.because you started off by responding like an asshole and you keep saying this:

#+begin_quote
  Because I don't believe because you put your arm around someone while walking, this could turn into a romance?
#+end_quote

I never said that and the fact you can't read is annoying. I'll just quote, yet again, what my argument is from what I said above:

#+begin_quote
  Being close friends is not a prelude to romance. But two friends who are closer than most could imagine (OoTP is replete with examples of this, even amidst fighting), aren't in a relationship with others at present, are living together and relying on each other for literally everything... that is a perfectly possible prelude to romance.

So no, it's not "putting your arm around someone is a prelude to romance". You are an idiot, try reading. What I said is exactly what Rowling was referring to.
