  .as can be seen Harrys interlude with Myrtle in the prefects bathroom.

That's silly and you know it, Harry very clearly didn't appreciate that. And Myrtle is, you know, a ghost. And the text I quoted explains it aptly. It's an emotionally charged series of moments that can bring people together. Watching a map, while cute (?) Isn't really comparable.

  Sorry, I can't see your point because the text you're refrerencing isn't even in the books.

I honestly can't tell if you're being serious here. That quote was JKR talking /about/ a few moments from the books. I'm going to be charitable and assume you, for some reason, thought I was quoting someone besides the author of the series.
