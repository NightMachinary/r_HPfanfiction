I didn't exactly like eliminating her from the fic, but definitely as a love interest. In A Road not Taken (the one with Harry not getting on the Knight Bus before year 3) for instance, Hermione is kind of a /w/itch to Harry and Ginny. (And Cho Chang is also rather awful.)

Of course, a great portion of Hinny fics are interpolating the final battle and 1 September 2017. Postwar epilogue-compliant fics tend not to be bashifcs (i.e. the worst of the worst)...
