I used to like H/Hr pairings, but after reading so many bashing fics and just reading different POV about several of the issues that Hermione harps on, it just soured her for me. These days, the only type of Hermione I can endure is a veteran or completely different Hermione, like from Stages of Hope. Curiously, I never liked Ron much from Canon, I thought him abandoning during book 7 was horrible. After reading so many bashing fics where they extrapolate Ron's jealousy, I ended up wanting to defend him, and so now I really like when Ron stays as Harry's friend in some fanfics. I particularly liked him in The Sum of our Parts and HP and the Magic of Life. If you haven't read HP and the MoF, Ron has a big argument with Harry over the GoF, but they actually talk and the author manages to convey all of Ron's issues and make him relatable to Harry. It isn't "i want fame and gold and you're trash Harry for not gibe me monies" and Harry goes "I forgive you because reasons" like it is in canon.

Bit of a tangent there, but what can I say, I like Ron.
