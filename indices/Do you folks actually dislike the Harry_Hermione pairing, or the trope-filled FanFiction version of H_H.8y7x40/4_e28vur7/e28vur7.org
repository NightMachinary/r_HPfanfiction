No, the only pairings I dislike is Luna/anyone or Sirius/anyone (unless Sirius is not made out to be the perfect human being, like he constantly is)

What I heavily dislike about harry / Hermione is the massive Weasley bashing. Ron is an amazing dude and he is vastly underappreciated. Ginny is a little ball of fire and is more than just her crush on Harry.
