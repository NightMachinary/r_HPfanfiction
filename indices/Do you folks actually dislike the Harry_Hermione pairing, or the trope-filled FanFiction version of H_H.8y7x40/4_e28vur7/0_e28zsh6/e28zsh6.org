In every Luna pairing they tone down Luna's weirdness immensely, and her talking in riddles and “made-up” (as-far as we know) creatures to convey her emotions and experiences which heavily differentiates her from every other character. Tbh Rolf would be the only good pairing, if he's as eccentric as Newt.
