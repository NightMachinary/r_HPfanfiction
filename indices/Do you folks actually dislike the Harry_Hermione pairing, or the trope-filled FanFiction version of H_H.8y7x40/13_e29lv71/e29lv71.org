I dislike the pairing because it simply doesn't work for an actual relationship. Romantic, long-term compatibility is about who you want to spend the day with just doing nothing. Who shares your interests, who makes you laugh, who are you attracted to. Hermione is like a big sister to Harry. She isn't someone that Harry would choose to hang out with above many other options, but she loves him and has his back like a family member would. And he relies on her tremendously for a certain type of support. But actual romantic relationships are very different from familial relationships (thank god).

My sister is not someone I would get along with as a friend. She's a great person but we have different interests and personalities. But if I ever got seriously hurt, or had a bad breakup, she would be right there for me and be one of the best people to bring me back around. And I'm not discounting the fact that Harry and Hermione are legitimately friends who enjoy each other's company to a degree. But on the spectrum where on one end is your spouse and the other is your brother or sister, Hermione is closer to the sister end.
