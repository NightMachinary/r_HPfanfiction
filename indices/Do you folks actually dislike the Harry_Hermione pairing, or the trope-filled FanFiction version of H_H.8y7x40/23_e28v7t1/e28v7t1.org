I dislike the pairing as a whole, but my opinion of that is coloured by the tropes. I see H/Hr and immediately close a fic most of the time, as i expect awful tropes. Though my least favourite Hermione trope is that "Harry is in love with Hermione, so she always joins in whatever potentially cool pairing there is" ruining it. "Is this a potentially good Harry/Fleur fic? Nope, Chuck Hermione" "Is this an interesting Crossover premise where Harry lands the Crossover girl? Nope, Chuck Hermione" always ending in screwy Tri pairings that end up seeming so forced that you just want to stop reading
