I feel bad for feeling this way, but I just don't like the Harry/Hermione pairing.

I didn't like it prior to reading a lot of fanfiction, and I like it even less now. I feel like they work way better as best friends rather than lovers.

And to be honest, after reading both canon and a lot of fanfiction, I am not a fan of Harry/Ginny as well.
