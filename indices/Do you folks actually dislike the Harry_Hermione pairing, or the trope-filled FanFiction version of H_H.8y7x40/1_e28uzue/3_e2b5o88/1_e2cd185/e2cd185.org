It's an interesting question. Does animagi have the DNA of the species they transfigure into? If they do, and the body is fully functional, they should be able to breed. On the other hand tho, the cygote is a separate being entirely so... Whew, this a hard one

The only canonical information that is similar is that werewolves who breed while transformed will produce true wolves (albeit with highly increased intelligence), but werewolves are distinctly different from animagi.
