Well... First it depends on whether or not sperm/ovum are produced otherwise no breeding will happen period. You see zygote is what we call a fertilized ovum. Now if the animagus transformation is actually a biological transformation than regardless the product will be of the animal species. However, a wizard did it so animagus transformations could just be really complicated msotly corporeal illussions in other words does an animagus bleed? If yes than Babies! If no than Infertility! do you got that morty? this is impiortant now so pay attention morty. Evidence form canon supports the idea of transformations being physical and biological as shown by dementors treating dogmeat!sirius different from manmeat!sirius and the breeding habists of werewolves. Following such animagi would likely produce sperm/eggs if after a menstrual cycle as their species. Further, the specific workings of childbirth likely depend more on Rowling's religios views and views on abortion than any sort of logic and the product again religious and abortion views but with the added factor of the difference between a werewolf and animagus. Now listen cllose morty because I'm running out of shits to give. I'm going to run on the assumption that werewolves are effectively parasites and that animagi are transformations basically into versions of animals with brain space for developed minds and soul space for human souls because magic is a thing and nobody gives a shit about hinduism or buddhism. Allright morty is that cool? No? complain later we have SCIENCE! to do. Now following this assumption the most logical outcome is intelligent and ensouled upgraded animals. However religiona nd abortion are involved so fuck the notion of logic. but I unexpectadly ran out of shits to give so I'll leave you to figure out what kind of stupid ass narnia ass eclipse phase ass crazy shit i was about to pull out of my ass.
