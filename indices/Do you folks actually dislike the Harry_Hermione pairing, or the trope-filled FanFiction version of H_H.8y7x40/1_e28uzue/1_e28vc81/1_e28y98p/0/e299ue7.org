Hmm, I wouldn't go so far as to say "just a ritual" and a potion, like it's repeatedly stressed how difficult it is to accomplish. Uagadou seems to view this sort of magic as its specialty, but there's afaik no reliable information about exactly how common it is, it's also famous for alchemy for example but I doubt that every student is a master of alchemy by default so to speak.

Ragedless, as I stated above my objections are about "natural" animagus transformations, i.e when it "just happens" (usually explained by some contrived "because their bond was so strong", they're Merlin and Morgana incarnate/generally OP and so on). There are good animagi fics by contrast. Basically what bothers me about stuff like this specifically is that in my mind it detracts from the /weight/ of the magic. Basically, if it's just a snap-your-fingers type deal it has no meaning, weight or importance and it all just goes... bland. Similar to a Mary-Sue issue
