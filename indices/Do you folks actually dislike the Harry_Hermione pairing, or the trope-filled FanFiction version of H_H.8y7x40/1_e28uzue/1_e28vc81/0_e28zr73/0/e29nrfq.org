I think one could write an interesting story with a natural (born that way) animagus as a character - but that has to be their whole schtick, not just one of the many "cool" things about them. If Harry's a natural animagus /and/ the BWL *and* the heir of Slytherin */and/* James Bond's nephew, then it all starts to look stupid.

Tropes are tools. Some are just harder to use well then others.
