Yeah, I despise that.

Just the sheer powerbloat in some fics. Like they're not okay with making Harry unique with one thing. He can't /just/ have one fantastical world changing power.

No, he's got to be an Occlumens who used that to find a completely new(and far superior, btw) way to become an animagus, and his form is a magical animal which doesn't happen /ever/. And he's got a familiar that's a magical animal that's never been a familiar before /ever/.

Oh, and he got his Runes/Potions/Arithmancy/Alchemy/literally everything masteries at 11 so he's just going to Hogwarts for connections to use later on in his career beating the Wizengamot into shape as Lord Potter-Black-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Peverell-Flamel-Huffle-fuck me I feel dirty after typing this.

Sorry, these make me really mad. I ran up on like two of them in a row earlier and I'm still really annoyed.
