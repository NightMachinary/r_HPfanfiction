  Incidentally tho, I'm starved for H/Hr fics that don't suffer from these maladies, so if you've got any suggestions I'd greatly appreciate them.

I've got nothing on hand, unfortunately.

You're right that so many Harmony stories are bashfests or suffer from these other tropes. It sucks how much of the ship is just a glut of these same story ideas over and over. The easiest choice is when Ron leaves during the Horcrux hunt, but it's also too easy to make that a Ron bashing.
