no he outright says it's trash, which it is. a soul bond by it's nature should be a long slow arduous process(you only get one soul after all) but fan fic writers usually jump the shark and show people bonded over a random event and then the bond does nothing but good things and makes the people involved akin to gods and the deus ex machina hovering over every aspect of their story.\\
it's like that "and then they had machine guns and voldemort never really considered muggle weaponry dangerous" tripe all over
