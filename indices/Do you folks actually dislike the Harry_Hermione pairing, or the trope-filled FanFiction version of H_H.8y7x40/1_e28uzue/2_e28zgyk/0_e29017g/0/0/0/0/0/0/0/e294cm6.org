Excuse me if you don't notice the fact that I'm only responding in kind.

Notice how any comments where I even slightly insulted someone in this thread(which only really is you and the other guy) were prefaced by biting/negative comments.

I get that this is a "he started it!" argument, but it's the internet, and I feel like it's justified to respond in the same figurative tone that people talk to you in.

If you'd prefer, I can just block you too, but I'm not going to sit here and take your annoying attitude with a smile on my face and try to engage you in pleasant conversation if you're going to be a prat.
