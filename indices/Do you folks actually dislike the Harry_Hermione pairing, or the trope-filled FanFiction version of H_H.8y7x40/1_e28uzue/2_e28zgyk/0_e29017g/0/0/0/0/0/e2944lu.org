I don't know why you feel the need to include this despite multiple times me claiming that I rarely even read the trope(as you wish to call it).

Sometimes I don't understand why people in this sub are unable to have a discussion without including passive aggressive comments/jabs at anyone who disagrees.

I don't think defending a trope and the authors who use it really warrants any abrasiveness at all, but whatever. Maybe I just don't belong in a sub like this-- I never realized it was so prickly.
