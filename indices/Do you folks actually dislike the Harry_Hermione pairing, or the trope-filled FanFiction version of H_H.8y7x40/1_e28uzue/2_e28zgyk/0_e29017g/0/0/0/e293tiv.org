  a soul bond by it's nature should be a long slow arduous process

Clearly you misunderstand the genre(at least, the version of it that HP fanfiction writers usually use) if you actually think this is true.

I agree that a lot of fics in this category are done badly though. You listed a lot of the problems that people fall into with it, but that part is the actual bad writing-- it's not really the fault of the genre that people fall into common pitfalls.

You don't have to like soul bond fics. I'm not a huge fan of them myself due to how rare an actually good story is that includes them, but those good stories do exist, and being insulting towards good authors by saying <x type of fic is trash> is annoying.

It's kind of annoying having to defend a genre of stories that I'm mostly ambivalent to just because people in a Harry Potter fanfiction community of all places is being elitist about what writing tropes are acceptable or not, so I'm probably not going to bother with this any longer. I just wanted to make the point that soul bonds in general aren't just to force a pairing-- people can agree with that or not I guess.
