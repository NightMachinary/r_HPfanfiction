Interesting-- someone I'm arguing with looks at my post history and thinks that it's negative based on an already-formed negative opinion of me.

Guess I'll self-reflect on that.

Oh wait, nope, just gonna block you.

Keep starting arguments that should be discussions though-- I'm sure that'll work out for you.

Just gonna point out though as a parting word that this is a *writing sub*

There's at least some expectation that people aren't complete assholes towards other writers for absolutely no reason. At least, that's the culture I've come to expect in writing subs-- especially fanfiction subs in particular.

I guess people like you don't feel like following that culture though, which is unfortunate. Hopefully you improve yourself for other people's sakes.
