I don't know where you pulled me claiming it was a /good/ genre out of, because I didn't say that.

I just really hate it when people dismiss a genre as bad/lazy writing rather than just say they don't like it.

It's really fucking rude, honestly. I'm not even a huge fan of the genre but I'm not going to issue a blanket statement essentially calling everyone who writes in it out for bad writing, and implying that it's only a "guilty pleasure" niche.

Anyways, I'm blocking you. You seem like an extremely unpleasant person who I have no wish to see on what's supposed to be a decent fanfiction-related sub in the future.

Good luck finding enjoyable fanficiton with such a shitty, dismissive attitude though.
