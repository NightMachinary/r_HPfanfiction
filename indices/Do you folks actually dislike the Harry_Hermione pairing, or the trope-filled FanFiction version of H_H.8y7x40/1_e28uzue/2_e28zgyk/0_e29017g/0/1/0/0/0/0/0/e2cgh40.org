You stated a literary opinion but it looked less like a literary opinion and more like an attack on readers and writers in response to a misunderstanding of your prior statement followed by you misunderstanding a statement regarding the use of a literary device to achieve a function as a statement followed by the other dude being even more of a passive agressive ass and using fake kindness to say they don't like you and don't want to listen to you anymore to which you responded by being a passive agressive ass about it and trying to get the last laugh. Honestly the whole thing was blown out of proportion likely due to what I call the spacebattles effect. The spacebattles effect is what I call it where either one person or everybody sounds like a passive agressive ass regardless of whether or not they are which riles people up until everyone involved is, whether they are trying or not, overtly being a passive agressive or just plain aggressive ass. From my experience this leads to thread revivals 2 months later when one party looks through and thinks they have something to say or a new person picks a side and never really end until the op makes a new shiny, a moderator intervenes, or someone comes in with hardcore centrist derision of everyone involved. For examples of this phenomena go to spacebattles forums around creative writing, old vs debates, or whitehall where basically everyone is an asshole even if they're not an asshole.

Basically I'm trying to ovverride everyone's douchebaggery by being the biggest dick. Also I was bored and needed to look like I was working like I am right now.
