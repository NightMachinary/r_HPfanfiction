Gonna respond anyway, regardless of you blocking me, for the audience.

I got it from the same place as you got me claiming it being objectively bad, /I was speaking about my own personal opinons and taste,/ which is what the thread is about.

Also, pot-kettle-black my friend, whatever moral high ground you thought you had, you just lost it. You get butthurt about my taste in literature so you resort to personal insults and attacks, declaring me essentially a shit person, /and I'm the "unpleasant person"/? I'm not one for throwing a fit, so not gonna block you in turn or anything, but definitely reported for breach of rule #3. Wow.
