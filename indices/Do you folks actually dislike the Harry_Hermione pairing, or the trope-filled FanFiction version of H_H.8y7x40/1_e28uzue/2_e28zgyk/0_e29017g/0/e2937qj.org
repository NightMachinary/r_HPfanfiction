You certainly implied it was a bad thing, which you still do in this reply.

Though you're kind of switching messages from "People use soul bonds to do x bad thing" to "soul bonds are lazy and bad writing" so I don't really have anything left to say to you.

Different strokes for different folks. One genre of writing is not bad just because you don't enjoy it.
