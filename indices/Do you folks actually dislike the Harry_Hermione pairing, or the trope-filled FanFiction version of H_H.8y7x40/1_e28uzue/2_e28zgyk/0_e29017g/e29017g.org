>Soul bonds aren't really just a thing to force a relationship between two specific characters, it's an idea that people actually like to write/read about

Did I say that it was, or that people don't? I find the trope to be childish and lazy (as I do with all "predestination" type concepts) personally, but of course "people actually like to write/read about" it, it wouldn't be so popular otherwise. Daytime soaps are also very popular, doesn't make them less tripe IMO. We've all got guilty pleasures though.
