I actually like the idea, one of my favorites in fact, but I dislike the hoops authors jump through to make it. Like, they can't just *be*, it can't just be "oh, it just happened to be Harry and Hermione instead of Harry and Ginny", it's always some soul-bond bullshit, or it's Lord Potter-Black-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Peverell and his god damn manor house getting married in 3rd year, or "oh we're both natural animagi (because that's a thing, surely) who just happen bo a breeding pair of fucking lions, because why be subtle with our symbolism".

Oh, and the bashing. Yes, Ron is a horrible person and possibly a future abuser and rapist because he has poor table manners as a child, that's how that works.
