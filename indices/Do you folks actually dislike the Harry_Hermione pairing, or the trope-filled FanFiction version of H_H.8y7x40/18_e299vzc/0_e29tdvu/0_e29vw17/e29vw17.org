linkffn(6574535) Unlike a Sister by MADharmony. It's unfinished but everything that the author put down is simply amazing.

linkffn(4418163) Fulfilling Obligations by forbiddenharmony7. This is nearing completion and the author hasn't abandoned it. I think she said it has 1 or 2 more chapters to go. This is good but not quite as good as Unlike a Sister.

And just to tip in my own couple of cents, linkffn(12699243). Owl Night by WizardWriting (me). This was inspired by Unlike a Sister which is the best out of the three I mentioned.
