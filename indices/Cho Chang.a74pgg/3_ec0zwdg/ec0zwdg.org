[[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Betrayal_of_the_Best_Kind/index/][Betrayal of the Best Kind]] is my go-to Cho story. It's post-GoF, framed!Harry that goes to Azkaban story with no bashing. There's also a completed sequel. Very good action scenes.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/horst_pollmann/][Horst Pollman]] also has a long H/Cho series (2 million+ words) on schnoogle. The plot is completely original after GoF and the writing style is a bit strange - some love it, some hate it. I personally love it.
