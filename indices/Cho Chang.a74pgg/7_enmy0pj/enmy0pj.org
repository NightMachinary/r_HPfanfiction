A classic C.C. biofic, mostly canon compliant, as I recall (it's been years since I read it). The original story takes her to her fifth year (Harry's 4th, i.e., GoF). There are sequels for her years 6 and 7.

... and if I may be so bold as to pimp my own: [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/jacynthe/TSS.html][The Silver Swan]]

(not the only fic by that title, sadly). Femslash Cho/Ginny but most definitely not porn.
