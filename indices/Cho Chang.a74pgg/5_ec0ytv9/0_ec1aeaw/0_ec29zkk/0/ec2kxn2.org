Well, I remember the house husband thing. IIRC my rec was short and sweet but had an author-opinion-insert in the last paragraph where they ranted about men wanting sex while she is on the period (and that Harry was a good husband for not doing so).

I was just confused if I had forgotten about some house sitting agreement where I was supposed to go to next.
