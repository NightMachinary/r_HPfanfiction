Oh heck yeah!!! Thanks for bringing this up--this series is unsurpassable. OP, it takes awhile to get to Indigena Yaxley (also called the Thorn Bitch!!!), but she is so worth it, and the whole series is wondrously imaginative, grim, and lovely. Highly recommend. I basically treat this series like actual favored books--I read it every summer.
