Semi-spoilers for the recommended fic below.

The Sacrafices Arc by Lightening on the Wave has a character who is a dark witch OC who specializes in herbology and does some cool/messed up stuff with it. A rose bush that blooms when a very powerful wizard born and shows their alignment (light, dark, grey), thorns that grow through flesh (like I said, she's a dark witch), even a pod she crawls into a la Poison Ivy... Kind of. And a bunch of other stuff.

It's a pretty huge series of all seven years with a really complex magic system and cool OCs. It's slash... Kind of. Harry and Draco do a really formal courtship and it's never explicit.

I don't know if you want to read something this huge when it's a secondary character that kind of fits your request, but it is an excellent piece of ffiction.

It's also pretty harsh against James and Lily Potter and Dumbledore, but they earn it in the fic. They so earn it.
