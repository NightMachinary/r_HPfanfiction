RotW has the Statue of Secrecy. It's a 6th (5th?) year canon divergence. Wizards do take over the Muggles and the World. It's a great read with a Darker and unforgiving Harry. It's a Harry/Daphne with 2 more wives towards the end. Very slow but detailed beginning and a great 2nd arc. Highly recommend reading it, if you haven't
