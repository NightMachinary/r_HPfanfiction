I remember reading a few fics in which he was a drug addict, in which he was a sniveling coward, in which he was basically male Walburga.

Those fics all had two things in common: they showed Orion in a positive light and only featured Arcturus marginally. Get the drift?

There's not much of a point in featuring Arcturus specifically if you're just gonna make him yet another evil Black family member. He's usually there to play the role of the wise old man turning his family back from the brink of disaster and extinction, if he's shit he doesn't fit the role.
