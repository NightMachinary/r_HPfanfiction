I've been playing around with an idea for a while that you might find amusing: Some kind of a magical accident happens, and Hermione starts seeing all the creatures Luna talks about constantly, and she has to eat her words big time as Luna becomes a world-renowned magizoologist for her discoveries that she publishes with Rolf. A lot of double-taking would be had, I assume.

I actually have the opening scene written for it:

  As she came to, she soon realized everything still hurt. Her body was sore to the bone, and she could barely make her fingers twitch without crying out. There was a soft rustle on her left side. She flinched, but then as nothing happened, she turned her face towards the sound. She slowly opened her eyes.

  She saw Luna sitting in an armchair, reading a tattered book. And next to her, a creature like she'd never seen before. She had a sinking feeling in her stomach.

  “W-what is that, L-luna?” she croaked out. Her throat felt like sandpaper. She must have been out of it for a few days.

  “Oh! Can you really see him? That's a crumple horned snorkack. I'm happy you awakened, by the way, we thought you might not make it. I'll go get the others for you!”

  As Luna stood up and left the room, Hermione continued to stare at the creature before her, one thought solidifying in her mind.

  /Oh Merlin, i have finally gone insane./
