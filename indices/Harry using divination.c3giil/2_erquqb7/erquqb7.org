Hmm, I guess that depends on whether you mean canon divination or more fanon interpretations (usually ends up with some scene of discovering how amazing this is then some older character explains why it is no longer used despite the utility).

Some examples:\\
Linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches: Revenge is a Dish Best Served Raw): divination is written as a lot more elaborate and intricate here, mainly basing off a more general interpretation of the word "divine." Still good though.

Linkffn(The Firebird's Son): Harry is more or less a seer (visions, prophecies, the whole nine-yards), with a mentor!Trelawney thrown in, but the world is heavily AU and very dark (take my word on that).

Linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero): Harry dimension jumps, after a while ends up as the divination teacher. Probably closer to divination in the books than any other fic, though not quite the same.
