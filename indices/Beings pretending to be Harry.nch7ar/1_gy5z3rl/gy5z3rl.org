There are a few I can recommend, but one that I absolutely loved before the author stopped updating on ffn and moved to AO3 is a very slowburn snarry fic (which is really one-sided at first) called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11696688/0][Be the death of me]] by Hweianime. It's basically a Harry!Death-the-cosmic-entity fic. It's really funny for the most part, but the snarry is personally super cringe (and this story is part of the reason why I don't like reading them anymore), but it's still a great read. And even though it's basically abandoned on ffn, the author still updates it on AO3 under the same username (last time I checked, at least, which was a few years ago).

P.S. It has Percy/Harry in it as well for a little while, and that relationship is super freaking cute, like, I'd gush everytime I read it for how adorable it is!
