You joke, but I'm working on something with Harry and Katie (although not penpals), hopefully done by the end of the month.

I've bounced a few penpal ideas around with my beta, but we couldn't come up with a satisfying endgame. The current idea would be Harry/Fleur starting OotP and told almost exclusively through letters (so it should cover books 5 and 6 within 10k), but we are struggling to figure out how to resolve the Horcrux hunt arc.
