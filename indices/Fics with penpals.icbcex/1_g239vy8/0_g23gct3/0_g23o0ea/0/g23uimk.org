Harry vs Voldemort is easy, a good ambush and he's gone even if he'd smear the wall with Harry in a fair fight. A point blank magazine of Polonium rounds from under the invisibility cloak, Gryffindor's sword in the back using the same method, plenty of ways to get rid of Voldemort.

I'm looking for something which avoids the Horcrux Hunt or resolves it in a manner you could easily summarize in a letter since I want to tell the whole story through them (which means oneshot or it'd be a drag).

As for the Katie one, I'm basically writing some of my own more humorous school experiences transferred to the HP universe. It should be entertaining, even if not the most romantic of stories.
