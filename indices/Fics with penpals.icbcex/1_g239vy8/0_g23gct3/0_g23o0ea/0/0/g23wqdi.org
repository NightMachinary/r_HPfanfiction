personally i think the idea of waiting to confront voldemort till you find all of his horcruxes is silly. he has a magically made body, lock him in it. kill him over and over and over while you try to track down the remaining horcruxes. waiting to you find them all is asking for trouble.

how powerful is he? can he succumb to potions? muggle drugs? is his body super strong, can it be locked away? if you spend a bunch of money can you launch him and his horcruxes into space on an escape trajectory from the solar system just to mess with him more than death could? he might live forever but if his horcrux is out past the heliopause will his wraith still be able to do anything on earth? if it gets far enough away in will there be time lag that makes all his actions very humorous?

also, i approve of all harry/katie stories. it needs to become the new fad before i can finally rest from my crusade.
