Why would Voldemort be bullet, sword or poison proof? He isn't superman. And given that the house elves turned the battle of Hogwarts armed like a peasant mob, it would not even be mugglewank.

Agreed on the timing, the canon method is more complicated, although getting rid of the Ministry control will be more difficult if not impossible without a costly final battle.
