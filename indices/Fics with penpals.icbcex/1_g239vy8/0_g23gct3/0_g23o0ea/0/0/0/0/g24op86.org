i dont know why voldemort would be proof against methods of demise. the point of not killing him is so that he doesnt go back to a wrath like he did post quirrell as well as somewhat nullifying his remaining horcruxes.

don't need to destroy them if you can keep him alive but imprisoned in some manner, or turning him insane. crucio the bastard for 30 hours and see what his horcruxes do, worth a try right?

i personally dont mind the ministry worth bothering with. they will flock to the winner of any battle(if you remove key voldemort supporters who push the agenda).
