Been pushing for harry and katie for a long time. its gonna be great to see one of the good writers take a shot at it.

I think for harry/fleur the issue with the horcrux arc is we dont know a ton about fleur's abilities. this means how you write her will have a major impact on what directions a story can logically take. ive seen it done several ways with fleur, the most satisfying for me personally is not living in a bloody tent for no reason and taking the fight to the enemy in some way. reacting to the enemy is how you lose.

I think that with the goal of trying to figure out obscure hints about where voldemort might have stashed his soul would be best done trying to infiltrate his organization as well as torturing death eaters for information. if the taboo on his name is still around it shouldnt be TOO hard to get a hold of some entry level thugs to start with anyway. traps are very effective even discounting the more silly uses of the taboo trap scenarios.

Not sure what the vibe you are trying to go for is but i could see fleur choosing to be used as bait in some scenarios, going well or not.

Personally I think fleur using some veela seduction on bellatrix to extract information could be a funny and different plot idea too.

for me the hard part of the end of the books is the hp vs voldemort fight, it never feels right unless one of them just destroys the other, but most people dislike that style of ending. something anticlimactic where its just all of the sudden over because in the end everyone dies and a fair fight is a stupid idea.

sorry for my rambling its stupid o'clock and ive been drinking throughout most of it.
