Jenorama, gryffindormischief for some great Hinny. Jenorama esp has written several stories in her own universe, started before DH came out, inc the epic California Dreamin', and several one shots and short stories set after that. For some great Scorbus, id recommend The Quietly Series by starlightpeddler, Sweeter than Ficton and its sequel by liittlerose13, and Im loving fromredtoblue's Its Tea Time series. Plenty of good reading there, enjoy!
