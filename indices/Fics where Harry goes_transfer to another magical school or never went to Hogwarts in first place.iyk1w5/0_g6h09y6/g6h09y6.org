This is my first time using the fanfiction bot so I'm not sure if I've got it right lol. If not then [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10648774/1/A-Beast-s-Virtue][here's the link]] too. The premise of the fic is that when Harry runs away at about 10, Karkaroff recognises him and takes him to Durmstrang, where he is educated. It's a political fic so there's a lot of good worldbuilding and competing political groups outside the ones we see in canon. It's one of those where Harry isn't the centre of the universe, if you know what I mean.
