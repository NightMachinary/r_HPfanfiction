Breastfeeding wouldn't work, obviously, but wouldn't be required since Harry was only orphaned at a time when he could reasonably be expected to drink bottle milk. And yes, educational dementors, why not? Surely Dementors teach /their/ young the ropes somehow, they could just stick Harry in that class. I recommend linkffn(Dementors by Myranya) for an exploration of what Dementor "society" might be like on the inside.
