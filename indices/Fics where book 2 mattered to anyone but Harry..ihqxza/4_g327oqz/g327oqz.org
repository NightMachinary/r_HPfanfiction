One of the later chapters in white knight grey queen brings it up as ginny still has a bit of tom in her head that shes been fighting with for 4 years. And in a fic I've been trying to find but cant remember it brings up that ginny had mental issues after that and fixated on harry kinda becoming something like bellatrix was towards Voldemort
