I never understood the appeal of Wolfstar honestly, if you want to see a slah fiction with Sirius as the main pairing, just write one with Sirius/James pairing during the Marauders Era, Seeing the full worship that Sirius had for James during canon, I wouldn't be surprised that he considered James to be more than just a brother. It makes far more sense that him being with Remus.

And for the problem of respecting canon( if you want your story to respect canon) then you can write a story with a lot of ANGST where James is slowly falling in love with Lilly while Sirius is ANGSTY ANGSTY because his brother, more than just a brother, is slowly abandoning him for a woman.
