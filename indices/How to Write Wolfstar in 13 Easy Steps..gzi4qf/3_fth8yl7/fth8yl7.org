Replace Remus with anyone known for inevitable emotional pining and self-doubt and Sirius with anyone that can be realistically portrayed as a "saint" and you have every romance fic in the history of ever with those kind of personalities. While postwar SSHG isn't really a pairing I particularly like, I find it decent enough (I avoid the more typical teacher/student version of that ship), but man, that ship can get stale at times for basically this exact reason. Replace Remus with Severus and Sirius and Hermione and there you have the SSHG version of it.

While my favorite Severus pairing (Snily) doesn't really follow this scheme, that doesn't make it free from issues either: authors of the ship really love their Peggy Sue, and while I like the trope, it can get a bit old at times when that's 90% of what that ship seem to entail fic-wise.

I've come to the conclusion that all ships have their own idiosyncrasies and if you can't stand the common tropes, you're unlikely to enjoy looking for fics with the ship, despite any theoretical liking of it. For example, while I really like the idea of Harry with Nymphadora Tonks, I detest the most common tropes associated with it -- particularly the "true form" clich√©, so I no longer bother looking for fics with the ship. Really, what I like the idea of is a fic where Harry gets paired with her in Auror duty (with her surviving the war) and getting closer with her as a result, ultimately leading to a romance. But I've never seen a fic like that.
