Oh hey, I was actually thinking of writing a couple of fics with this premise! No OCs, but not HP characters either. One would have been a Warhammer Fantasy character, the other Joan of Arc.

I've set them aside for now, cause I have other, more fleshed out ideas I'm working on, but I'm glad I'm not the only one who likes that idea, and I hope you get some good recommendations!
