I'd love that...hell, I'd ammend it to:

Harry rejects all adults trying to muck up his life ("Haven't you done enough? Placing me with the Dursleys/Allowing me to be placed with the Dursleys and allowing/forcing me to grow up ignorant of my own people and my place in society? Yes, you have so you have rescinded your rights to make decisions for me, the Dursleys forced me to grow up quickly after all! So SOD OFF/GET LOST!") and make decisions for him (or try to protect him!)

That would include:

- Dumbledore (for obvious reasons!)
- Molly (not his mom and too overbearing and overprotective!)
- Remus (coward who never tried to visit...he should have been smart enough to look up the Dursleys in phone-book!)
- Sirius (revenge was more important than Harry it seems, so why should Harry forgive him (Note: I love Sirius Black, but I think that Harry wouldn't be wrong if he didn't accept him ASAP!))
- Tonks (she's fun to be around, but she's a Dumbledore toady and frankly: She doesn't have any right to boss Harry around etc.)
- All order members
- Ministry flunkies/stooges/thugs etc.
- etc. etc.

ps: I'd love to read that!
