While not the main focus, Fred and George get some amazing moments in Meaning of One by Sovran. There are some glorious and gut busting school-wide pranks that hit Snape and even Dumbledore. And, they are a lot more involved in the main plot than in the original, Fred and George have detention with Harry in the forbidden forest in PS/SS when he encounters Voldemort and the Unicorn.
