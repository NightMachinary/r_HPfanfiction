I've had reviews deleted before, because the authors couldn't take constructive criticism. While I can be harsh, I try not to be while personally talking to an a writer. After a while, I started to review on DLP, where people expect harsh criticism.

I'm never going to tell a writer "Your fic is shit", but I've said things like:

  Your spelling is all over the place. Grammar needs plenty of work. The conversations don't feel natural at all, and Harry sounds like a Goddamn fifty year old man, not a 12 year old. You need to make your characters sound realistic, they're kids at a magic school, not socialites.

I've got the rather bad habit of cursing (when I'm not at work) and it tends to bleed over to my writing as well. It sometimes makes me seem harsher than I really mean to be. I try to avoid that when reviewing, but it slips out every once in a while.
