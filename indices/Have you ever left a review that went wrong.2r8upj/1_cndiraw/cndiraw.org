I was trawling the new submissions on FFN and one caught my eye so I read it. I thought it had an interesting premise and was somewhat original. I wasn't really thinking when I wrote the review and I pretty much went through it like I was grading it-pointing out misspellings, grammar errors, and suggestions to tone down the fanfictiony-ness of it. After that, I told them all the things that were good, pointed out things I liked, and said that I was looking forward to reading their next updates.

Today, I went back to read through it again but it was deleted. I feel pretty bad. They had said they wanted criticism etc and I wasn't harsh or mean, just matter of fact! But now I feel like a troll. :/
