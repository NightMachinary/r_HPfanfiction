I once collected all the typos/misspellings in a separate list during my read-through and---after finishing the story or deciding to drop it---posted everything I've collected in one big final review.

Stopped bothering after the 5th out of 6 such big reviews got ignored by the author.

Still have the “compulsion” of highlighting all the errors while I'm reading a story though, so now I just ask first (also telling how many errors I've picked up precisely), and only if the author writes back I send them the 100+ “proofreading” list.
