I read a story where I could tell that the author wasn't a woman by three pages in. A person bought a bra for someone else, from a store they'd never heard of -- *and it fit*. That's a bloody miracle.

I mentioned this in a review. The author PM'd me in a huff, saying it's fiction and he can do whatever he wants. I guess one of the unstated rules of magic in his AU is that all women have breasts that exactly fit Victoria's Secret sizes. (Was Victoria's Secret even available in England in the 90s?)
