To be honest, it really isn't your place to police fanfics like that. If that's what he wanted to write, then that's his thing, it's not like anyone was forcing you to read it, and if it was against the site's rules, then a simple report would have solved that. There really is no reason to write a review complaining about the subject.

I don't care for slash (at all), but you wouldn't see me writing reviews on all the slashfics at ffnet complaining about it. Even if the fansite had a 'no slash' policy, I'd simply report the story and move on. Wasting time complaining about it is just that, wasting time. Same thing.

TL;DR It's fiction, it doesn't matter. If you don't like the subject, ignore it. If the subject is against the rules, report it.
