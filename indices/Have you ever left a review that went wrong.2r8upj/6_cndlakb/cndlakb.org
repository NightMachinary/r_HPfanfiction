I left a review that went something along the lines of "the squick is really unnecessary. sexualizing tweens/children is disgusting. if you want to write that kind of porn you really should take it somewhere else as it doesn't fit on this kind of story/site." The author had underage sex (10,11 year olds) and parent/child incest in their story. He then continued to post that shit and claimed I was flaming him in one of his ANs at the beginning of the story. It was an okay story up until then too.
