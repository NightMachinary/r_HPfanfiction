Tooooootally. A fic popped up called "Did I Do That?" Which was supposed to be a super!grey!independant!Harry, but in less than 1000 words has Harry run on paragraph think about how everyone sucks and Sirius is dead and Fumblegore doesn't care and angst angst angst. I posted a review saying there was a lot of problems with the fic, extremely short, massive spelling and grammar mistakes, as well as some weird content issues, like saying Harry was going to do something "like Luna:Slytherin style" which I pointed out as well. I suggested ways to clear it up and lengthen it, providing more fleshed out content etc.

The second chapter went up with over half the word count accusing people of saying she sucked, is just doing this for fun, and doesn't have time to write even 5000 words a chapter. She ended the a/n by saying she doesn't really have a plan for the story and is under writer's block. I couldn't find it when I went to double check my review and it was down. Oh well, I guess?
