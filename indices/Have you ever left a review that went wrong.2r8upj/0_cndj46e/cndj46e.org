I came across a new fic by chance that was pretty interesting but was so riddled with grammar errors, wrong words, and the like, that I left a review praising the elements of the chapter I liked but indicated some of the errors.

I didn't check the author's profile but assumed it was someone for whom English was not the primary language.

Author was USA based. S/he reacted by sending me a hatred filled PM that claimed I was picking on them because they had ADD and that I was being abusive. I tried to explain by repeating that I liked the story but that it was very hard to read because of all the errors, but that only made things worse, another few hate-filled PMs followed.

Fortunately it ended there. They deleted their profile, taking the story with it.

I don't point out grammar etc. errors out in reviews any longer now unless the author asks for them.
