That's a great fic, for only 40k words it's rather well done. I found the characterization of Draco believable and I absolutely love the Daphne/Harry interactions. Its refreshing to have a fic that focuses on the school interactions rather than the fight against Voldemort.

As to fit your criteria? Linkffn(Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7) has Harry running a black market within the school and eventually gets caught by Dumbledore

Edit: Antithesis has a very cringey summary. However I would ask you to give it a chance; as it has really done some incredible things really. Harry is not edgy, he is not overly powerful, and his conscience is a major inhibitor.
