I don't have any personally in my writing, but I've noticed that in an absolute ton of fics I've read involving Lucius Malfoy, he seems to often pick lint off of his robes. At least three that I've read, all with different authors, have said nearly verbatim "he picked an invisible piece of lint from his clothes." Usually after being insulted or trying too act nonchalantly superior.
