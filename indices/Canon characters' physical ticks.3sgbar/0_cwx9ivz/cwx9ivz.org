I'm not remembering any canon stuff but I've got some headcanon on how they sit and their posture.

I bet Ron is a sprawler with an arm over here and a leg up there, elbows out. It was a thing we did in a big family-grab extra space while you can to try and preserve it. Hermione has good posture in general as required of her long hours seated studying. Her parents taught her proper ergonomics. Of course, after an all-nighter, she can slouch with the best of them. When Harry first came to Hogwarts, he had the tendency to make himself appear small, as if trying to be nonconfrontational. Backed hunched a bit and shoulders rolled forward. He quickly got over it and carried himself with more confidence.
