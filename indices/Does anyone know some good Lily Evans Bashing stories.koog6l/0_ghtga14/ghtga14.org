I'm honestly surprised there aren't more stories where James and Lily don't hook up and Lily regrets it (I made a request/prompt of this months ago); a more vanilla role-reversal where a bitter Lily feels conflicted and torn on seeing James' children; simple Hogwarts fics where James is starting to move on from a clearly "uninterested" Lily and she becomes more than just a metaphorical green-eyed monster (jealousy).
