I love a good bit of Slytherin!Harry and I've got a free day, so I'll give this a one sitting read. :) "11'th" at the end of the first chapter is a bit jarring - no reason for the apostrophe.

EDITS:

Chapter 7 - 'felt like she should ask for more information', should be 'he'

Chapter 11 - For the password, 'Ad Altoria Tend', I think it should be 'Ad Altoria Tendo'?

Chapter 15 - 'All 4 of you' only refers to Draco, Harry and Ron as far as I can tell. So 'all three of you'?

Chapter 16 - Maybe we just have differing views of her as a character, but I definitely think that McGonagall would say Mother and not Mom
