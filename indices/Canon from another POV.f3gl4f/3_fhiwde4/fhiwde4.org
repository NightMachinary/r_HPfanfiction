Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness, I don't like the Snape bashing in there. I mean yes he's an asshole, but murdering students is not really his style. Other than that it's pretty good.

And Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce, it has Gordon Ramsay, so it's not canon, but it's the best fiction about what happens while they are hunting horcruxes that I know.

If you by any chance understand German I suggest Severus Snape und... der Stein der Weisen/Kammer des Schreckens etc to you, all books until the fifth from Snape's POV. It is completely canon compliant. It's brilliant, He is so in character and it's absolutley hilarious. Also he spends almost all his time drinking with Charity Burbage and McGonagall. And he likes the Weasley twins and helps them with some of their experiments but they pretend they hate each other in front of everybody else. It's so funny.
