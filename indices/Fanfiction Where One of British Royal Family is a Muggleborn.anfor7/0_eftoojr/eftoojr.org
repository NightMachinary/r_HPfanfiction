Kind of a morbid thought, but what about a story where Princess Diana was secretly helping smuggle muggleborns away before the coming school year when the corrupt Ministry of Magic made school attendance mandatory and was killed by Voldemort? She died on August 31, 1997, the day before the start of school for the timeframe of the Deathly Hallows, basically a month after the Ministry had fallen. Maybe even a Muggle liaison to the Order and a friend of Dumbledore?
