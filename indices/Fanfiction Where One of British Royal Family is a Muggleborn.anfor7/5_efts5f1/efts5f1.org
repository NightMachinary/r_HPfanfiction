I don't recall exactly which one it is, but there's a story which should be a multiple Cliche Bingo winner - Harry has a soul bond with Hermione... and Daphne; Harry and the witches are sent back through time ("to right what once went wrong..." wait a minute, that's the wrong franchise), they get Sirius released, Pettigrew captured, the Longbottoms cured, etc.

Anyway, one plot point almost lost in the crowd, has Justin Finch-Fletchly as Viscount Lonsdale, his father Earl Bedford, and his grandfather Duke of Kendal. Those titles, in particular the one for Kendal, to quote Wikipedia, "have been created several times, usually for people with some connection to the royal family."
