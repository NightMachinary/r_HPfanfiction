There is plenty of â€œQueen Elizabeth takes over and resolves all problems using muggleborn UK Army units" stories. I really like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11500936/1/Long-Live-The-Queen][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11500936/]] which is kind of straightforward implementation of the idea. And just now I finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6652537/1/Quoth-the-Raven-Nevermore][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6652537/]] and I am not too excited about it.

Generally I think JKR canon universe is very bourgeois and it is possible that in very closed community some kind of hereditary aristocracy could develop, it really doesn't sound well when students in Hogwarts call themselves "Lord SoandSo" and "Heiress Whatever". It just doesn't fit. Aside from Quoth the Raven promises a lot of gore and blood and in the end it basically has no climax whatsoever, it just drowns in all Lords and aristocratic junk.

That was also one of many reasons why I haven't enjoyed "Royal Ward" much.
