I don't think so, I mean, the transformation seems to be because of the presence of a Full moon (and possibly just its presence, otherwise it should be possible to stop the transformation by remaining in a dark place) not the absence of sunlight. I guess a spell to blow the moon could work, though it would cause some minor problems for the rest of the world.
