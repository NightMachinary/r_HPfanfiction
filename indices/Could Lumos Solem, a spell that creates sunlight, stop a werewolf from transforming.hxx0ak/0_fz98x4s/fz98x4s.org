No, because the werewolf transformation is triggered by the full moon, not by the absence of sunlight.

The book and movie both made the stupid error of having Lupin transform when the moonlight hit him on that one night, directly contradicting how even canon says the transformation works. If this was the case, then it could be mitigated by locking afflicted people in windowless dungeons to prevent them from transforming. It says right in the story that it doesn't happen that way, and that a locked up werewolf attacks themselves in the absence of any other prey.

Werewolves transform when the full moon rises which, by definition, is sunset because a full moon means the sun and moon are on opposite sides of earth.

(Which, incidentally, is ONE night out of every twenty-eight. I will nope out of a story that talks about the three nights of the full moon. The full moon is, scientifically, a specific /time/ when the sun and moon are in full opposition.)
