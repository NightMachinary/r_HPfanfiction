I feel it depends on what a person thinks causes the transformation.

Sticking to PoA Movie it seems to take the approach that it is the moon light itself that triggers the transformation. I'm not sure on exactly what is said in the book.

What I find difficult, when fanfics give a cure, is that often the cure isn't complex enough and/or not built on new ideas/findings for to me believe that it hasn't been done before and isn't in widespread use.

If we take what the film does - contact with moon light causes the transformation - and expand the idea: I'd say that Infected/cursed humans could be driven (by the curse) to seek out moon light on transformation nights. They might destroy and kill objects and people that try to stop them.

My guess is that the infection/curse is linked to the cycle of the moon. When the cycle of the moon reaches a certain point it will cause the transformation.
