The following two collections have some very good one-shots, many of which I wish were standalone stories as they would be easier to locate if so:

nonjon's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4746187/1/What-a-Bunch-of-Nonjon][What a Bunch of nonjon]].

Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/1/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Adventures in Child Care and Other One Shots]].
