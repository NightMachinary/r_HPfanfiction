Two of my fics have backwards changes that happened years before the fic took place.

In the first one, I added a series of "memories" from the backstory that tied in with the current timeline. Since it was an AU travel fic, it worked with the storyline to add these little elements peppered throughout.

For my second story, there wasn't any universe changing, so I added the key "memories" (those which caused the differentiation from canon into my AU) as a prequel chapter and posted it alongside my first chapter. Then as the story fleshed out, I would add any details through exposition or dialogue.

We're either of these methods considered effective? I'm not sure, but they made sense to me and I didn't have too many questions in the reviews about what was going on. For the first one, I did leave an Authors Note stating they'd be getting the background throughout, just to give some kind of context.
