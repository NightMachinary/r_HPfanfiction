It's hard to tell without knowing your context. Can you give any more info on the situation that's changing?

In my first story's case, I had little tags before each memory section and they were in italics to keep it separate from the main story. It also helped that I placed the memory part at the beginning or the end of the chapter, so it truly could be read separately if the reader wanted to.

When it was done in the prologue, I had dates before each memory (I believe there were three or four). The hardest for this story, was putting the rest of the info in exposition and dialogue throughout. For that, I used an outline to pinpoint where each piece of information would fall and then wrote a scene around what I wanted to tell. Again, I made sure to use an Authors Note at the beginning of the fic stating that they'd get the backstory throughout. It is difficult when choosing to write several years after a large changing event, but I found trying to incorporate it into the storyline left the readers anxious to find out what happened as the main storyline unfolds.
