This is great! Now I had to write something too.

------------

Albus smirked, unable to hide the feeling of pleasure of his inevitable victory.

"You are truly a worthy opponent, my boy, alas your defeat was inevitable."

Slowly he placed down his +2 Card, eyes focused on the frozen boy in front of him.

"UNO, my Boy." spoke Dumbledore, smugly.

Albus chuckled. All had worked out perfectly, just as he had foreseen it. Blinded by his own arrogance, the boy had completely ignored the possibility of another +2 Card. The fool, it had been predestined. His victory was always predestined.

"How?" whispered Harry, horrified.

"Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design, Harry."

Contently, the old man leaned back in his seat, his smirk ever present, eyes twinkling far too much.

"I...I..." stuttered the boy.

Harry's fearful eyes went to the desk again, undoubtedly looking for a way to escape his utter defeat. Foolish boy, there was no escape, not from him.

Albus remained smiling, his hand reaching out to the pile of sweets the boy had betted. Now it was time to enjoy his victory.

A deep chuckle stopped him in his tracks, making a shiver go down the old man's spine.

Harry's head snapped up to him, his eyes almost glowing, an amused smirk now on the teens lips.

"You are a fool, Albus. For I have foreseen that you would foresee my moves."

Albus heart stopped, his eyes widening.

It...It was impossible.

"UNO, Albus." said the boy, while laying down the last +2 Card in the Deck.

Albus Chair fell back as he jumped out of it, eyes still on the Card before him, the shock written in his face.

"No..NO! HOW?!" raged the defeated Headmaster.

"Your feeble UNO skills are no match for the power of a game night with the whole Dursley family, Albus. I have been trained in the arts of UNO deception since I turned six, old man." declared the boy wile taking the back of lemon drops.

"This has been fun, lets do it again sometime."

And just like that, the door closed.

Albus screamed, his raged overwhelming all sense of rationality as he randomly trashed everything in his office.

IT felt like hours but somehow the Albus managed to regain his control, now standing among rubble and screaming portraits.

"Soon...Soon, young Harry. Soon, I shall have REVENGE!"
