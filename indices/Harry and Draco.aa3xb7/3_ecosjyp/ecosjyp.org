It disturbs me. I like sausage and I like tacos, but I never liked Draco/Harry, much less Draco/Snape or Voldemort/Harry- more because they're racist bigots against Harry and his Mother than anything else, and usually don't change.

Are there fics, tons- but none that I think are good enough to recommend honestly- well, "Rise Of The Wizards" Linkffn(6254783) (Read it's prequel first, linkffn(6206646)) and "They Shook Hands" Linkffn(7659033), the latter a series, were good but they didn't decide to start whispering to each other's trouser snakes.
