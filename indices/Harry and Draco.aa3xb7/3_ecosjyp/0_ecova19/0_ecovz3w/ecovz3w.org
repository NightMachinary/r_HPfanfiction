Tom/Harry makes more sense as crazy as that sounds, particularly when it's not Voldemort- such as the being from the diary before Tom went completely batshit insane - or from the scar- Harry's soul purifying the part soul or the part soul learning and growing from Harry- I've seen it done decently more often than I've seen Harry/Dracos working out- such as Moratorium Linkffn(9486886), a criminal/female Harry and a relatively sane Tom.
