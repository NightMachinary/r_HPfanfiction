I totally agree with not liking the Draco/Snape. I see Snape as Draco's mentor or a father like figure kind of like a godfather, only their relationship is much different to other godfather and godson's relationships due to Voldemort. The Voldemort/Harry thing is just wrong on all levels. Thank you for your suggestions....
