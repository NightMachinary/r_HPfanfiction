  What do you think of Harry and Draco being a thing?

Unless the story is vastly AU, I'm not even entertaining the possibility. Anything remotely close to canon after 5th year that results in H/D slash is an abomination.

  Any fics where they are together?

Literally 216k stories in ff.net with Harry/Draco romance.

If you're asking about H/D stories I've enjoyed... there is exactly one. linkffn(Snakes and Lions by Gatewaygirl)

Beyond that Lomonaereen (of The Art of Self-Fashioning fame) has a bunch of mostly AU H/D stories. I've perused some of them. I found all of them at most mediocre, though highly superior to all the garbage H/D fics on ff.net
