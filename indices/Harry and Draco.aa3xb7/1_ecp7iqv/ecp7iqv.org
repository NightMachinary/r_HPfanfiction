If you're looking for recommendations I have read a lot of Drarry, and can suggest a bunch of fics. It would help to know if you're looking for anything specific though. Just a quick few of the top of my head - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550/chapters/6887378][Running on Air]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879835][Salt on the Western Wind]], [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/rhysenn/IP01.html][Irresistible Poison]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12627042/chapters/28770501][Like Clockwork]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9167785/chapters/20815621][The Man Who Lived]].

I do not see Draco and Harry as ever getting together in the canon universe, but that's the beauty of fanfiction. I like the idea of exploring the idea of two people with a complicated past learning to overcome that and becoming friends and/or lovers. I love getting to explore Draco's character, the depths of who he is, who he became - something we really only get a glimpse of in canon. Plus, as a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I like to read about relationships that aren't hetro, so that's a bonus. I also hang out in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/][r/HPSlashFic]], and if you're looking for other recs you're welcome to post there.
