The Shoebox Project is basically /the/ fic for this pairing. [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/shoebox-pdf-chapters/]] It's sort of tropy because it is the origin of most MWPP tropes.

Stealing Harry [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/987408]] One of the earliest examples of the Remus/Sirius raise Harry genre.The author actually abandoned the Hogwarts part of this fic.I don't know anyone who continued using his own notes or put out their own version using his notes(or changing them a bit.)
