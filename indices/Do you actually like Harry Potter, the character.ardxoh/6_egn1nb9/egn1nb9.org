I love Harry, I dont think he's very realistic. He should be a barely functioning mess of neglect, ptsd, intimacy problems, Pavlovian bad habits (don't get better grades than your dumb af cousin or you will be punished) terrible stress responses, extreme instability (on account of having a bit of a madman's souls stuck to his face) and general lack of functionality as a member of society. He shouldn't be a decently well adjusted quiet kid who gets into trouble alot and will practically sacrifice his life for the first person he meets that shows an inkling of kindness to him.

Quite literally in spite all that, Harry Potter is one of the best fictional allegories for self determination and not letting your circumstances define you. Which is an incredible message on its own, completely disregarding all the other positive messages in the series. (Love is something that can save you from darkness, even the most twisted villain was once just a child like you and could have been helped, etc.) For this reason and a few others, I love Harry despite how unrealistic he is.

However, that same un-realism also makes it kind of hard to discuss his traits the same way we do the others, as we do that by contrasting their actions with their words, their beliefs with their behaviours, their circumstances with their responses, etc... and Harry doesn't respond like the others do because of how unrealistic he is.

We don't discuss harry like we do with others, because the same type of discussion would be entirely useless to analyze his character.
