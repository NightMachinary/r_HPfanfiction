Why should Harry have apologized? Oh, I don't know... Harry was the one snapping and calling Ron names... Harry was the one who blew up at Ron and threw "POTTER STINKS" badges at him when Ron was obviously showing up because he was worried about Harry, and then telling him "maybe you'll get a scar, that's what you want, isn't it?!" Harry was by far the nastier person. Ron mainly just pulled away and refused to talk to him. At first Ron even tried to pretend he didn't mind, but Harry got pissy because Ron didn't immediately be 100% supportive like he always was. Yeah, can't think of ANY REASON why Harry should apologize for that.

In DH, Harry is the one who tells Ron to leave. Twice. He's the first to hurl insults, and the one who insists that Ron get out, only telling him to leave the Horcrux.

Yes, Harry was under a lot of stress. But saying he has nothing to apologize for is stretching it.
