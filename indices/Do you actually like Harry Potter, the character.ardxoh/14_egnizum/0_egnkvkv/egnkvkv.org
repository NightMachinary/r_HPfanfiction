... Why should Harry have apologized? In GoF, Ron is the one who instigated the entire conflict because of his jealousy (and IIRC, Harry cuts Ron off and tells him to forget about it before he can get any elaborate apologies in); in DH, likewise, Ron starts shit when the Horcrux gets to him out of nowhere, then abandons his friends to face a dangerous mission alone (and that whole scene where he comes back addresses Ron's insecurities and has Harry specifically reassure him, too.)

I don't want to demonize Ron by any means--- he's a teenage boy, and it'd be pretty boring if his friendship with Harry never had any conflict--- but I think it's a bit of a stretch to say Harry should've had to apologize for... not having saintly patience in the face of Ron's provocation. At other points during the series, like when he's snapping at everyone in OotP, he does get called out for it, so I'm genuinely confused by this--- lucky kid def has the benefit of plot armor at times, but when he's acting like an asshole, the narrative acknowledges it.
