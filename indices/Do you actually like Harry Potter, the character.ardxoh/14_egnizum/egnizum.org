I think Harry is overall the blandest and weakest-characterized character in the series... but I also think that this is by design. Harry doesn't get a very strong personality because he's the reader-insert, the one that the audience is not only meant to identify with, but the one they experience the wizarding world through. He's not QUITE as personality-less as some "reader insert characters," but compared to just about any other character in the franchise he isn't very interesting.

But I think Harry is a very SUCCESSFUL reader-insert. Fans really do identify with him, to the point where they instantly forgive or ignore any of his flaws. I think that's why people are much quicker to condemn Ron and Hermione... and why so few people ever even consider whether Harry is actually a good friend to them or not. I mean, Harry certainly never does... he has a remarkable lack of self-insight in that he in general demands a whole lot more from others than he's willing to give back.

One thing that strikes me as REALLY illustrating this is that... Harry never apologizes for anything. It never even seems to occur to him that maybe he should, even after he's been pretty horrible. Both times when he and Ron reconciliate, Ron is all apologetic and ready to take all the blame, but Harry (who was actually the nastier one in GOF, and in DH did not have the excuse of wearing the Horcrux when he hurled insults at Ron) never even seems to consider that he has anything to apologize for. And the readers, likewise, just hold him completely blameless... probably because when Harry doesn't acknowledge being in the wrong, the readers don't have to either.
