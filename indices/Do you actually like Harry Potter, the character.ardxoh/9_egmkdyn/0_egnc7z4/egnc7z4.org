Its been a while since I've read the books, but from what I recall each book effectively had a different Harry. Which does make sense to a degree considering how old he is and that he goes through a lot of stuff, but it doesn't entirely feel like the progression of a single character.

Additionally there are the issues that come from JKR's writing style, and the fact that Harry is somewhat hollow to act as a PoV character.
