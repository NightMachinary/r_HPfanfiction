Harry is kinda difficult to judge because he has several directions in which he is developed and none bar one are carried out consequently. There are:

- The poor, abused orphan

- The hero who takes up arms when the need arises

- The boy who is thrust into a situation way beyond his abilities

- The born leader

- The broody teen

- The Messiah who lays down his own life without second thought

I like most of these bar the last one. The broody teenager might be annoying to read, but it is believable if not overdone. The Dursley abuse should have some consequences on him, but there is no need to exaggerate the canonical abuse.

If Harry has to die, give him some epic death like Leonidas. Give him a strong position and throw waves after waves of Death Eaters at him. Have him kill Bellatrix and Dolohov before finally going down. Maybe some sacrificial bomb defence like Virmire (ME1).
