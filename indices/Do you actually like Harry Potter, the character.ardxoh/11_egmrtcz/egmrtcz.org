I like Harry's story and potential he had as a character, 'cause he could improve himself and explore the new world around him as he had a great motivation to do so. What I didn't like is he actually did nothing. Voldemort was after him during all Harry's youth, but he didn't study, or do some specific trainings or even explore Voldemort himself as an actual threat. I argue that all success he had was due to his incredible luck and help of other people. How far would he go without Hermione (oh, yes, this is my girl, I absolutely adore her) who really think about the problem and reasonably tries to make Harry and Ron study and be aware of the saspicios items (like the broomstick from Sirius on the third year). Ok, back to the topic, I kinda like Harry, however I'm quite disappointed that he didn't do a lot of things he should have. I mean, you know, even before the prophercy was revealed, that there is a guy who wants to kill you, no matter why - DO SMTH TO PROTECT YOURSELF THEN. Or even earlier then Harry just learnt about the Wizarding world. Why didn't he explore it, just because of simle curiocity, like Hermione did? Why didn't he actually ask anybody abiut his own parents? I din't like how passive and hotheaded he is. Maybe it's just my specific taste and I simply favour another type of characters. But I still love reading the original books and fics about Harry (that's why I'm here, ha). And I love how protective and loyal Harry is) I guess, it sounded like I don't like him at all but I do, just not as much as others. Hah, he is quite a controversial character, isn't he?
