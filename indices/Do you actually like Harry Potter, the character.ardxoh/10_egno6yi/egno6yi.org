Harry's my favourite by far. Absolutely love him. I don't understand people saying he's got no personality, I think he's got plenty. Which is why I like him.

But Harry in fanfic is tricky... there are many, MANY fics that I've read and enjoyed immensely, but off the top of my head I can't think of even one that perfectly captures Harry, IMO.
