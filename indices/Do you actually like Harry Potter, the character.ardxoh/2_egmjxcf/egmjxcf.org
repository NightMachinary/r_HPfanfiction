I adore Harry. I think people turn to fanfiction for expansion on secondary characters and themes, so that might be a lot of what you see here. Canon is all about Harry and I think people feel if they want Harry, they can reread the books.

Personally, I enjoy reading and writing stories that are more Harry-centric, but I think some folks have definite Harry fatigue.
