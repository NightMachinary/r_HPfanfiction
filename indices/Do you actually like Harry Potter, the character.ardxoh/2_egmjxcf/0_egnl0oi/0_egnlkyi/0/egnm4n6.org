I think this sub is pretty representative of the fandom as a whole. If you look at fics sorted by favourites on FF.Net, for example, they are mostly Harry centric. Yes, there are prolific communities of people who are enthusiastic about non-Harry-centric fics. The numbers above don't rule this out: the 45.6% of people who equally or greater prefer non-Harry-centric is still a lot of people. It's just a lot smaller than the mainstream as represented on this sub.

The fact that people with niche interests have their own communities somewhat evidences the point: when exposed to the mainstream, people with niche preferences are overwhelmed by the numbers of people who have no interest in that material, so they seek about specialist communities where their preferences are the sole focus.
