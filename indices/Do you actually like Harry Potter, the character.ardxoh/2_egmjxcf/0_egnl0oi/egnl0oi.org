We can actually put numbers to this from the 2018 subreddit survey.

#+begin_quote
  Do you read fics where Harry is not the main character?

  850 responses

  Yes (I enjoy them equally): 37.5%

  Yes (I prefer Harry-centric): 40.8%

  Yes (I prefer non-Harry-centric): 8.1%

  No: 13.5%
#+end_quote

So of the people who visit this sub, just 8.1% actively prefer fics which are not focused on Harry. Basically, the moment you choose to write a fic in which Harry is not the main character, you're facing an uphill battle to attract the 54.3% of the fandom who exclusively or actively prefer reading about Harry.
