Personally I'm pretty neutral, leaning towards not caring, about Harry.

I didn't identify with any of the characters in canon so that's not the issue. Instead I think it's just that I find Harry incredibly boring, so I rarely have anything to say about him (for or against).

All the characters I have the most to say about are characters I either actively liked or disliked. With Harry I just don't really care.
