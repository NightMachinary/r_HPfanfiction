Harry has such a wide variety of characterisations in canon, more than any other character. Angry, angsty, determined, smart, happy, confident, etc. I definitely enjoy Harry as a character, but it's because he's without a doubt the character that can produce the most reaction from me. Whether that's happiness, sadness or frustration he evokes something.
