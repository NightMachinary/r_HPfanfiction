Honestly, I'm ambivalent. I have nothing /against/ Harry, I'm just not particularly interested in reading more about him. He had all of canon, focussed on him. Also, he was not the character I most identified with - the one who was my place marker in the world. Whether that is because I am female, or because I was well into adulthood before reading the books I don't know. All I know is a story featuring Harry would not be a deal breaker but it isn't a drawcard either, there are other characters I would rather read about a lot more.
