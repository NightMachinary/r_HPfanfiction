I think that he is uninteresting as a protagonist. In canon, Harry was designed to have the setting revolve around him, and without that, he has little to offer. Take away the Prophecy and the destiny (even if he is still an orphan), and Harry would be content to spend his time hanging out with friends, playing Quiddich, and maybe occasionally standing up for someone being bulled: a wholesome character, but a fairly ordinary one. He is Horatio, not Hamlet, in other words. There's a reason why fics that do something non-Voldemort-related with him tend to rewrite his character to the point of being unrecognisable.
