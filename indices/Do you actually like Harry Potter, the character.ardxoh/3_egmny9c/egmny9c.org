His personality in canon is pretty divided I feel. From him caring about his friends, to being broody and angst-y, to not caring about what blood status you have, to having a sarcastic attitude, to having a saving people complex, to being an orphan to finding out that he was a Wizard.

There's so much that you can do with his character, but too many times I only see people focus on one or two of his traits. (Either the angst or hero saving; is the most often I see).

I was going to say he isn't my favorite character, but after really thinking about it, the other characters, their character development and interactions... yeah; I'd say that Harry is my favorite character. He's so interesting and a pretty complex/difficult character to write well.
