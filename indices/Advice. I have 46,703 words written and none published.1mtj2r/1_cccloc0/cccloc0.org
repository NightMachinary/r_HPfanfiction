If you have the patience, I strongly recommend that you hold off posting until you have the first book complete. The times I've done this, the final product was more polished, more internally consistent, and ultimately more popular than when I've not. As a bonus you can publish on a faster schedule, say a chapter a week, and it's easier to find a beta reader willing to read a complete work than a partial work. Readers will follow even a sub-par story if the update rate is fast (see, e.g., the popularity of Darth Marrs's Firebird series, which updates like clockwork every Saturday). And they will get more excited and invested in a story that way.

As for advice on the story itself: edit, edit, edit. Ten passes through--tightening prose, sounding out dialogue, ensuring characters are in character, ensuring the plot is consistent--isn't excessive at all. Make the final product as polished as possible, something you're proud of. Good writing will attract more readers.

When you do start to publish, recognize that if you're new to publishing fanfiction, it's going to take some time to build up a set of readers. Promoting your story in various forums, e.g. here, will help. Consider posting your story on more than one archive; I recommend fanfiction.net as a minimum, as it has by far the largest number of readers. But check the sidebar for this subreddit and see if there are other archives that would make sense for your story. Spend time on your summary--make it interesting so readers will want to check out your story and ensure there are no errors. Make sure your story is properly categorized; a lot of readers apply filters when searching for new stories. Finally, search through the list of popular C2s for your fandom and see whether any make sense for your story. If you find one or more that do, send an inquiry to the manager of the C2 and ask whether they would be willing to add your story to their list. Getting your story onto popular lists like this helps a lot with traffic.

And don't get discouraged if your first chapters don't see a large number of hits or reviews. My first few pieces languished for months before I started attracting readers and it's taken years for my stories to acquire a million hits and a decent number of reviews. Unless you're very fortunate, success won't happen overnight (much like in traditional publishing).
