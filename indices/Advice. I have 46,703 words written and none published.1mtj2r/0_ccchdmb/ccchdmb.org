First, congratulations!! That's a great wordcount and a worthy goal. As for advice, I would definitely find someone to beta read or edit before you post anywhere. No matter how experienced the author, it's a rare one (in my corner of fandom anway) who doesn't have someone look it over for SPaG at the very least.

You haven't mentioned the type of story you're writing. Is it gen? Is it het? Is is slash? The type of story will go along way in determining where to post. Most stories are posted to fanfiction.net, unless they're slash and/or explicit. If you are writing slash or a story with graphic violence, both of which violate FFN's terms of service, many of the authors have moved or are moving to AO3.org (Archive of our Own). They accept any rating and any pairing--or no pairing at all.

As for posting, you can either post regularly, like a chapter a week, to gain some traction, or you can put it up as a chaptered fic. I've found that putting up 50K words as a one-shot can put some people off.

I hope you find some of this helpful.
