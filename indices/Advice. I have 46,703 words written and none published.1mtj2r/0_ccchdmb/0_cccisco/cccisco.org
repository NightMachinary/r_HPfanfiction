Thank you, but I'm far from done.

How should one go about acquiring a "beta reader"?

It's set in the future of the HP world (all of Harry's kids have graduated Hogwarts). While I do involve some of the characters from the canon story (Neville is a professor, Harry makes an appearance or two) the characters we all know and love are not in any way the focus of the story. I have been trying to keep the focus on my characters.

Ideally, though this may be unrealistic, I would like for there to be 7 books. I am mimicking the structure of JK Rowling by following one character and writing mostly through their eyes. This means the storyline in book 1 will be decidedly less complex than will the storyline in book 7.

I follow my main character (who is NOT a Mary Sue, I promise) as she journeys to Hogwarts and gets herself wound up in her own sorts of drama. I will be remaining within canon restrictions set down by JKR where they are known to exist, and creating my own rules and nuances where JKR has not yet ventured while trying to remain in the spirit of canon (meaning I won't be creating exploits that allow for characters to suddenly dominate over a given field).

As I'm following a girl who begins the story at age 11, there is nothing explicit in the story and there won't be for a few years of her life at least. Keeping with the JKR tradition most of the romance will remain fairly tame on that front when and if it does come. No explicit sex scenes for now, and likely none ever. I'm a little bit more descriptive in this area than JKR is by nature, but when and if the time comes to write those scenes I don't plan to overdo it.

I like the idea of one chapter a week. Currently I am working on chapter 12 averaging a little more than 4,000 words a chapter. I have 19 chapters planned, but I may need to add a chapter depending on a decision I have coming up. I am also considering adding another chapter so that there is more "regular school" going on. Right now I feel like there is too much story advancing and not enough story building. We'll see.

So the question becomes whether or not I should hold off on starting posting or not. Should I find a beta reader and begin posting as soon as she/he is finished with the chapter, or should I hold off? It's taken me about 9 weeks to get through 11 complete, unedited chapters. I kind of fear that with a chapter a week the readers will catch up with me if my pace slows.

What do you think?
