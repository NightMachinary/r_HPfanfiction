Ooooh! Original fic set in the wizarding world! Excellent!

First, finding a beta reader is not terribly onerous. I know that betas can register with FFN, though to be honest, I've never tried to find one through that site. I've found mine through trial and error.

I started posting my first HP story on hpfandom.net (and I really should have mentioned that site) and within a couple of chapters, a reader volunteered to beta for me. I joined a community on Livejournal, which is still surprisingly active in the HP world, and found another one through there. Or you can do what you're doing and post requests here. Judging from your post, I suspect your story is already very tight, though it never hurts to have another set of eyes look it over and ask questions. What the reader sees and what the author intended aren't always the same thing.

As far as posting, let me share with you my experiences. I started a novel and posted each chapter as I finished it. Two years later, it's still a WIP (work in progress). A few stories later, I signed up for what's called a "Big Bang Fest" put on by my ship's LJ community, wrote a 235K word story, and posted it a chapter a week knowing it was already finished. My suggestion? Wait until you're finished with Book 1 before posting it, and that includes editing it (though I tinkered like hell as I was posting). In the meantime, I keep signing up for fests and my poor WIP sits there, patiently waiting for me to return to it.

In the meantime, keep writing! The Harry Potter fandom might be shrinking, but it's still healthy and stories are added to it daily.
