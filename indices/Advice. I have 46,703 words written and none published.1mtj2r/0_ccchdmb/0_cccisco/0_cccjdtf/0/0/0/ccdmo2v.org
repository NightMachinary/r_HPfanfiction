And if it's anything like Middle Earth, fandom will see another big bump when it's released.

I agree that HP is much like Star Wars/Star Trek. There will always be people writing and creating for it, especially since we have the Marauder's and NextGen eras to play in, as well as the canon years to explore. Judging /solely/ by the goings on in my little corner of the sandbox, I'd say that productivity is down by about 20% from two years ago, but that's still a goodly number of stories being written.
