Not really, though like Kwan Li's other notable H/Hr story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]] (which is complete), it's told in the format of two books stuck together. The first book is done but the second is WIP and rather slowly updating.

You could read up to the end of the first and then wait for the second to be completed if you don't like reading a WIP.
