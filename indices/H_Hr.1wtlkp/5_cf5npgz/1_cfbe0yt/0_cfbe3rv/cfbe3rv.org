I've honestly only liked 2 soul bond fics, the rest were all pretty horrible. The first one is obviously Error Of Soul, and the second was Sovran's "Meaning Of One" series.

I've also read /Bonds Of Blood/ and /Harry Potter & Fate's Debt/, but disliked both of them. They felt rushed, and Bonds jumped the shark about halfway through.

The thing is, the soul bond fics I do like, I /really like/. Meaning Of One is probably my favorite romance series out there, despite being unfinished. Do you know any other good ones?
