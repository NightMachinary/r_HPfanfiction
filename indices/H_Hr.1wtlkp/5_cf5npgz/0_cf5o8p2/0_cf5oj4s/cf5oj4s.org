Exactly how I feel. I took a break from fanfiction for about 5 years (starting in 2008), and came back a couple months ago hoping to find all the old fics I'd been reading finished.

Nope. Nope. Nope. I've got a gigantic list of bookmarks of unfinished fics, some of them far better than the original novels. Makes me sad man.
