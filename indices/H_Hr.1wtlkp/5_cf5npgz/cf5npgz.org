  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.
