Full Stories:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4061219/1/The-Time-Meddlers][The Time Meddlers]]: After things have gone terribly in the war, Harry and Hermione decide to travel back in time to stop the war from happening. Things go well at first, until...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160475/1/Harry-McGonagall][Harry McGonagall]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5820125/1/Harry-Potter-McGonagall][Harry Potter McGonagall]]: Professor McGonagall has watched the Dursleys all day and can see what sort of people they are. When Dumbledore leaves Harry on their doorstep and disappears, she takes him away.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6305490/1/Not-So-Muggleborn][Not So Muggleborn]]: What would happen if our favourite bookworm were sorted into the Pureblood-dominated House of Snakes? Here's one possibility... Decidedly AU. Complete. (This one is fun, as are a few of the author's other stories. Check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4882425/1/More-Than-Familiar][More Than Familiar]] especially, even though it looks like it'll never be finished.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5483280/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Champion-s-Champion][Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion]]: Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. (Author's not joking, he /really/ lets Ron have it in this story. That being said, it was absolutely hilarious, and well worth the read.)

One_Shots:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4151734/1/A-Harmonian-Way-of-Life][A Harmonian Way of Life]]: Tilting the Potterverse onto the path it should have taken post-OotP. Some minor Ron!Bashing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4973167/1/The-Curse-That-Killed-Thousands][The Curse that Killed Thousands]]: What would have happened if Sirius's appearance in the hospital wing was not received as relatively calmly as in canon? Unashamedly Harry/Hermione H/Hr , but in a family friendly way; Bashing of Dumbledore & cohorts included.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4780695/1/A-Collection-of-Harmonious-OneShots][A Collection of Harmonious One-Shots]]: Some are better than others. Contains various bashing, language, etc.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8725665/1/You-Can-Have-Both][You Can Have Both]]: Ron sends Hermione owlpost. Harry sees it, and he and Ron have words. Mentioned Romione, but ends fluffy Harmony. Ron-Bashing, you have been warned. One-shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8828969/1/Wherever-You-Go-There-ll-Be-Love][Wherever You Go, There'll Be Love]]: It starts as a joke: "We should take a vacation, go somewhere sunny when this is over," mostly whispered inside dirty tents and from behind thin blankets. Post-DH.

Authors Worth Mentioning:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/769110/chem-prof][chem prof]] has several stories that are well-written and worth reading, including rewrites of GoF and OotP plus a couple of post-DH stories.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2758513/Romantic-Silence][Romantic Silence]] writes both multi-chapters and one-shots, and not all of them have happy endings, so be warned. Still, very solid writing, and almost all of them H/Hr.

Honorable mentions go out to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/robst][robst]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1082315/broomstick-flyer][broomstick flyer]] whose writing is not the best, but their stories are still fairly entertaining, and almost entirely H/Hr. They're not the best writers, but their creativity is often top notch, so give them a chance if you feel so inclined.
