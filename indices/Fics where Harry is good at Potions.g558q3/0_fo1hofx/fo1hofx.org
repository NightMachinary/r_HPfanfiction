There's the linkffn(Pureblood Pretense) and its sequels - though it's not /quite/ the same as Harry being good at Potions, given that it's a female version of Harry. Definitely falls under the category of a potions genius, however, and it's a fun read - at least, if you don't mind a fairly powerful interpretation. I haven't read the fantasy novel inspiration for it, either - which I'm not sure if it'd add to the enjoyment.
