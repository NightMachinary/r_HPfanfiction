European influence makes sense if you assume that:

a) Wands are really useful and wandless magic is ridiculously difficult with worse results in comparison

b) Wands were invented in Europe, probably ancient Rome or Greece

These assumptions give a in-universe explanation for why the Roman empire was able to conquer most of Europe: Druids without wands are simply no match for battle-mages with wands.

There's also a simple explanation for why the Roman empire collapsed a few centuries later: Eventually the barbarian druids were able to reverse engineer their own wands which enabled them to fight back.

Dark ages in the magical world was a time when most magicals were peasants who only knew a few spells and only a few had good wands and books containing the knowledge of Roman wizards. Until Hogwarts came along and made advanced magic more accessible. Before Hogwarts many magicals weren't capable enough to defend themselves against muggle mobs, which explains Salazars paranoia.

By the Renaissance period muggles had developed better guns which made them dangerous to unprepared wizards again (pulling a trigger takes less time than casting a spell) and the European wizards decided to make magic a secret.

Around the same time European muggles were exploring the world thanks to their advancements in shipbuilding and navigation with little respect for the natives who had no chance against guns, and European wizards had to make sure the muggle explorers don't run into any native wizards so they told the native wizards that they couldn't use magic to defend themselves against the invaders. Most native wizards didn't like that but they had no chance against wands.

In short, the European wizards pretty much did the exact same colonialism thing with the native wizards that the European muggles were doing with the nonmagical natives. All in the name of Secrecy, because it's better for everyone.
