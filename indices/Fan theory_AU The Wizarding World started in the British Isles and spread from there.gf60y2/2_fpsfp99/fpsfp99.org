That is my headcanon. I always found it weird that the Wizarding World is so British or European. When wizards and witches have so many easy and fast ways to travel (even if portkeys etc have been invented only recently, just a broom already makes traveling so much easier). There would have to be a larger amount of cultural exchange over the years.

Why would Chinese warlocks use pseudo Latin for spells? If they invented their own spells they would use a language closer to their own culture. And with the many ways to quickly travel, at least some of those inventions would have made it to Britain over the centuries.
