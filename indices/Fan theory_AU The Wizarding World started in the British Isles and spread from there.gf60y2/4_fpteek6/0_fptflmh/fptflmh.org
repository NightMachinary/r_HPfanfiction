I saw that. I may be overly critical, but the way I interpret it is that since they're not registered with their ministries, they can't give their students any kind of official certification. The way around that would be to have people show up for ministry certification independently, but that still leaves questions on how each ministry would enforce the Statute of Secrecy, if they can't even keep track of who's teaching whom.

Sorry, overthinking stuff seems to be a hobby of mine, but that is a good catch on your part. "Official sources" seem to only provide enough information as to assure a thing exists and/or is being handled, without going into details.

Anyway, this is a prompt (though I don't mind the discussion), so the information provided can be taken as a given, for the purpose of building an AU or crossover.
