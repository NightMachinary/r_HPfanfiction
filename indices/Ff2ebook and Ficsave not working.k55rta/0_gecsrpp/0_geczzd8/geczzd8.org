Yup, I tried using a new browser - Firefox and it still did not work.

Right now I'm using [[https://beta.ficsave.xyz/][this]] and its been working well..

Thank for the reply, I'm on site so can't use my computer/laptop. Will be stuck here till the weekend, so I really need ff2ebook to work. I'll check if the desktop version works, when I get home.

I have not use Calibre on my mobile, I'm pretty sure it's desktop based I might be wrong.

Yup I tried doing both, using multiple different fics to try to download including some well known. So the mave the archive was on site, but it still did not work.

Either way thanks a lot mate.
