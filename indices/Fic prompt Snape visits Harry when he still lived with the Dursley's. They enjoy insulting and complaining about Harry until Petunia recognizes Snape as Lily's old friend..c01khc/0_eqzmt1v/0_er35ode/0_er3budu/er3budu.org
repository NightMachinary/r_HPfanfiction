Really, make some "Severus Petunia" search, and you get plenty of them. Half of the Severitus stories have a scene like that:

- linkffn(4912291)
- linkao3(14406414) ... OK, this is cheating, Petunia came to Severus
- linkffn(10101403) ... time travel, fixing past mistakes
- linkao3(925430)
- linkao3(12361260)
- any more? Basically go through search like [[https://is.gd/XkZJcl]] and you will get more than enough of stories like that.
