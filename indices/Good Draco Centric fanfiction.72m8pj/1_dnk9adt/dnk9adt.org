If you like Drarry, come join us at [[/r/HPslashfic][r/HPslashfic]] too!

But also, to answer your request, a really excellent canon compliant (EWE) Drarry I read recently is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9167785][The Man Who Lived]]. It has an amazingly well characterized Draco and he is the main character. It takes a little bit to get into, but it is really really worth it. Read through the second chapter before giving it up.
