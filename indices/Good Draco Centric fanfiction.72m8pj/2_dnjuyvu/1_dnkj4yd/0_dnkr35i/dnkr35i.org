[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness by Mira Minth]]

For all its canon rehashing tendencies and small issues with characterization, the above manages to radiate a breathless, oppresive aura that I have found in very few stories. You know how a percentage of the population gets goosebumps when listening to certain music? Well this does that, in fanfic form.

It attempts a risky gamble, by essentially stripping away Harry's plot armor; whereas in canon he stumbles around blindly, fueled by a vague sense of heroism (almost at death wish levels) and guarded by cleverly placed plot devices, in this story we start from the opposite direction: Harry is first and foremost guarded by his finely-honed sense of self-preservation. He recognises very early that if he wants security he will have to /work his ass off/ in order to be safe.

So all fic long, he works at it. He practices until he's competent and more at spellcasting. He cultivates a wide range of allies and dedicates painstalking amounts of effort to maintain them and keep them happy. He delves into dark magic. But at the same time, Harry realizes that he has to take risks as the situation grows more volatile; and so he courts the older Slytherins that are Voldemort's agents in the school, for as long as he is able; he undercuts the Order and agrees to become the Ministry's posterboy, in exchange for favors and to facilitate future cooperation; he manipulates his allies, frequently withholding dangerous information if there's benefit to it. He rides the razor's edge.

And as the story reaches the later chapters you start to feel that Harry's extraordinary bag of tricks... might simply not be enough. While canon glosses over Voldemort's power and skill, you get no such respite here; he and his Death Eaters are *fucking dangerous*, as dangerous as a 70 year old psychotic dark wizard served by the elites of a hidden society can be. And Harry, impressive juggler though he is... is still sixteen.

And that's the point where Mira stopped writing. Sigh.
