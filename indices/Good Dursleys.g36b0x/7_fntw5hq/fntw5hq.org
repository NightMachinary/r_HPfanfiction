This /sort of/ happens in Methods of Rationality. Petunia pressured Lily in making a potion to improve her looks, and landed a better husband than Vernon. They're loving adoptive parents to Harry, though Michael doesn't know about magic and is very skeptical when he first hears about it.

Note that in the first few chapters, Harry is not very respectful to them, which I think is a big part of what turns a lot of people off the story, but honestly is not unrealistic for an eleven year old. It's toned down in the alternate introduction, linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMoR).
