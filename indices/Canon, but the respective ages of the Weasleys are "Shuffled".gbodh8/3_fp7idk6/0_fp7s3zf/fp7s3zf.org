I honestly think it would be really good for Harry to not have the Seeker position handed to him based on his innate aptitude for flying after his first time on a broom. Having an opportunity to learn and practice being a part of the team under more experienced players, developing that aptitude into talent before actually playing would be amazing for him. He could play a match or two if Charlie was injured helping Hagrid wrestle some creature in the forest or given detention for sneaking into the forest himself. Maybe as his skills grew Charlie would step down after his fourth year to focus on his Owls and let Harry play starting his third year.
