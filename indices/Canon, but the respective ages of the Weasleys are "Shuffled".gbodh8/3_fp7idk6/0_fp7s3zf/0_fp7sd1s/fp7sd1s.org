In this set up I'd probably put Charlie as a 5th year on Harry's first. Change him with Percy. So Harry gets 2 years of reserve development, then Charlie steps back in his 7th year to focus on his NEWTs. I think Charlie being that bit older gives the option for more useful character development for Harry
