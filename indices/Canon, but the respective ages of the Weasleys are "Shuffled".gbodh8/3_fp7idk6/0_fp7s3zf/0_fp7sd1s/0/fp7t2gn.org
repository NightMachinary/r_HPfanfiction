Good point. I did like the idea of Prefect Ron though. I don't think shifting Ron to third year would do much for him, though potentially shifting him to Charlie's position would work well. He'd be graduating at the same time as Tonks and could potentially join the Auror academy at the same time as her. Actually, that would work really well. I could see a second oldest Auror Ron being in a relationship with Tonks. It could also bring her character in sooner than 5th year.

5th year prefect seeker Charlie would also make more sense for seeking help with Fluffy and Norbert, as he'd be much more approachable than Percy was. Though while I feel like goofy 3rd year Charlie would totally be on board with Fluffy and Norbert, prefect Charlie might be more responsible. Not necessarily a bad thing, just a different way things might go
