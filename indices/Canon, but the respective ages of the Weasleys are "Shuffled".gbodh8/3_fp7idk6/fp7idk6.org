Yeah, that could be interesting. If Charlie is at Hogwarts when Harry is, Harry doesn't immediately become the seeker. Maybe...hmmm, interesting progression from that. He still gets noticed as having talent and is brought in as a reserve seeker to train up ready to immediately take over when Charlie leaves or needs to cut games and focus on his NEWTs. How does Harry change as a character if he's got an older student acting in a close mentorship capacity? Could be an interesting way to adjust his character early to be more assertive, more confident, more outgoing.
