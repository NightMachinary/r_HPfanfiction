Ginny as the second Mum rather than the baby of the family would be really interesting. And for those saying she might not be tomboy or play quidditch (as if the two are mutually exclusive...) then I think it would be her much needed escape from the pressures of being the oldest and being expected to help mother her younger siblings all the time.
