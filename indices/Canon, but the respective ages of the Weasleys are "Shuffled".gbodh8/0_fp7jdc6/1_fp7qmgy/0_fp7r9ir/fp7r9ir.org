Its possible yes that Ginny's interest in Quidditch was due to having six older brothers, four of which played, but an interest in sports is not a gendered interest. Quidditch isn't a "boys club" that only tomboyish girls dare enter. I personally wouldn't describe canon Ginny as being tomboyish in the slightest either. Also we have no indication that Arthur and Molly kept popping out kids until they got a girl. They are a big family and happy with the size of their family. I don't see any indication in either of them that they would have preferred or chosen a smaller family if they could.
