Congratulations, you've managed to reach the conclusion everyone did a while ago: your proficiency at a /magical/ sport is largely influenced by how good you are with (that specific) /magic/, which is not exactly fettered by real world sexual biology!

i.e. use your imagination a damn bit.

Also you're literally allowed to have your wand with you while playing Quidditch (though you're not allowed to use it on your opponents or the balls themselves) - almost as if a magical community with historic disdain for Muggles isn't going to play a (and this bears repeating) /magical sport/ as if they are Muggles.
