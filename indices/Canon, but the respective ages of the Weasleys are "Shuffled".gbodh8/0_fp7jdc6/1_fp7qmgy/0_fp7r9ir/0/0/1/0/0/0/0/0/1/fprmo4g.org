The broom clearly corresponds to your will, which is why the whole "muscles from quidditch" thing is so hilarious. All you need to do is lean a little and dodge cannonballs. A non-wizard human, even the strongest bodybuilder, would have a hard time batting away one of these cannonballs with a wooden bat, so one of the two, or both, are clearly magical to alleviate that.
