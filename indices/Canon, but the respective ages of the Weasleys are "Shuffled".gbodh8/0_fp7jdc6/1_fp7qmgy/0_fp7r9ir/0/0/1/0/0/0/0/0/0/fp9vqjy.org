Not special /Quidditch/ magic, but /flying/ magic - a broom is as much a magical implement as a wand, and is equally useless in the hands of a Muggle or squib.

And yes people rarely think about it but Quidditch is frankly far more about flying ability than it is about sheer physical skill - think /equestrianism/, not contact ball sports like basketball or football. In fact, the closest real-world sport to compare with Quidditch would be polo, a similarly mixed-gender sport where your horse's breeding, constitution and training (and your synergy with it) can make or break your plays.
