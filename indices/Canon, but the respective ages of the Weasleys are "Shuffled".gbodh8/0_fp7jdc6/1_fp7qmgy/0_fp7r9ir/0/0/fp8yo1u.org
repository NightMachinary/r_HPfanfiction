Maybe as seekers or keepers, but female beaters and chasers are odd. Baseball or cricket aren't sports that require a very high level of general athleticism, especially pitchers/bowlers and batters are relatively stationary roles, and still women can't compete with men generally. Of course every single semi-professional and up woman playing either is better at it than a random untrained male, but Quidditch is played professionally, not just recreationally.
