Bill is a curse breaker in Canon, in this universe he could be the one finding hidden passages, even ones that aren't on the map (yet).

He could play a bigger role in the Horcrux hunt. Even though he might not be a *trained* cursebreaker. Give him somewhat of a knack for it. Or maybe he's a prodigy, like Ron & chess. Might be interesting!
