Ginny, the Twins, Ron, Charlie, Bill, and then Percy.

Interesting idea and I like the order you chose.

Ginny would work well as the oldest playing professional quidditch.

The twins could be living at home or in a small flat, running a mail order business while saving up for their shop.

Ron the perfect is one of the more interesting ideas. Ron's inadequacy with the success of his older brothers plus his resentment for living with hand me downs wouldn't be as big of a factor in his personality. I imagine that he would be rather like a mix of Bill and canon Ron. He'd be a cool older brother that wanted to make head boy to prove himself (I'm assuming that his desire to do so would remain, even without the canon comparisons to his siblings) and would probably also be playing quidditch as keeper. I'd expect he'd have played a lot with both Ginny and the Twins being quidditch players too. The eldest three, beaters, chaser, and keeper. Could even have a fun rivalry with Ron intending and feeling confident in joining the Chudley Cannons and leading them to victory against his sister.

I debated whether switching the order of Bill and Charlie as you have them would be interesting or not, but I think what you have works best. Charlie takes the Seeker position in his third year and takes Harry on as his protege. It loops the "third child slot" into the story earlier than canon, where Fred and George have milder roles until they introduce the map and start selling joke products. He can be asked for help about Fluffy and Norbert given his predilection for creatures and his interactions with Hagrid/escapades in the forest would be really fun to read.

Bill as the second youngest is actually the hardest to visualize. Personality wise I don't know what we'd see. If we'd see as much of the resentment of poverty as Ron had, if he'd still be academically inclined, if he'd still want to be a curse breaker. In a lot of ways I figure he'd be pretty similar to Ron, which feels a bit like a cop out, and thought would have to be given on how different Bill would be as the second youngest rather than the oldest.

I would write Percy as the baby of the family in a way where he's a smart, precocious, and rule following boy that wants to work in the ministry like his dad. He probably feels slightly offended that none of his siblings want to be like Arthur and is a bit of a daddy's boy. I also think his precociousness would result in a lot of condescending love from his siblings. They don't take the littlest with his dreams and his rules seriously, just smile and pat his head. Would probably end up as a really engaging character as he grows as long as he isnt railroaded down canon Percy's character arc.
