I mean hey, imagine Ron as the oldest, he wouldn't have the pressure of being the youngest, but he'd have the pressure of having everyone look up to him instead.

Or even if he was in Percy's place, somewhere in the middle. That'd still have him thinking what to do in life, but maybe not as insecure about it.

Having Ginny not be the youngest in general could be rather interesting. Say Percy, Fred, George, and Ron have a cool older sister in Ginny, how their dynamics might change.

Seeing how an older Ginny would react to Harry, instead of being the I have a crush on you type, she could be someone really cool that has a lot of rule breaking stories and willing to help them out from time to time (if she's still in school).
