Depending on Bill's personality being the second-youngest, it could go the same route in all honesty or he'd adapt a lot more quickly. It's hard to say how some personalities would change (Charlie and Bill especially as we don't meet either until Harry's 4th year....well, we get a passing mention of Charlie in Harry's first). For the twins, they might still remain mischief makers but maybe more reserved if they were the second-oldest. Ginny might not work as hard to prove herself as the youngest of 7 and the only girl if she was the oldest. Percy would maybe dial it back on the authority or maybe be handled with a bit more leniency and lighter pranking if he was the youngest (if he even experienced it as the Twins would be out of the house). Ron would be less insecure in Percy's place but maybe not as strict with the rules. Charlie would still have his love of animals, but he'd be more of a mentor to Harry, first in Quidditch and then maybe later in other areas, which would change Harry's personality.
