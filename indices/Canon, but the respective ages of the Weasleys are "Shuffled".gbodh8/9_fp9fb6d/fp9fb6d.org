I imagine having Ron in Percy's position and vice versa coule be really interesting: I tried to write it a few years back but couldn't get into it enough, annoyingly. The dynamic between a Harry, Percy and Hermione trio would be super private and unapproachable, and Ron would be best buddies with Oliver Wood, and if not on the Quidditch team officially, he could be, basically, the team manager or strategy guy.

If I remember correctly, I wanted to have the Twins as the youngest and Bill was in the twins' place, and Harry was never going to discover the Marauders' Map. Charlie was the oldest, and Ron totally looked up his older sister and wanted to get into Quidditch because of her.
