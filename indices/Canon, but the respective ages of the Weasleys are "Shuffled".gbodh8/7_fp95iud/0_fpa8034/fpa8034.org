Oh God, imagine instead of The Golden Trio, we have Marauders Two: Eclectic Boogaloo with Harry, Hermione, and the Twins joining forces (And yes, I do mean eclectic, not electric).

I even know how the quartet can get together as friends on Halloween: someone (doesn't really matter who) badmouths Hermione, setting her off to the girl's bathroom, and Harry brings up how he's worried to the Twins, who, having served detention with Filch a week prior, pull out the map to help find her, only to see that there's a troll in the hallway, lumbering towards her position. The three race off, right as Quirrel arrives in the Great Hall, and through the use of some rudimentary, still-being-tested joke potions and Harry casting Leviosa (we want the twins to show off their own stuff, so Harry gets to be the unoriginal prat), the troll is defeated. While Harry quails a bit when the professors show up, the Twins' confidence and propensity for showboating pulls the spotlight to themselves as they talk up how great they are "and Harry helped a bit!"

Hermione asks how they found her so quickly, the map gets explained, ane despite her usual Rulefullness, she immediately sees its value, and starts researching what she can on its enchantments (she doesn't have a side project like looking up Flamel yet, after all).
