LotR has a distinction between soul 'fëa' and body 'hröa' and that suggests that the Killing Curse would not work on a Balrog as Ainur (angelic beings) don't have either. Ainur have no requirement for a body and instead are one element, ëalar or being.

Thus it's entirely reasonable to assume that the Killing Curse would not work as they don't have a true 'body' to be separated from. Their body is just a manifestation of their soul.

The assumption that HP magic flattens LotR is simply based off a shallow understanding of Tolkien's Legendarium. The only thing that could really break LotR is Apparition as even the Valar have to walk places to get there (though they can do it extremely quickly ). Of course unlimited fanon Apparition breaks pretty much any setting so that's hardly unexpected.
