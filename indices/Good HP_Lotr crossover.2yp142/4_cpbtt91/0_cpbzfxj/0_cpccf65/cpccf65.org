Since the basis of the killing curse is separating the soul from the body it should. It shouldn't work on golems or otherwise controlled but not conscious being. Of course it's implied in canon that harry is not capable to casting it , so yeah bummer .

Still the oneshot i posted was just for the crack , it's short it's fun and it gives a prospective. There are many ways for an author to "disable" the ability [on the top of my head : midle heart has less ambient magic therefore apparition doesn't work , boom done] Otherwise apparition could be still abused even only going line-of-sight.
