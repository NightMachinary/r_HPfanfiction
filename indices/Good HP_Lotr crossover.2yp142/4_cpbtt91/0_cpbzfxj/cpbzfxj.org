I love how at the end it says many fics don't consider how HP magic works. They do consider it, that's why they use canon harry, who sucks at mind magic and can't travel impossibly long distances with one apparition jump. I also saw one with Harry being good at it but countering it with Sauruman using anti apparation knowledge gained from a tortured captured Sirius as a plausible explanation. But most of the time, he just has never seen the place before therefore he can't apparate anywhere. There are plausible ways to do things without horribly nerfing the characters

Also would a killing curse work on an immortal being?
