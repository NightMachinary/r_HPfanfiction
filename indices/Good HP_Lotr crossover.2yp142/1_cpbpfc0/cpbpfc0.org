Oh hell yes my brotha let me give you my list that I just got done with and enjoyed(Note:The child/elfling stories are not in my list, they bore me/confuse me/ arent realistic.Also on mobile so can't link)

- *Not quite a Maia*- No Pairings, Stars Neville(if you're feeling a bit uneasy about it, I was too at the start. Just go with it for a few chapters and you'll be hooked) Quite Funny too.

- *The wizard in the Shadows* - Harry goes to ME for R&R. Yea that doesn't happen. You're gonna want to read this

- *The next great adventure* by Tuare- Short but worth it

- *Boromir's Return*- This isn't a crossover but I wanted to include because it is one of the best LOTR Fan fiction I have come across
