If we're talking specifically LotR /setting/ rather than story then two unmentioned ones are:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10951863/1/The-Lonely-Company][The Lonely Company]]: A fairly vanilla, but well done, Harry-joins-Thorin's-company fic. Pity it's probably gone as far as it will ever go.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10473466/1/Fate-be-Changed][Fate Be Changed]]: Off the wall rec here. Barely a HP crossover really and has basically every Hobbit clich√© known to man but it's really nicely written and the characters are great. Also very respectful to Tolkien's mythos.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8879660/1/Doomsman-s-Herald][Doomsman's Herald]]: Just noticed this wasn't recced. It's a crying shame it never really got going.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8250381/1/Forging-A-King][Forging a King]]: Wobbly rec as it goes a bit strange and isn't brilliant but it's a nice idea and it's complete which is pretty much hens teeth in HP/LotR

I also have another HP/LotR fic in planning (I did The Power He Knows Not) but it's a big one and probably a long time away yet.
