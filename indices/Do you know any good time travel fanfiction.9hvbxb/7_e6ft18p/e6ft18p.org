you may find my Hermione timetravel compendium of use to you

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7ymqb6/my_hermione_timetravel_compendium_of_the_last/?st=jmdkcv08&sh=b6282dd4]]

And the previous one I made which is linked in that thread as well.

Two interesting ones: one hundred sixty nine ( [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8581093/1/One-Hundred-and-Sixty-Nine]] ) is very good. Hermione has 169 days to fix things

And a little child shall lead them ( [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them]] ) has hermione changing everything as a toddler and is a fun take on the trope
