As I said, I think it's good. The fic portrays how Harry is affected by everything that's happening around him.

I don't know if everybody would like such a fic though. I was a bit hesitant at first as well, it was on my "to read" list for a long time. It wasn't boring, I can say that for sure. It's funny, but not ridiculous.
