[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6728900/1/Far-Too-Many-Time-Travelers][Far Too Many Time Travelers]] is a bit different from other time travel stories, and I think the execution of this interesting idea is pretty well done.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4198643/1/Timely-Errors][Timely Errors]] is another story I like reading every once in a while.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][The Unforgiven Minute]] is already recommended.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5409165/1/It-s-For-a-Good-Cause-I-Swear][Oh God Not Again!]] is an excellent mix of humor and time travel.

Other stories I like (but more like in a guilty-pleasure way): [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8550820/1/Strange-Visitors-From-Another-Century][Strange Visitors From Another Century]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6337450/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Turning-of-the-Sun][Harry Potter and the Turning of the Sun]].

Also, I have [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3693052/1/Back-Again-Harry][Back Again, Harry?]] bookmarked, but I don't remember anything about this fic.
