Some do, some don't. I'm one of those people who write long author's note at the beginning, but even then, I'm fully aware that most people are just going to skip over it. So, I do whatever I can to grab their attention before they try to skip: I put it in FAQ form. In *bold letters*, if I have to.

For example:

*Why did Sirius forgive Dumbledore?*

Because Sirius blah blah blah. Etc.

Or, if it's just a minor detail like pairings, etc., I put it in the summary if it fits. Even then, there will still be people who don't read it.

For your case, though, it would be best if you try to work that explanation into your story somehow (preferably right around the time Sirius meets Dumbledore. Try to insert Sirius' thoughts here so your readers know /why/ Sirius decided not to bring up the Dursleys). Because I can almost guarantee that if you put it anywhere else, people aren't going to read it.
