Some do, some don't. That's really all you can say.

I typically keep mine to a minimum, but I have been told that my 'extra-canon-context' authors notes, which I employ in some of my stories in order to explain aspects of lore which are not fundamental to understanding the story, but which could be considered easter eggs for people with more knowledge.

For example, if I introduce a character who is mentioned in a minor role in some ancillary content I will not explain that in story text, as it's irrelevant, but I do mention it in the AN just so people who are aware of these things can make the connection. I also will explain some aspects of setting metaphysics in order to explain crossover mechanics. Again, these are not fundamentally important to the story, but fanfic readers like to understand and even feel like a participant in the fan construction, so including that stuff is liked by many.

However, many also simply do not read ANs. This is especially true of people who hold strong views as to the way things /should/ be. They are unlikely to care for your reasoning, and will instead start composing their angry review at the very moment you fall afoul of their closely held beliefs. There is really nothing you can do to placate these people, so I'd suggest you don't bother.

Others, of course, will engage with the story purely as a story. Many of these people also will not read ANs as they're simply not part of the story. These people usually don't leave the angry reviews, though, because part of engaging with a story on its own merits is accepting author autonomy and mastery within the bounds of their story. These people might have closely held beliefs, but they're typically willing to take a live and let live approach to things that don't conform to their expectations.
