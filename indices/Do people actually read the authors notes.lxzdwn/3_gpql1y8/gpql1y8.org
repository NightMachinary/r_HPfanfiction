I personally don't, but I don't really go off on people for writing what they want to write, I came here to read, not to be a Karen- but if it's something one of my friends wrote, I'm definitely reading every single word and helping out with spelling (by googling words I'm not sure on how to spell) and if I'm actually going to leave criticism, I make sure to read it again, because I honestly don't want the author to get that /“oh-no-I-fucked-up-on-the-internet”/ and then be wrong, lol- I try to only give pointers and criticism, but only if I pretty much know that they are true and/or helpful!
