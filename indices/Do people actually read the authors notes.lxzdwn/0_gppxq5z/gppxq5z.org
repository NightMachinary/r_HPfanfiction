I think some do and some don't. I try to assume people don't and include all the really important information in the chapters themselves. I use the Author's Notes for extra stuff mostly. That being said, I couldn't agree more about hate reviews. Especially ones that just say that they don't like the premise of the story. Constructive criticism is fine, but if your comment is rude and/or about something the author definitely isn't going to change (like the main pairing or the plot) then...just don't read it. (Sorry, I also needed to rant a bit)

Just ignore the haters. Write what you want to write.
