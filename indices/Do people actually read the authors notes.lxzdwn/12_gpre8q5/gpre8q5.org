As a general rule, IMO the best A/Ns are those that elaborate on extra stuff that isn't relevant for the story per se, but that could enhance the reading experience for those people who are interested. The only fic where I actually read the A/Ns religiously was a fic where the notes placed various story events into historical context. It was a fic set in the 70s, and the A/Ns elaborated on anything from an especially bad storm or a music concert, to historical monuments encountered in the story, and were always a treat to read IMO.

However, never should an A/N substitute a critical story detail. It should always be possible to fully enjoy a story without paying attention to author notes whatsoever.
