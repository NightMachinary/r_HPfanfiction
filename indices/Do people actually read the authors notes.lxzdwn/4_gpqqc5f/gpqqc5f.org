Depends. I would suggest you don't explain your stories in the author's note but try to contain all necessary information within the body of the story.

As for haters... sorry. It's just how it is when you put yourself out there. Just pat yourself on the back that you actually have the balls to put yourself out there with something creative and original while they just leave hateful comments under the pretense of anonymity. Good luck!
