Mixed. There's been some author's notes that have really interesting information about character design or plot, and I'll even return to past chapters to make sure I'm not missing anything interesting. A majority of the time I glance, skim, and skip. I'll read forewords and afterwords, but keeping things simple is my preference. I do like some definitions at the end of the chapter if you're using another language or referencing something really obscure.

What I used to like, but have grown out of, is characters talking to the audience for a disclaimer. It was "the thing" but kind of a relief to lose, even if I did it in the beginning!
