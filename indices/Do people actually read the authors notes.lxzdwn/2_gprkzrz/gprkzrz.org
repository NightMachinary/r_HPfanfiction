Personally, always. I enjoy the little peeks into personalities that author notes give. It's nice to get insights into the headspace of the author as they're writing, even if the fact that they've recently graduated or been having family issues is completely irrelevant to the fic itself.

I know a LOT of people don't. It's kind of a thing in the fandom. Understandably irritating from a writer's perspective, but also understandably done from a reader's perspective.
