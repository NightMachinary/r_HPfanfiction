  Hermione has the whole of Hogwarts lining up to bully her (incidentally bashing Ron for no good reason [2]), and is portrayed as someone passive, easily reduced to tears by Draco (who is described as "handsome" in her internal monologue), who really just wants to fall in love with a good, strong man who will treat her right and protect her. Enter that man: Harry, the White Knight, begins to Defend her Honuor, humiliating those who had bullied her; and in the meantime, one of the girls who had previously ostracised her foresaw (Divination-like) that she needed to get on Hermione's good side and started acting her friend. So, thanks to her Knight in Shining Armour, Hermione is "saved", but not through any actions or decisions of her own: she has no agency at all.

An internet nerd has a white knight fantasy? Heaven forbid.
