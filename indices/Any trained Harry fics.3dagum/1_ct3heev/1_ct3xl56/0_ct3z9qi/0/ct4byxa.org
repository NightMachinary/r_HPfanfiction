To say that something is "realistic" is meaningless in a fictional setting where the author controls all, or almost all, aspects of it. It's possible to contrive things so that practically /anything/ is realistic, especially if the setting allows for things like mind control. [1] Fundamentally, my problem with this fic --- and why I consider it to be a degrading portrayal of Hermione --- is the specific choice by the fic's author to

- "optimise" his interpretation of Hermione's character and talents, and his decisions about the extrinsic circumstances that affect her development, towards making her as pitiful and beaten-down as possible; while

- "optimise" his interpretation of Harry's character and talents, and his decisions about the extrinsic circumstances that affect his development, towards making him as strong and as confident (in everything but, perhaps, social subtleties) as possible.

To that end, as of Chapter 1, Hermione has the whole of Hogwarts lining up to bully her (incidentally bashing Ron for no good reason [2]), and is portrayed as someone passive, easily reduced to tears by Draco (who is described as "handsome" in her internal monologue), who really just wants to fall in love with a good, strong man who will treat her right and protect her. Enter that man: Harry, the White Knight, begins to Defend her Honuor, humiliating those who had bullied her; and in the meantime, one of the girls who had previously ostracised her foresaw (Divination-like) that she needed to get on Hermione's good side and started acting her friend. So, thanks to her Knight in Shining Armour, Hermione is "saved", but not through any actions or decisions of her own: she has no agency at all.

--------------

And, the saddest cut of all, the author didn't /have/ to do that to set up a romance of this type.

A telling plot point in Hermione's "development" in that fic was that she did, for all her beaten-downness, end up dating Krum for much of her fourth year; and at the end, it turned out that he was just using her, which broke her heart. The author chose to use that relationship to further degrade and weaken her (while, incidentally, bashing Krum), further underscoring the whole "waiting for a good man to treat her right and protect her" (not an actual quote from the fic) theme.

He could have, with equal or greater plausibility chosen to have Krum (who hexed a dragon in the face) end up teaching Hermione enough about duelling to give as good, or better, as she gets, even when outnumbered. (I.e., Hermione knows a lot of spells, including combat spells, but she is not a natural at duelling like Harry, so someone needed to show her how to use them effectively and to give her a chance to practice.) The relationship could then fail to work out for other reasons.

The result would be that at the beginning of the fifth year, Hermione is still ostracised (because many people now think that she is too vicious and scary), some teachers worry about her going Dark, and she still didn't make Gryffindor Prefect (because she had to get in trouble several times to establish herself as a costly target), so she is still bitter and lonely, but no longer in need of a White Knight but a friend and an ally.

[1] On the other hand, to say that something is "unrealistic" is not meaningless, since one can argue that the setting is internally inconsistent, but I am not arguing that for the moment.

[2] What a lot of people miss about Ron is that he is not a bully, or, at the very least, he was most certainly not bullying Hermione when he called her a "nightmare". In fact, /he/ justifiably considered himself a victim of Hermione's hectoring and condescension. He was expressing his frustration to Harry, did not mean for Hermione to overhear him, and immediately regretted saying what he had said when he realised that Hermione had overheard him. Neither is Hermione this wilting flower. We don't need to speculate how she responds to bullying and adversity, because we know how she does it from canon: she lectures, she shouts, she punches, she sets people on fire, she blackmails, she curses, she lures into a trap.

If Ron had actually tried to bully her, he would have quickly brought out her vicious and vindictive side. The reason he go to her is that she actually considered him a friend at the time --- after all their shared experiences --- only to suddenly discover that she had been antagonising them all along, and (probably) having no clue exactly what she'd been doing wrong. /That's/ something to cry about.
