If they were killed when I was a baby, before I had a chance to get to know them at all, I probably wouldn't give a shit. My ability to feel emotional connections to real people has been mostly worn away over the years thanks to a variety of mental health problems and childhood trauma. Most people are just distractions from my coping mechanisms now.

A Harry with no hero complex, who's too detached to care, sounds interesting. I'd read the shit out of it as long as the pairings aren't too creepy (i.e. Harry/Death Eater, Harry/Voldemort, Harry/someone from his parents' generation).
