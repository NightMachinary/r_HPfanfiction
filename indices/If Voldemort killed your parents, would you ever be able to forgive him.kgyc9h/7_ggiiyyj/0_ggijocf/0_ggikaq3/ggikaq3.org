Pretty much. So I can see why a harry who grew up with being told his (or in your case her) parents where drunks and all the other negative stuff the Dursleys said wouldnt be attached to their parents or mad at the dark Lord. I could see them being mad at them being made an orphan and making them live with the Dursleys but that's not all Voldy's fault. Harry should have been raised by Sirius but the ministry didnt give him a trial so it could be quite easy for harry to put the blame for him being with the Dursleys on the ministry and not Voldemort.

Honestly I dont mind harry forgiving the dark Lord as long as it makes sense for that character to forgive Voldy.
