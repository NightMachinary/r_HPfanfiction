So Harry/your Harry never knew his parents. Think of the life he was robbed because of it. In DH canon he thinks about how he could have had siblings, friends over... I mean he wouldn't have been left with the Dursleys. He wouldn't feel so alone in the world particularly after Sirius and Dumbledore die. He wouldn't have needed Molly/Arthur to be substitute parents. Yes Harry wound up with all these amazing friends and people who care about him but it's not the same.
