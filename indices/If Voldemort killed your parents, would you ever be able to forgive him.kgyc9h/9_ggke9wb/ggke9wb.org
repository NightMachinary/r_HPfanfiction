As an apathetic person, no. And the proof of his sanity would just make her angry because if Voldy is capable of being sane and not wanting to murder her, then why did he kill her family all those years ago. If she were somewhat sociopathic or unemotional ig she still wouldn't *forgive* him, and would probably also be a very angry person in general and he Is the root of all of her problems. Abused children often fixate on their families, see Tom finding and killing his only relatives and starting a eugenics movement, Sirius' obsession with his family and how much he talks about them, so your character would have no reason to Dislike her parents and no way to justify Voldemort's actions unless she acted very OOC and is so different than them that she'd have reason to murder her own parents
