I probably wouldn't. However a forgiving Harry is a very in-character Harry. He forgives the Dursleys and all it takes is for him is for Dudley to say a few kind words and for Vernon to make an awkward attempt at farewell. He forgives Draco and all it takes for him is to take some pity in the latter in the RoR. He forgives Snape and all it takes is for him to find out that Snape was in love with his mother. Hell he even offers Voldemort a chance at redemption before the final duel. So a forgiving Harry is very in-character.
