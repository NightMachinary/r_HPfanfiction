I would find such a character to be unlikeable. Unrealistic, too, since orphaned children tend to fixate on parents, but you can argue that perhaps your genderbent Harry reacts differently, okay. But unlikeable, yes. And other people should also find that unlikeable because someone who doesn't CARE that someone flat out MURDERED her family is....not endearing.
