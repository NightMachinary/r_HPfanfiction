To be fair, I could see it. If it's in her character not to care, it's only logical. But especially if she's more focused on survival ; if he's sane and not going after her or her friends, why would she creates her own demise ? Even insane, Voldemort is up there with Dumbledore, in term of danger. Harry would have no chance against a sane one before her/his maturity, wouldn't s/he? Even if she wants revenge, as long as no one is in danger, she'd probably wait. And in the meantime, well, she could forgive or forget. (And i mean, look at Neville in canon : he's in quite the same situation and he does nothing until the very end. If Harry isn't pushed into the early adventures, he could too lead a normal life until he has to take a stand)

Also, I would like to say that I wouldn't find such a character unlikable just based on that. Especially if the character is actually apathetic etc. New outlook are always interesting!
