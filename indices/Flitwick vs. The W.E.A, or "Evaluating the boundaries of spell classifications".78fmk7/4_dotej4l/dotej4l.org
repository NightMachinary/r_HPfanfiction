Transfiguration is the branch of magic that changes the nature and appearance of the object. Ie a ant into a lion, or conjuring.

Charms seems to be a class that teaches most every form of magic, with a lean towards utility.

I know this wont go over well. Stop listening to Rowling. Unless its published, its at best minor canon, at least when it comes to magic itself.

Rowling stated in the books that second years learn the incedio charm. Yet we see harry and co learn the aquamenti charm in 6th year. (obviously for plot but) In my mind, the incendio charm doesnt shoot flames so much as it set things alight.\\
The aquamenti charm creates water.

The reason these two charms are taught in charms and not transfiguration is complexity. You arent conjuring a lion. You are conjuring a stream of water. Flitwick is better suited to that than Minerva.
