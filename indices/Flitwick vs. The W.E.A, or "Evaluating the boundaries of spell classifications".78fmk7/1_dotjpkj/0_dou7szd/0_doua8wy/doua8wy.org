I was referring to the part in the book of spells where it says that those who are not pure of heart get eaten alive by maggots if they try to cast the patronus charm. I think Rowling (or whoever vetted it) forgot that Umbridge could cast one. So when it was pointed out there was a rather sketchy in my opinion explanation why it wasn't a mistake.
