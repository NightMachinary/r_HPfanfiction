Charms have an effect upon appearance and behaviour, while transfiguration have an effect upon nature.\\
Conjuration is changing "nothing" into "something", thus making it transfiguration.\\
The aguamenti spell is (incorrectly) classified as a charm because most others water-making spells use the ambient humidity, and because fire-making spells change the behaviour of something from "I'm not burning" to "finally I'm burning". Aguamenti is in fact a conjuration, but it was classified as a charm more than 2 thousand years ago and no one has performed to change this since.\\
Why, you tell me? Because there is an ancient debate regarding the nature of banishment : is it a transfiguration from "something" to "nothing" or a charm between "here" and "not here"? As long as masters of transfiguration will affirm banishment is a transfiguration, masters of charms will keep water-conjuring spells as charms.\\
It's the same (if quite more heated) as the debate between centaurs and humans : is astronomy a part of divination, or divination a part of astronomy?
