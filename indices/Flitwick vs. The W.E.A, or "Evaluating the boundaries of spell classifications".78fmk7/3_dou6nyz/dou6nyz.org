My view on things is that spell names are very largely vernacular. Wizards just /use/ them in a way that sorta-kinda-makes-sense, and then Ministry-sanctioned scholars /try/ to make up arbitrary, somewhat pedantic classifications based on the vernacular terms but they don't really /mean/ anything. Conjuration is only part of Transfiguration as a shorthand so that it can be taught as part of the Hogwarts Transfiguration curriculum, and because it looked close enough to transfiguration for the likes of Percy to give it a go-ahead. The Bird-Conjuring Charm is called that because that's how the man who created it started calling it, even if it doesn't make any sense. Even the Patronus Charm doesn't really fit the 'official' description of a Charm (it doesn't change anything's properties, it /creates/ something; if anything it's Conjuration), but "Patronus Charm" had a nice ring to it and that's how people started calling it.
