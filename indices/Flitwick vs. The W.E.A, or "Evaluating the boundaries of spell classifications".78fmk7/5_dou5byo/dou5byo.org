I think it's clear that there are two forms of animation, one within the school of Charms and one within Transfiguration. We've seen students make objects move under their own power in Charms (e.g. making a pineapple dance) but we've also seen Transfiguration used to give inanimate objects life (e.g. McGonagall's chess set).

With animation I think the distinction is in magical nature, not appearance. When you use Transfiguration to animate, you're giving the object the power of movement - from that moment on, the object has that power intrinsically. It is no longer an inanimate object but an animate one. In Charms, however, you're overlaying a fairly narrowly defined behaviour onto the object which remains reliant on the wizard for continual maintenance and direction. It remains an inanimate object in nature, albeit an enchanted one. While the functional result might be similar in most situations, I imagine there will be times where the difference in magical nature leads to different results when interacting with other magic.

I think the same can be applied to Conjuration by analogy. It's possible in both Charms and Transfiguration, but they are different in nature. Transfiguration conjuration would make objects that are physically identical to the real thing, but not magically identical (being composed of non-being and therefore ultimately disappearing). Charms Conjuration, on the other hand, would make a magical construct of the object, a kind of tactile illusion.
