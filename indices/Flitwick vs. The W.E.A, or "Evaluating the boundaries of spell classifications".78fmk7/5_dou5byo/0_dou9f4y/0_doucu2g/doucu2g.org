It would make sense that the water charm isn't conjuring water, but instead condenses it from the air, or possibly summons it from a nearby location. We know you can't conjure food, and yet on at least one occasion we see Molly Weasley use magic while cooking to apparently conjure sauce, the latter is my best explanation for how that works.
