My headcanon about the last point:

- Jinxes, hexes, and curses are classified by effect.

- Jinxes are minor annoyances, and easily undone.

- Hexes have a more debilitating effect, and require specific counter-hexes.

- Curses are the dark magic that scars and kills, requiring very specific counter-curses to cancel their effects, with additional treatment required afterward, if the curse doesn't kill outright. (See Septumsempra)
