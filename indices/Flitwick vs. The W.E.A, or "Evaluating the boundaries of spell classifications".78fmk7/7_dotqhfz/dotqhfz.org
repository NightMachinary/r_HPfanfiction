My headcanon is that:

- transfiguration involves infusing magic into things to create a gestalt object with different properties. The higher levels involve direct application of will and magic, specific spells that do exactly one type of thing to exactly one other type of thing are extremely limited and only really useful as learning tools to achieve that level.

- alchemy is using magic to rearrange matter (rearrange water into hydrogen and oxygen as a simple example)

- charms is a catch-all class term for castable magics.

- The various categories of spells (for example, jinx, curse, hex) are arbitrary, based on [public/Ministry] opinion and are not rigorous.
