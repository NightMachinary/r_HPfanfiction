In the Transfiguration section:

#+begin_quote
  [Conclusion] 1: Transfiguration works in a different way to Charms because it fundamentally alters the properties of the object of the spell (from [Observation] 1).
#+end_quote

Conclusions 41, 42, and 43 specifically deal with the crossover between Charms and Transfiguration.

In short, charms can create potable water and transfiguration cannot (because that would make it /not/ an exception to Gamp's Law).

I /believe/ the flame whip is a transfiguration (Taure is also unsure on this), and Incendio is a charm. I've always visualized Incendio as a standard spell-projectile-thing that lit whatever it hit on fire, not something that changed whatever it hit into fire nor something that acted like a flamethrower. (Anyone know which is canon?)

I recommend reading the whole document if you're going to think about HP magic.
