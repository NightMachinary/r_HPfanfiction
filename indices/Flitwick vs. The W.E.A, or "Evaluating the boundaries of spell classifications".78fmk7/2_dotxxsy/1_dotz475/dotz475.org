I'm very familiar with Taure's headcanon (or at least however much of it has been codified), and I largely agree with his conclusions, but something about /Conjuring/ water that is, for all intents and purposes, physically indistinguishable from its counterpart doesn't sit right with me. Maybe it's not subject to the effects of temperature, pressure, etc., or maybe it'll simply disappear after a while? I just don't know!
