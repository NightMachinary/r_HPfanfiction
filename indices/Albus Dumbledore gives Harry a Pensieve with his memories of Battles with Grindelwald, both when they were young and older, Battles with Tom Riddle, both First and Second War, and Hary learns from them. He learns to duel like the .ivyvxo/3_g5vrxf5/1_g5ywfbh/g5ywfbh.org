Feels a bit like in Wind Shear where an older Harry is in the past (Bellatrix is in 6th or 7th year) and he battles Voldermort transforming the terrain around and animating things. At one point he make a dirt/stone dragon to swallow Voldermort's Fiendfyre and spit it back at him. One of the best fight I ever read.
