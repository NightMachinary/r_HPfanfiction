"I've learnt from the best and, the worst Tom, don't make me do this!" Harry screamed at the monster in front of him.

Voldemort stared at Harry, his eyes glowed with a furious red gleam. Then he spoke, his voice low and quiet. "You underestimate my power." It was a statement, not a boast, and not an exaggeration. He spoke with conviction, with full confidence in his words.

Harry did not try to convince the beast in front of him to lay down his arms any further. His eyes now held resignation of what he had to do. Harry whipped out his wand in front of him and, not a moment later a red beam of light shot out.

Voldemort disintegrated the spell in front of him and, shot out his own. It was not like the mans in front of him, Voldemort's spell reeked death and hate.

The world started to warp around Harry as he began to spread his magic outwards, forcing the world around him to bend to his will. The ground slithered and transformed into mythical beasts, the air crackled with power, and Harry was the center of a storm. Wind and fire sheared around him in a circular fashion as he blocked the various spells thrown at him.

Voldemort growled out in frustration as the little lamb turned out to not be so little anymore. With a grasping motion Voldemort overpowered Harry's control over the earth and, instead forced the ground to violently rip towards his opponent. Encasing him in a cocoon of dirt.

Errr, it could go something like this. I do not write anything so the stuff above is super rough.

I did not like where it was going or how it was being written so I stopped mid-way.

But I hope that this little bit could give one or two people some inspiration.
