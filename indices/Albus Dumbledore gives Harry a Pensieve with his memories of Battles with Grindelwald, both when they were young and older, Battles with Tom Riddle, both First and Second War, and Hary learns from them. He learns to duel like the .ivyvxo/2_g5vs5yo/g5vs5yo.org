Imagine dueling is like playing Starcraft. Instead of mastering computers, it evenly learning all RTS games, like Dumbledore, Harry just grinds Starcraft.

By 15, he has a real shot at being a world class duelist. He cant transfigure flowers to save his life, but turning a huge chunk of floor into ice or lava is easy. He knows of household charms, but he is pants at them.

Sensing, reacting, aiming, willing, timing, and powering spells is what Harry knows. Take your plants and potions and history and what to do against grindylows and stuff it.
