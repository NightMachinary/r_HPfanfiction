i recall a story somewhat similar to this premise, though i don't remember the name of the story or author. basically, Dumbledore didn't rely on pure dumb luck to make sure things turned out well after his death.

he has Fawkes find harry, and with some type of ritual that included the Elder Wand and Fawkes making Harry bleed, gave Harry all of Dumbledore's knowledge.
