Sorry you aren't having luck in replies. I'll chime in with a question

I vaguely recall a story where Sirius kinda is a ghost/apparition (or maybe just in Harry's head) after he fell into the veil, and his ties to Harry keep him around, and eventually allow him to get free. I don't remember a coma, but it's been a while.

Any chance its that fic? Otherwise I can't help, since the only coma fics I recall involve Hermione.
