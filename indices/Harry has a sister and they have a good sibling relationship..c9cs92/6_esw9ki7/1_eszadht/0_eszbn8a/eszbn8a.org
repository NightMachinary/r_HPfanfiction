It's unfinished and was on hiatus for months, recently started updating again but I already forgot a lot of the story and have to reread parts when new chapters get released.

The author finished his other main story The Arithmancer just recently, so now the Animagus is updating again. I highly recommend reading The Arithmancer, it's got a really well made spellcrafting aspect.
