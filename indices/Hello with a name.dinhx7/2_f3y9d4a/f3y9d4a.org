Nymphadora means 'given by nymphs.' So I could see a younger sister having either A) a plain Muggle name, as Ted gets to pick one, or B) a name following the same tradition, or C) a constellation name like the rest of the Blacks.

So you might have Sarah or Amelia, or you could have a ridiculous Greek mashup name, like Agatheleuke or Raisaphilana, or a constellation like Lyra or Sagitta.

Personally, I think the Muggle name would be more likely, since Tonks would have been old enough to express discontent with her name by the time your OC was born.

You might want to elaborate on her personality or role, since name-seers are a thing in canon.
