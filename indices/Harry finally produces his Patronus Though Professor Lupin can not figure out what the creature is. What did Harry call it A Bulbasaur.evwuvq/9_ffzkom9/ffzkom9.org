This made me think of a story called Thinking in Little Green Boxes, by DireSquirrell. in which Harry summons a Pikachu by creating a potion. with a gang of pikachu later robbing Gringotts on his orders. with the help of a Basilisk. that Harry caught with a Pokeball.

the basic premise of the story is that Harry is raised by Deadpool. it's pretty much abandoned at this point, but still, an entertaining read.
