Theoretically. Tonk's patronus changes to Moony. Werewolves aren't natural creatures, so that's canon a patronus doesn't need to be a natural animal.

However the problem I see it the caster's state of mind. I could see a child using accidental magic to summon a ninja turtle patronus to kick a dementor's ass. But I think it'd be an exceptionally immature adult wizard to see a cartoon character as their protection.

I think it's all about intent and 'Magic' picks the form best suited. When learning the patronus Harry spent hours listening to his mother an father being murdered, protecting him. This was in the back of his mind, his parents protecting him. So when he eventually managed a corporal patronus, Magic, chose the form of James as his protector. I've been toying with the idea that as Harry gets older and has kids, his patronus changes to HIS animagus form. As he sees himself as the protector now.
