  The first time that Harry met Tony Stark he was just about to close his little bakery shop, Bite Sized. The second time Stark came to the bakery he brought along a pretty redhead that had a phone stuck to her ear and seemed to be trying to placate someone on the other end of the phone. Tony/Harry. Slash. Drabbley.

  Harry stared out the Dursely car window morosely. 'I would have went with Sirius if he had asked.' He thought. 'I would have run from the law and Durselys with him.' He paused, blinking. 'I could do that on my own! I could run away' Summer after 3rd year
