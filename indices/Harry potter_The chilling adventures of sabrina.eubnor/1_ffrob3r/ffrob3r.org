What about, Harry is the Master of Death, as such is an equal to the Dark Lord as a celestial being. He arrives in the Sabrinaverse and takes pleasure in helping Sabrina and her cohort go against the Dark Lord. He knows how heavy a prophecy can be on one's shoulder and decides to help. I would love a gay, flirty, and cocky Harry but I could settle for only cocky and flirty. I would just laugh so much reading about Harry calling the Dark Lord “hot stuff”.
