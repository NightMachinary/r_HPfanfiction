Absolutely loved Part 1. Part 2 was great in parts, but also had some real cringe moments. Haven't seen Part 3 yet.

Back when Part 1 aired, I put some brief thought into how I would do a crossover.

*Dimension/time travel*

Harry gets magically dumped into the Sabrinaverse, which is a separate universe to his own. I think this would work best with a late-teens Harry, maybe HBP or DH, or immediately post-DH.

Harry/Sabrina romance, and lots of fun "fish out of water" moments for Harry, both in terms of his tagging along to attend a Muggle American high school in 2018 (smartphones just keep breaking every time he touches them), and in terms of Sabrina-verse magic working very differently to his own. And reverse "fish out of water" moments when Sabrinaverse witches are stunned by some of Harry's magical abilities.

*Fusion fic*

In this, the Sabrinaverse is just how Americans practice magic in the HP universe.

I think the only change that would be absolutely necessary to make this work would be to be more ambiguous about the Christian/Satanic mythology behind the magic i.e. don't show Satan on screen, and have most non-American wizards scoff at the idea that Satan exists. Probably this "Satan" is just a particularly powerful heliopath, they say.

Other than that change, obviously American magic functions quite differently to the HP magic we know, but they're not so far apart that you can't imagine them existing in the same world. Some of the core mechanics - like the lack of exhaustion, but the existence of varying power between witches and warlocks - are quite similar.

A plot line that presents itself is that Harry arrives at the Academy of the Unseen Arts to teach a course as a kind of guest teacher.

If you really wanted to, you could still write this as Harry/Sabrina, but you'd have to tackle the age difference. Probably from Sabrina's side it doesn't matter - I doubt the Church of the Night has much of a problem with teacher-student relationships or age differences. It's Harry who's the real problem....
