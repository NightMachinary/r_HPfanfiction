As a happy humble Hufflepuff I can say that I would love to be able to create new charms and ways around the house. I love sewing and would love to have magic to make everything so much easier! I'm sure their are spell casters in the ministry and that would be the life for me. Home by 5 in time for dinner with the family :)
