I've always been a straight A student, so at least on essays I'll probably be good, and maybe in stuff like potions or herbology, where you need more attention to detail and knowledge and less "power". I have no idea what my "raw power" will be like though. I'll probably live in the library for the entire 7 years, knowing me.
