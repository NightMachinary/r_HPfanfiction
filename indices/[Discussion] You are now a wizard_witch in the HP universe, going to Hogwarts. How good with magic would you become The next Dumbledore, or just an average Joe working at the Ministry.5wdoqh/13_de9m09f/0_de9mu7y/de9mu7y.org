The good news is that "raw power" isn't to be found in canon, belonging in the same place as magical cores and "so mote it be", so it's not really a limitation. If you were a straight-A student, you'd probably end up around Hermione or Percy level in subjects other than Divination and DADA, which would probably depend more on your personality.
