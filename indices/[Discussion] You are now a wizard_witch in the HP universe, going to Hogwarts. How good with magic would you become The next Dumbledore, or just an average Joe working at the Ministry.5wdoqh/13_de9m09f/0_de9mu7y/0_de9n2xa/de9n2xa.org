I'm not sure though, because even though Hermione is much smarter than Harry, he does tend to be able to do the difficult spells easier than her. He can do a patronus in his third year, one strong enough to drive off a hundred dementors. It might be all a matter of will power, but it might not. There are a lot of old wizards and witches, but only one Dumbledore, and it can't be solely because he read and practiced more than other people. Just like there are people that are naturally more athletic - I can practice 10 hours a day but I'll never be a professional athlete - it stands to reason that magical power is also a "talent" of sort.
