The gist I always got from the books (and I may be completely wrong) is that there is: 1. talent/power - which defines how powerful your spells would be and what's the maximum "cap" of the spells you can perform, and this is what makes Dumbledore and Voldemort and even Harry different. Then there's 2. understanding/intelligence - the ability to grasp complex spells, the nuances of wand movement, the right pronunciation, etc. This is what Hermione has in in spades. I guess reading a lot and accruing knowledge would also come into play here. Then there's 3. aptitude - different people are suited to different magic - Lily to charms, James to transfiguration, Harry to DADA, Neville to herbology, etc. This may be due to personality, to interest, or to an innate "form" of magic. Hermione could brew a polyjuice potion in her second year, but could she invent a whole new potion, like a potion master could? I don't know.

So I always thought how "good" a witch or wizard you were depended on all three (taking into account that you have a suited wand and so on). Not everyone can be as powerful as Dumbledore, since his "cap" is very high. But if he didn't study at all, and took no time to practice, and was generally very lax about his studies, then someone like Hermione might outpace him. Harry, for example, is generally a pretty lazy student. Hermione gets the spells right before him, and she knows a lot more spells. But when he does study and understand the spells, his spells are much more powerful then hers - he summoned his broom from the castle in the tournament, he repelled a hundred dementors with a patronus.

So yeah, that's my two cents.
