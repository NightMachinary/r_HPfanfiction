  I'm not sure though, because even though Hermione is much smarter than Harry, he does tend to be able to do the difficult spells easier than her.

What examples are there other than the Patronus?

  He can do a patronus in his third year, one strong enough to drive off a hundred dementors. It might be all a matter of will power, but it might not.

A number of people only a year or two older than Harry was in PoA were able to learn to cast a corporeal patronus in DA in two sessions (if my memory is correct). Of course, this was under ideal circumstances --- a comfortable room, surrounded by friends. They (Hermione in particular) had trouble casting a Patronus at a Dementor in the Ministry, though she eventually managed it. Since Dementors drain the very emotions needed to cast a Patronus, I think there's strong evidence that the magical ability to cast a Patronus is separate from the personality needed to cast and sustain a strong one in the face of a large number of Dementors. Harry, in particular, with his ability to keep his head under fire and characterized as wearing his his heart on his sleeve, is able to easily muster right feelings once he knows what they are; whereas a perpetual worrier like Hermione would falter, because how can she rejoice without reservation in a world where house-elves are enslaved, blood and money mean more than truth and hard work, and people always wait until the last minute to do their homework unless you nag them, and often not even then? ;)

Also worth noting is that when Harry cast his great Patronus in PoA, the Dementors were on the other side of the lake from him, focused on his past self, so he was outside their aura: he was casting on the "easy mode", and as long as they didn't spot him and he could sustain the right emotions (since wizards don't run out of magic), his Patronus could harass the Dementors as long as it took to chase them away.

  There are a lot of old wizards and witches, but only one Dumbledore, and it can't be solely because he read and practiced more than other people. Just like there are people that are naturally more athletic - I can practice 10 hours a day but I'll never be a professional athlete - it stands to reason that magical power is also a "talent" of sort.

I don't think there's particularly good evidence for magical power that's separate from general intelligence, personality, other non-magical traits, and even values. For those characters for whom we get to observe both, magical ability correlates very strongly with general intelligence mediated by personality: in short, we don't see any wizards or witches who are dumb or but powerful or smart but weak; and the overall magical ability of someone like Neville changes greatly over a fairly short period of time through practice and confidence. (Recall, Neville didn't get a new wand until the /end/ of OotP.) So, in the end, there's very little left for the "magical power" variable to explain.
