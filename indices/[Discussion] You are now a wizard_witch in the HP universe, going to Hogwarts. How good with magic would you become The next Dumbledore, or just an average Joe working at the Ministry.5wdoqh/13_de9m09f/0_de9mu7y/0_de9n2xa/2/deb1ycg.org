How is she "smarter"?

More driven maybe, more used to learning and studying (she probably got praise from her parents for doing well in school - Harry didn't get that! The Dursleys probably didn't like him doing well) and more of a bookworm, but smarter over all?

No, I don't think so (otherwise she'd ended up doing something with all her smarts like going into research etc.)

In a fight I'd think Harry would wipe the floor with her (until she decides which spell to use Harry has nailed her already!)
