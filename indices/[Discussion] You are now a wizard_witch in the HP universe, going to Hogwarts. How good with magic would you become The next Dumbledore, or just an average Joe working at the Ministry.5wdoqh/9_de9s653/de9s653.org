  The way I see it, most of us wouldn't reach that level.

But wouldn't you /want/ to? And really, what would stop anyone from trying?

The easy-to-abuse magic in the /Potter/ verse is part of the reason why it's so hard to write (or find) a crossover that doesn't break the other canon setting or characters. It's part of the reason that indy!Harry stories are so widespread -- canon Harry is frustratingly incurious about magic, and fics like that fill the niche.

But there's literally nothing stopping anyone from becoming vastly powerful in life or even mildly impressive at cocktail parties -- at least not any magical laws of nature (though those of magical Ministries might be a different story). If you have the willpower, the knowledge, the inclination, and, perhaps, at least a thimbleful of raw talent, it seems that you can accomplish a lot ... if you /want/ to.

Most characters in the series don't want to or don't even bother thinking to try, (and, frankly, that's part of the setting because it'd be a very different series if they did). Magic is treated as a mundane tool, not the physics-changing game-breaker that it is. Which is fine, because the /Potter/ verse is based in wonder and whimsical absurdities, not strictly ordered magical systems.

It's also the exact reason that I'd end up getting labeled a Dark Something-or-Other for wanting to maximize the potential of magic. Of course, I'd probably deserve that for min-maxing instead of properly roleplaying, but at least I'd have claimed Mars for all things magical.
