Exactly my kind of argument, you don't even have to study 24/7 (Hermione's approach to magic as a kind of science doesn't really work - it helps, but in the end that's not how it works for the most part! Your desire plays a huge role as does your confidence that your magic will obey your command - look at Neville, he's a true force of nature (well: Close to it, he's no Dumbledore but he's no slouch either!) after he overcomes his insecurities and confidence issues and he's not done a Hermione to study stuff all the time (except for herbology which is his passion and not strictly magic, it's a subject where knowledge really matters - just like potions, despite the fact that a persons confidence etc. also play a role here (otherwise muggles or squibs could be great at potions!)) in order to be great!

You have to have a passion for something - be it transfiguration (Dumbledore's main interest, we've not seen him use many impressive magics, but his animation charms (when fighting Voldemort at the ministry!) were great...hell, alchemy is a kind of transfiguration, too!), charms or in Harry's case: Defense against the dark arts!

If you have that then your practical spellwork will automatically be better than others (especially if your passion is supported by your need to know - Harry needs defense spells and stuff to survive so his desire/need and his passion (help others and defend himself!) line up here!)

So in the case of one of us:

Wouldn't our desire to learn magic (damned, the power to make even a tiny part of the universe bend to your will completely, even if it's just to break the rules of physics (like gravitation, to levitate a damn feather)? SIGN ME UP!), to show the purebloods (we'd all be muggleborns after all) and to be better than others make us at least better than average? I for one think so and going from there to something like Dumbledore (note: IMHO Dumbledore isn't that powerful, sure he knows a lot and has experience, but even he had to concede against multiple aurors when they tried to arrest him (Voldemort would have fought them and IMHO he is more powerful (maybe because he's insane?), but lacks experience - that's why Dumbledore can beat him, he knows Voldemort's tactics and knows how to fight someone more powerful and even then it's a close call, hell Fawkes the Phoenix has to intercept a killing curse if I remember correctly, otherwise Dumbledore would have been done for!))
