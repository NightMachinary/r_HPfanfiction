I would be slightly above average, but not too impressive. Hopefully a muggleborn, so I could get out of the wizarding world asap after Hogwarts, then start making crazy money exploiting loopholes. One idea I found fascinating in a fanfiction was when Harry decided to start fixing up old furniture with Reparo and selling it for millions. I would do stuff like that, and get rich!
