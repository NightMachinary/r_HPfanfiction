That's a very interesting question that I think is rather deeper than it first appears.

A point to consider before answering is what judges magical strength? In canon we're actually given very little that explains exactly why Dumbledore and Voldemort are on a different level to the rest of the population. Fanon has attempted to find solutions, be it magical cores or otherwise, but we don't know the reason. The most widely accepted reasoning is that knowledge is directly equal to power in the Wizarding World. If you read, memorize and, most crucially I think, understand every magical concept and spell then you should be the next Dumbledore. Right?

I'm not sure I fully agree with that theory. I think that magic by nature is a force that defies logic and can't be quantified. Sure knowledge helps, but how in touch you are with the magic coursing through your body, those kind of things are the most important in my mind. In canon a swish and a flick of a wand with a Latin incantation levitates a feather. However we know for a fact that isn't all that is happening, else why wouldn't muggles be able to do the same? No something is happening on another level, whether it's your intent directing a mystical force, or another reason entirely, something is happening beyond just applying the knowledge of what to do. There is something in the witch / wizard that causes reality to shift to their wishes.

To people like Dumbledore and Voldemort reality shifts on a whim. Magic is eager to fill every desire they have, to the point where they don't even need their wands and can achieve the impossible. What gives them that connection? Are they born that way or have they learnt it over their lives? We don't know.

So back to your question. If I woke up in a world of magic tomorrow with an owl giving my Hogwarts letter then I would throw everything I had into magic. Knowing that if I study for just an hour I could turn wood into metal, how could I not? That feeling would never end. I know myself well enough to say that.

The question was though would I ever reach Dumbledore's level? I'm not sure I can simply because I don't believe learning every fact in the Hogwarts library is what makes Dumbledore the wizard he is.

Thanks for this prompt, was a fun thought exercise, let me know your thoughts in return !
