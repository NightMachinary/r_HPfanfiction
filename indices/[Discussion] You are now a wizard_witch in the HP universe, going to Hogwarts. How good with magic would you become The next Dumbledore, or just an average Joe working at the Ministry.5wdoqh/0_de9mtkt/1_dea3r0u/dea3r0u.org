I like to think i know myself well enough to give a guess about what i'd do. Your assessment is close to me with one difference.

I jump from thing to thing as soon as i finish it, but i also stay in a theme for awhile too.

I'd probably end up doing my best to master whatever interested me most, but if it became especially frustrating without any progress i'd give up on it and move on to the next thing.

Harry Potter magic has always been so fucking cool to me because of it's ability to create literally everything.
