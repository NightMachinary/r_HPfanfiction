Yup, I agree with you. This prompt was mainly a response to all those "Harry should've spent 24/7 training so that he could fight Voldemort". Everytime I read those, it's pretty easy to put myself in Harry's place and think 'If I was Harry, I'd become Merlin by always studying!'.

A real word analog, would be somebody like Terence Tao. I could spend all day studying math but I doubt I could ever be better than him.

In the magical world, hard work and intellect helps, a lot. But, I think that some people developed faster (intellectually), or are better at thinking a certain way, which helps with magic. If Dumbledore and Voldemort were muggles, they would probably both be successful in their academic fields, or business.
