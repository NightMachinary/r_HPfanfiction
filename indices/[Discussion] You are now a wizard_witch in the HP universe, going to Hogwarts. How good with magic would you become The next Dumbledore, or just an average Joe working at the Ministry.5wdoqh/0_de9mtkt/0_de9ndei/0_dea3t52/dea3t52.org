The thing that defines Harry, Dumbledore, and Voldemort is a truly emotional makeup. Dumbledore and Voldemort are both extremely well educated, and have knowledge of spells most other wizards and witches do not, but they have real true beliefs about things. Dumbledore is incredibly strong willed about what he believes is right.

Harry while being very inexperienced is able to compete up to a point on the sheer magnitude of his ability to really feel. His Patronus being a good example, his failure at the Cruciatus is another as well.

Hermione who is very clever and can learn spells very quickly, but Harry is always shown to be able to perform at a higher level than her, largely because his practical work really touches the semantic and emotional makeup of magic. Not that Hermione is not a powerful witch, cause she is, she's clever and when she gets wound up, she's quite scary.

Ron is shown as powerful in the books as well, and we know that Ron is a pretty emotional dude. That ability to feel evocatively, to express that feeling into the world is shown in very high regard in the novels. Look how poorly Ravenclaws are panned to get an idea of this, even Hermione is bashed in canon for being too much books and cleverness.

Tonks is shown to be negatively effected by her emotional makeup after Sirius, Neville is shown to struggle a great deal, and not just because of a bad wand match, but his lack of confidence make his spellcasting pretty bad.

Ginny is implied to be powerful, and she's another person who has a strong emotional makeup. Draco is shown to be topsy turvy, largely probably because of his inability to know what he really wants. Crab and Goyle are shown to be pretty shit wizards, they are emotionally vacant and dumb to boot.

Basically emotional integrity grants power, Voldemort may be psycho, but his insanity fuels his magic for sure.

Then take a look at the Unforgiveable's. You really have to believe something horrible for them to work. It can't just be, you kind of want them to do something for the Imperio. You truly have to want to completely and utterly dominate them, you have to truly hate to cast the Avada, you have to truly desire the persons suffering for the Cruciatus.

This ability to feel, and express is tied pretty intrinsically to so much magic in the books.

TL;DR: Studying would absolutely help Harry. Probably a whole ton, but its not what makes Harry powerful, its his beliefs, his certainty, and his care.
