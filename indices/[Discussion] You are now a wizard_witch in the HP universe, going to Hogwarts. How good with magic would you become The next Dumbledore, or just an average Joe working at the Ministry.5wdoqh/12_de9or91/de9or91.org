I think I would be like Fred and George not really caring about the grades but still be talented . I would probably be good at potion and herbiology but my essays would most defiantly be quite average( Im like that in biology and chemistry). I would pretty good at transfiguration, defense and charms because they work quite well with my mindset. I would suck at History and Astronomy. Overall I think I would only study what Interest Me and would be usefull in The Future and just get by with my grades. As profession I would create magical objects like Fred and George but I would focus one more use full day to day application
