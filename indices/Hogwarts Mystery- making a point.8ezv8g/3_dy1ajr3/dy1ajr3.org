I totally see what you mean, but I actually enjoy the game. I don't mind the wait times, I enjoy playing it when I have a few spare minutes, I enjoy the look and the music, it's laid back and easy and about my favorite books, it's a story to follow, etc. I really enjoy the "no pressure" feeling I get from playing it. The choices you make don't matter much and I get to explore a pretty 3D world and follow an adventure whenever I want. Though I didn't really follow any announcement while it was still in development so I had absolutely no idea how it was going to be, which is probably why I'm just happy with the game as it is.
