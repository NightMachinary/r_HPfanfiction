That's the thing. I have no problem actually spending money on games, when I like them. But I will *not* spend a bloody dime on such a ridiculous game model, and neither should anyone. Releasing a game for a flat price, or making so you can play, but paying just helps things a bit- yes. Cosmetic microtransactions- okay. But making it practically impssible to enjoy the experience without paying, while at the same time trying to pass under the guise of a free game, isn't something I'll ever stand behind.
