I love it and Hate it for that exact reason. I will continue playing but to expect anyone to wait two hours in order to advance is kind of a garbage system. Not everyone has money they can just throw into the game to advance quickly. They need to make the goals more obtainable. Even the clothes for your character are outrageously expensive. I hope they fix this and don't keep up with this business model.
