That's the worst approach to it. I was expecting a good game. And until we maintain the "well it's mobile, OF COURSE it'll be a freemium" demeanor, all games will keep being like that, because "well people are okay with it so why tf not". If people actually act against it, the model would have no choice but to die out.

Also, there's a difference between a game with active microtransactions and a freemium game. There are plenty of mobile games that do have the opportunity to buy stuff and help yourself, but it's not flat out impossible to play unless you pay, as is the case in Hogwarts Mystery. Seriously, unless you shell out cash, there is liteally *nothing* you can do except either stare at the pretty picture of close the game and wait. This is combined with a model in which quests have a time limit to complete- so basically you need to wait, but if you wait too long, you lose anyway, and have to start over anyway, back in the same cicle. All designed in an extremely stupidly obvious way to eventually frustrate you into spending. It's an extremely messed up model that should be rooted out and not at all tolerated.
