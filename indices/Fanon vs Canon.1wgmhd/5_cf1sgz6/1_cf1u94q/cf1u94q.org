I think it takes a certain amount of introspection and life experience to see the value of the Weasleys, specifically Ron. If you isolate the plot, it's easy to say that Harry and Hermione could probably get from point A to point B without Ron, therefore he is a useless character. But when you look at the trio as a whole, and the kind of people that Harry and Hermione are without him, you see Ron's value. It's the same thing with Mrs. Weasley. I think fans see her as getting in the way of the plot (i.e., in DH), which is fair, but you have to understand where she's coming from as a parent and really appreciate the support that she and her family provides for Harry.

Hermione takes care of what Harry needs intellectually, but the Weasleys as a whole provide for Harry emotionally and quite literally keep him sane.

And yes, when Hermione becomes a gorgeous woman. It bugs me when any of the characters suddenly decide that they love love hair and makeup and department stores. Somehow, I don't think that Ginny has a weakness for designer shoes, considering she grew up in rural (and magically isolated) southwest England and then went to school in rural (and magically isolated) northern Scotland.
