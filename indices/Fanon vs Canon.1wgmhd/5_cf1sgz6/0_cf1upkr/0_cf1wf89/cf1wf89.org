I wholly agree. Although I do imagine Ginny as being a bit more fashion-conscious than Hermione due to her circle of friends, but it's a matter of cost for her. She seems to have been rather popular and liked, so I think she might be more aware of fashion and beauty than Hermione, who is as lost as a Malfoy in an Apple store.

I like to think that as Hermione aged, she became a little more fashion forward, although not without some help from Ginny. But during school, there is no way she would hike up her skirt, sport a Louis Vitton bag, or suddenly know exactly how to wear make-up. The only thing I think of her knowing is how to tame her hair.
