Boarding schools in general tend to be somewhat isolating in that respect. You can shop over the summer, but "going to the mall with your friends" isn't really a thing when you're in boarding school. And at most schools, there's not as much of an emphasis put on that kind of thing, though of course it still exists. Things like clothes, makeup, and hair products tend to be shared a lot as well. Hogwarts doesn't seem to be a big exception.

I think it's also fair to say that there's a difference between dressing nicely and being fashionable/caring about fashion. I definitely see Hermione's mother as the type to try to buy her daughter clothes and girly things in an attempt to bond and fill the void created by Hermione's lack of female friends. Plus she would want Hermione to present herself well. Mothers like that kind of thing. But Hermione has to want to care about things like makeup, and I don't know if she did.

I know girls who don't really give a crap, but their mothers buy them cute jackets and bottles of concealer, and they just sort of go with it.
