I agree with that and I definitely overlooked what you brought up. Silly me. I guess I was just thinking of her as someone who tends to focus more on books and character, rather than looks. I also don't think she interacted much with Parvati and Lavender, I found their relationship to be awkward and a bit strained. She also seemed to spend a lot more time in the library or with the boys than in her dormitory. But it is possible, as you said, that she might have overheard a thing or two.

I can imagine her studiously, but secretly, looking up some fashion tips in magazines and books to prepare for a date or an event. And if Ron or Harry shows up, she frantically puts it away like a boy caught with porn, especially if they are younger.

For all we know, Hermione was this secret fashionista and knew the most about fashion out of the entire school, haha.

Btw, this is a really fun discussion. :) I'm quite enjoying it. Not many of my friends are big Harry Potter fans, so I love it when I find people with the same interests who I can talk to.
