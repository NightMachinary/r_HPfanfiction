I slightly disagree with saying Hermione could not develop a sense of fashion or makeup while at school, and that ginny would be essential for her being more fashion forward later. I don't think she could live in dorm with Lavender and Parvati for 7 years and not observer/talk about fashion at all. Also i think it is kind of implied with the Yule Ball scenes that Hermione can dress up (which implies makeup i think). Furthermore you must also remember she goes home during the summers(while we don't have much insight in her home life and her mom being a dentist might not place utmost importance on fashion), you can't rule out that her mom doesn't educate/influence her in this regard.

While I don't think Hermione suddenly being fashionable and gorgeous is realistic in stories. I don't think it is farfetched to portray her as placing importance on fashion and her appearance if she has a crush/love interest or something.

(although as a guy I really have no clue about this stuff
