I hate Weasley bashing. I love all of them and I feel that people turn on them just because they can't think of a creative way to put in an antagonist. If you're going to change their personality, give a plausible reason. In a fic I wrote, I had Ron get hit by a curse that messed up his mind and personality, so he developed this strange split-personality. In the end, he got help and slowly turned back to who he was. But I didn't do it simply because I needed an antagonist; I wanted to add an emotional aspect to his relationship with Harry and Hermione.

I also despise how people always pair students with teachers or incest fics. Fred banging George? Not cool. Hermione suddenly falls in love with Snape? Unbelievably creepy. It makes me feel gross.

In fanon, I hate it when people have Draco instantly become a good guy and best friends with Hermione, Harry, and Ron. I don't ever see him behaving friendly with Ron, civil yes, but not friendly. At least give some explanation, write a prologue, or add some detail as to why he changed sides, how, and explain the struggles he went through to become who he is now.

Last one, I hate in fanon how Hermione always becomes ths gorgeous woman. I always write her as lovely but plain, I give her a softer tummy, smaller/average boobs, etc. I hate how people turn her into a beauty queen that the whole school spontaneously falls in love with. She's not supposed to be gorgeous, she's supposed to be realistic and human. She doesn't suddenly grow DD's or decide to dress like a skank. She's modest, intelligent, and simple.
