In canon i really disliked the fact that Harry ended up with Ginny for the sole reason of Ginny not being described very much. We did not know a lot about her other than she is Ron's sister and she plays Quiddich. Other than that i disliked how little Remus was in the story. He was introduced as one of Harry's fathers friends but after third year he is barely heard from. You would think that Harry would have kept up beeter contact with him.

Now for fanon i really dislike when the sole purpose of the plot and all of the conflicts are solved by super politician Harry. He grew up in the muggle world and therefore would have no idea about pureblood tradition. Also i am against slash. Nothing against those who are gay or enjoy slah i just don't think Harry would have become gay. It just isnt my thing.

Sorry if the grammar is bad i typed this all on my phone.
