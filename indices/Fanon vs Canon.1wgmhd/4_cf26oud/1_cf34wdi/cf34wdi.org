Completely agree. Ginny is never really described enough to explain why harry ends up with her and loves her. It has been a while now since i read the 6th book but i just feel their relationship is never portrayed in a way that you get an idea why they should end up together.

While I do really enjoy the super political Harry stories and when the politics are explained, it does bug me when it is too easy. Harry is always portrayed as suddenly being super politically savvy (often with the help of some key mentors) and going against the manipulative Dumbledore. I really wish fics included Harry making political mistakes or being outsmarted as well. THey always try to portray Dumbledore as the poltical genius who has been 'ruling' the wizarding world for decades, yet he is outsmarted and brought down in a couple months? No. It would so much more intriguing for me if Dumbledore also still had a couple tricks up of his sleeve and also other political actors came into play.

again agree with the not liking slash. for me it almost always causes me to stop reading the story immediately. Only slash pairing I don't completely mind is Sirius/Remus in a more paternal role.
