I've read a couple fics where Dudley ends up being gay, and I think that's a really interesting take on the character and brings a lot of depth to Dudley's treatment of Harry, his relationship with his parents, his feelings about magic, the way he processes his childhood experiences as an adult, and his perceptions on what is and isn't "normal."
