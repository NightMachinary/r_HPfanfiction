Oh no, haha. I can't remember the name at the moment, but the best Draco fic I've ever read really artfully explored the whole repressing-himself-to-please-his-family thing. As in, he was an asshole because he was unhappy, not because he was gay. I don't know maybe it's just because I'm gay and have had a similar experience (I hope I wasn't as big of a jerk as he was though, haha,) but I find the whole idea interesting.
