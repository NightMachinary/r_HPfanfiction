There is a post from a few days ago that ask what make you stop reading a fanfic, I knew that would be people complaing about the bashing of Ron, Ginny, Molly and Dumbledore. But I was surprise that there was no one trying to defend it (sorry if there is someone that defend it, but I didn't find it). If it is okay with every one I will not try to defend it, but I want to give my point of view.

I find easy to think that Dumbledore was a bad guy and manipulative for 2 reasons (I can give more but just 2 is enough) 1) He put a baby in care of a family that he doesn't know, and doesn't check the baby for 10 years. 2) Knows his parents killer is alive and doesn't prepare Harry to defend himself. (Which is something I don't like about canon Harry, someone try to kill you when you were a baby, find out that he is alive when you are 11 and start a group to pratice defense only when you are 15, why?)

When I read the books Ron wasn't my favorite character but I didn't complain, what I would do? Change the book? But when I start reading FF and see others opinion about Ron I start to really dislike him. He was/is lazy and jealous. Even if he did one or two things important, I believe that if he was a secondary character, Harry and Hermione would still defeat Voldemort.

The only thing that I don't like about Molly is that she seems like a narcissist mother "Ginny has to marry the boy-who-lived because that would make me happy!" "The twins have to stop the jokes because it gives a bad image to the family (i. e. Me)!" "All my children have to have a job in the Ministry because that would give a good image to the family (i. e. Me)!"

I am not gonna say anything about Ginny because I can see good and bad in her.

Again, this is just my opinion, and it is not the only kind of FF that I read. I read 2 or 3 FF that Ron is a good guy. If you say that you know two FFs for me to read, and in one there would have bashing and the other not. I would read both, but I would start reading the one with bashing.
