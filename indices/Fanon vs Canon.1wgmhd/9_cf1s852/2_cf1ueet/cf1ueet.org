I'm going to defend some of the things you attack Dumbledore for:

#+begin_quote
  He put a baby in care of a family that he doesn't know, and doesn't check the baby for 10 years.
#+end_quote

The Dursleys ARE Harry's real family, and the only ones he has left. Just because you have advanced knowledge about them and the way they will treat Harry doesn't mean it's weird or wrong for Dumbledore to place an orphan with his family.

And even then, to conclude that this was all a giant conspiracy on his part rather than an honest mistake is really pushing the envelope.

Also, the guy is the headmaster of a school. He doesn't work for child's services, he doesn't work for the ministry, he's not Harry's Godfather, he doesn't actually have any right nor obligation at all to take care of random orphans.

#+begin_quote
  Knows his parents killer is alive and doesn't prepare Harry to defend himself
#+end_quote

By that logic, literally everyone in the entire world is guilty of this. You can't place this one on Dumbledore's shoulders as if it was solely his responsibility to train a kid. Also, like you said, canon Harry isn't exactly asking anyone for help either. He barely gets his normal schoolwork done.
