  I think that the real issue people have when they bash Dumbledore is, very ironically, that they respect him too much! They assume the man is literally an all-powerful super-wizard and that everything that ever happens was a deliberate plot that he planned all along.

They assume that he has a lot of power? Maybe, if you are talking about magic power, but if you are talking abou politic power:

#+begin_quote
  Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, [...] Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Professor Dumbledore also served as Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards (?--1995) and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot (?--1995; 1996-1997) [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore][Source]]

He had *three* important political positions *at the same time*, he could have done something. I believe if something like this happen it would be enough:

/"What are you doing here? I don't want any of your people here at my house!" said Vernon glowering at Dumbledore./

/"I just came here to say something" said Dumbledore, looking calmly into the eyes of Vernon "Harry is an important person to me, to the wizard world, and we will keep an eye on him, to be sure that he is not in danger."/

/And Vernon, using all his brain, could understand what he is saying. There will be wizards looking for Harry, and he coulnd't know when they will be looking, because they could be using magic./

It wouldn't be necessary to have someone (e.g. an auror) there be sure Vernon wouldn't do anything, the fear of having someone watching it would be enough to make Harry life easy.

And, again IIRC because I am not sure if this happen in canon or just in FFs, he have the Order of the Phoenix keep an eye on Harry.

Now back to Arabella, IIRC (I read the books 7-10 years ago) one of the description of Harry in book one was that he was *malnourished*, for me that is one big red exclamation mark that something wrong is happening, and if she was there to keep Harry safe, not only from Death Eaters and bad wizards, she could look at window of the house to see how he is going (I can go an keep looking at my neighbor for an hour now if I wanted to).

Hope to keep this conversation, I finally have someone to talk about this and I am having so much fun :D
