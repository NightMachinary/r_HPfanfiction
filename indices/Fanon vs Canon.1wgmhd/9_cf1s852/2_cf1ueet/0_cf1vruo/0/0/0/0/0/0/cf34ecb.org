I still don't like Dumbledore, but I can't totally blame him for what happen to Harry when he was with the Dursley. If only this is the only thing I don't likeabout him :/

I am still curious with what you have to say about his trust issues.

I don't know a lot about this so I am not comfortable with saying this, but here it goes, why doesn't he make the things better to the muggleborn? He had a lot of political power but I didn't see the changes he could have made. Again not sure about this because I don't know all the history but it is what I believe that happen :~
