I don't think Dumbledore truly comprehends how horrible the Dursleys are. It's a combination of that 1800s logic and magic. Magic fixes a lot of things so wizards don't really have the same kind of concern for their children's well-being that we do.

Just look at Neville. His Uncle Algie dangled him out of a window and dropped him when he got distracted by dessert. What if he had actually been a Squib?

But no, wizards don't think about things like that because magic instinctively kicks in and keeps them from dying from accidents like this.

Look at Quidditch. Bludgers are made out of solid iron. And the whole point of a Bludger is to hurt the player. Sure, it's not sporting to swing it into someone's face, but iron balls that slam right into you aren't exactly things that a non-magical person could just shake off.

My point is, I think Dumbledore never gave the Dursleys much thought because well, how much damage could a Muggle do lol. That, and the fact that mental health is a foreign concept to him basically meant that the Dursleys' abuse was never going to be a priority when compared to Voldemort's capacity for muder.
