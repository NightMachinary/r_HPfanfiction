Humm, this is interesting (and funny, as if the wizard world weren't living in the 1800s to this day). I can't say that you a wrong because I don't know much about the custom of that time. So he kept Harry lock up in the Durleys home to keep him safe, okay, I can understand that, but the moment that he left him with the Dursley he isn't keeping him safe anymore.

I guess I am just angry that he didn't go the extra mile, if he want to keep Harry safe from the bad wizards, why not keep him safe from everyone?

Another thing that I don't like about Dumbledore is that is seems he doesn't trust anyone. He always knew, or at least guess, about the Horcrux, but didn't ask anyone help. If you can trust your back in a fight to someone else, why not ask him for help?
