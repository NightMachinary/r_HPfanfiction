Dumbledore has trust issues because he never actually has an equal. It is a fact that he's the most powerful wizard in the story and quite possibly the most intelligent. Grindelwald was the only man that could stand before him as an equal. Before meeting Grindelwald, there was no one who could interact with him at the same level, so I assume he got used to keeping things to himself. This would also have been true after the disastrous summer romance.

This means that he doesn't completely understand how normal people function, therefore he only gives them as much information as he /thinks/ they can handle. That, coupled with the fact that Voldemort is an excellent mind reader, means that Dumbledore has to be a paranoid bastard regardless of whether he wants to actually be one.

I don't know what you mean by 'making things better for the Muggleborns' but Hogwarts and Magical Britain has clearly gone through many changes since the rise of Dumbledore. Draco is the only idiot who still throws terms like 'Mudblood' around. Being a Muggleborn doesn't mean that you'll be denied a quality education, or a job at the Ministry of Magic. There's not really much of a problem, unless you want to make some headway into the Conservative end of Pureblood society.

Now Muggles on the other hand...
