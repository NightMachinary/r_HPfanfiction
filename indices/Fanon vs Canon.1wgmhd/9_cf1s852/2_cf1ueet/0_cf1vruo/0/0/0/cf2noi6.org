It's not a conspiracy and Dumbledore's not really a gigantic jerk. He just comes off as someone who was born in the 1800s (which he technically was). You know, the era when confining someone to a bed for days on end was a thing (seriously, go read The Yellow Wallpaper), mental health was a weird concept better left to Freud and his buddies, locking someone up to keep them safe was a perfectly acceptable solution and child abuse was this secret best kept in the family.

Considering how ass-backwards the Wizarding World can seem at times, it's entirely plausible that Dumbledore was a victim of a social mores of his time. One only has to look at Ariana Dumbledore's treatment and Sirius Black's confinement to see the parallels. Just because a man is /better/ than his society and culture does not mean that he is a better /person/ than everyone else.
