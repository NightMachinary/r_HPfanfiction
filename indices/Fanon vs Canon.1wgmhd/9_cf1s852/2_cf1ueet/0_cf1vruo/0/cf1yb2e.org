  And if you asked "How can Dumbledore know what happen in the Dursley home?" Well, one person, Arabella Figg. She is their neighbor and a squib, IIRC she was put there by Dumbledore to keep check on Harry. Either she is crappy informant or Dumbledore see nothing wrong with her report.

Remember that Petunia is obsessed with appearances. It's not like she advertises for the entire neighborhood that Harry is mistreated and sleeps in a cupboard. Arabella saw Harry several times in the neighborhood and he looked healthy enough to not raise immediate alarms. There's only so much she can do as a squib without being too obvious. I believe she genuinely didn't know.

She was most likely there to keep an eye out for other wizards and to alert Dumbledore if someone like Malfoy was snooping around Privet Drive.

  And after Harry goes to Hogwarts? Why did Dumbledore keep sending Harry to the Dursley? I am not sure if he have to be the because of a ward or this is just something that I read on FFs, let say that it is true, Harry have to be with the Dursley, okay, but have to be there and have protection from the family it is two different thing. He could have done something to protect Harry from his family.

There is indeed a very powerful bloodward around Privet Drive, that is canon.

And like I said before: Dumbledore does not actually have any official authority over the placement of orphans. If he placed Harry with another wizarding family, then someone like Lucius Malfoy could and would very easily snoop in and have Fudge give him custody over Harry. And we all know the ministry is corrupt enough to do just that. Placing him with his family is the only thing that no one can object to.

It's not like Dumbledore likes that Petunia is such a bitch, but what choice does he really have? He can't exactly Imperious them to be nicer to Harry.

I think that the real issue people have when they bash Dumbledore is, very ironically, that they respect him too much! They assume the man is literally an all-powerful super-wizard and that everything that ever happens was a deliberate plot that he planned all along. They think that Dumbledore engineered all the bad things to happen like a great chess-player who knows the entire board. Whereas in actuality, he is just a tired old man trying his best but making mistakes, just like any one of us. I believe that Dumbledore doesn't know about even half the things people blame him for.
