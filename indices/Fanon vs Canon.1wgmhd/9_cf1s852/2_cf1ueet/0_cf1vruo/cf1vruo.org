Good now we are talking, usually when I try to talk about this, people just say that I am wrong.

I get what you are saying about focusing all the blame on Dumbledore, and I probably am. But he is the one with more power and knowledge about the situation to do something. Remus didn't do anything about either, and even if he tried what could he do? He was a werewolf, no power there :/ and anyone else (can't think of anyone now) that have the power to do something, probably didn't where Harry lived, even less what was his situation.

And if you asked "How can Dumbledore know what happen in the Dursley home?" Well, one person, Arabella Figg. She is their neighbor and a squib, IIRC she was put there by Dumbledore to keep check on Harry. Either she is crappy informant or Dumbledore see nothing wrong with her report.

And after Harry goes to Hogwarts? Why did Dumbledore keep sending Harry to the Dursley? I am not sure if he have to be the because of a ward or this is just something that I read on FFs, let say that it is true, Harry have to be with the Dursley, okay, but have to be there and have protection from the family it is two different thing. He could have done something to protec Harry from his family.

I really can't blame Dumbledore that he doesn't did anything to prepared Harry if Harry himself doesn't want to anything. I guess I will just be disappointed with both of them.
