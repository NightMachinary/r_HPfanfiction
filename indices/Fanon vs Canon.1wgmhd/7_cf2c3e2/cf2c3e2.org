What I hate most about fanon is when authors justify house elf slavery by declaring that the elf's will die without a master. Hermione was right; just because the house elves seem to like being slaves, does not mean that it is ok. Compare it to a child that is brought up believing he is superior just because of his pedigree (Draco); belief that something is right does not make it so. I am fine with Harry hiring Dobby, but making Dobby once more a slave is wrong.
