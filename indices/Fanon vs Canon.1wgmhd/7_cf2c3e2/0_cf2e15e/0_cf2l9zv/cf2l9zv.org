I think it's likely that it's partly spell-coercion (they must punish themselves when they disobey, as per the spell put on their ancestors), and partly psychological necessity. I doubt there were many atheists in Dark Ages Britain, even though there was the technical possibility of it. There's no genetic compulsion to serve God, but social pressure and very strict laws, combined with very poor living conditions and education, will ensure that faith is practically universal.
