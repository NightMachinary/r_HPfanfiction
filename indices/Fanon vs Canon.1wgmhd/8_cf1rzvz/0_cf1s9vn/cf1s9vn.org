I love writing Blaise. I always think of him as a neutral Slytherin, one who just wants to go to school, have a bit of fun, and avoid unnecessary complications. I always write him as this conscience for Draco, someone to give him advice and try to steer him on the right path.

In one of my fics, I paired him with Luna and people loved it, which surprised me because it just randomly came to me.

All in all, I love him in fics because he's intelligent but not overly so, balanced, and, if well-written, be seen as a good companion for Draco if one seeks to make Draco a non-douchebaggy-baddie character.
