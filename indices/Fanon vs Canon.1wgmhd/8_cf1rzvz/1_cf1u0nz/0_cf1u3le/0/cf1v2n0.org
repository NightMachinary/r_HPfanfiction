  I think it's pretty well agreed that the idea that 25% of the entire student body is flat-out EVIL. I don't really understand what you mean by this? Are you saying that 25% of the student body population is evil according to fanon ideas, or you think that's something that was firmly established in the books themselves?

Because I'm definitely not willing to write off 25% of the Hogwarts population, and I don't think it's fair to say that Slytherin character=aspiring Death Eater and anything less is unrealistic.
