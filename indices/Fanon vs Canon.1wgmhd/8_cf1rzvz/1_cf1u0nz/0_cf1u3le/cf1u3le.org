I think it also comes from a desire to have some kind of development, any kind, really, for the Slytherins. I think it's pretty well agreed that the idea that the idea that 25% of the entire student body is flat-out EVIL is kind of silly.

Blaise was/is an opportunity to show what else a Slytherin can be, without having to radically change a pre-existing character (i.e. making Harry a Slytherin, making Draco or Pansy "good," etc.)

Edit- Added "is kind of silly," totally reversing the meaning of the post...
