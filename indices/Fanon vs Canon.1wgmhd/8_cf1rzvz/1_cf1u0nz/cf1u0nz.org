I kind of get this. First of all, the fact that we don't know much about him probably means that he's not on the same level as Malfoy or Nott. Even if he wasn't described until book six, you would think Harry would have described him as "one of Malfoy's cronies" rather than just as a Slytherin boy that Harry disliked on principle. I got the impression that from his mannerisms that he was a bit snobbish, so I think that's why people characterize him as neutral and wanting to stay out of the fray.
