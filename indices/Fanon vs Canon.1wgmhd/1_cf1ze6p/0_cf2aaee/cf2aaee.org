The most common complaint among fanfic authors is "Luna is fucking impossible to write". She is the second most complex character in canon (after Snape), but the one with the most foreign mindset to... uhh... anyone? She doesn't think with hate, conformism, ego, anger and pessimism /at all/ - how is someone supposed to channel that personality into writing?
