I'm going to go look for that story now. In school, people would make jokes about me saying because I was quiet, I must be a ticking time bomb or something, and the bad depictions of Luna strike me as a similar sort of misjudgement. Her experience with loss makes me think she would be a good match for Harry, though. Whenever they talk, they always understand each other.
