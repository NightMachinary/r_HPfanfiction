I've have trouble writing Luna too, but I keep coming back to her portrayal in Stages of Hope. I think Silverstorm nailed it because she was digging for the underlying damage in Luna's character.

She's not that kid in school who's weeaboo kooky, and I hate when she's portrayed that way. She's the kooky kid who's had a rough life growing up, and so that's how she's adapted, like shutting out the real world (which she's done). But her kooky mask only drives people away, so she retreats further into her shell. It becomes a cycle.

She's been projected upon by readers as being completely insightful, to the point of being cast as a seer, but when you read the stories, the subject she mostly comprehends relate to loss and loneliness, which she is most familiar with. I don't think she really opens up until the Weasley wedding (wearing yellow and dancing with friends and family) which ends in further tragedy and loss. Then she gets kidnapped and, probably, tortured.

She doesn't break then, but I don't think it's because she's wise, but because she's hard.

*TLDR: I think Luna is hard as fuck.*
