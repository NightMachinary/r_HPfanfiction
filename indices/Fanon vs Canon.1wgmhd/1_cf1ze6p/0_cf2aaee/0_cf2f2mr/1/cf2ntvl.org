It's like she takes in the world around her and is very much emotionally present, but she filters it in such a unique way that people think she's living in a different world. She's not the least bit naive, and she feels loss and pain just as deeply as anyone else.

Stages of Hope is the best portrayal of the character of Luna that I think I've ever seen in a fanfic. It's an amazing portrayal of an amazingly complex character that's extremely difficult to write. The moment where she gets halfway through one of her stories and then breaks is absolutely heartwrenching. As a reader, I think that's the moment where I stopped feeling sorry for all of them and started mourning them.
