I think Luna must be hard to write, because I haven't seen many fics where she's actually the right kind of kooky. She isn't all-knowing, she can't see the future, and she isn't really insane. She's just ruthlessly optimistic, doesn't bother with social norms, and is into conspiracy theories. It's annoying when the plot depends on her knowing things she could never possibly know with no explanation.

Someone also mentioned magical cores... In some stories, if you do too much magic at once, you can die. If that were really an issue, don't you think that would have been brought up? I like when authors try to add depth to the canon, but it has to be plausible.
