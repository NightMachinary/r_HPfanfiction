Men tend to read (and get off on) femslash, I have had enough male friends and boyfriends to know this.

Women tend to read (and get off on) slash. I'm not sure why this is, but it happens. I'd recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][this]] for Harry/Multi, and [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/main.php?list=822][here]] for tons of femslash. Mind you, most of it is smut, but oh well. I primarily read slash, but I have a few Harry/harem fics if you want. I used to be obsessed with Harry/multi, and I'm slowly getting back into it.
