It's when authors take canon Hermione and make every attribute ultra-mega, often to the point of ridiculousness:

- She doesn't just have a good memory, she has an eidetic one.

- She's not just pretty, she's exceptionally gorgeous, one of the most beautiful women attending Hogwarts.

- She's not just very smart, she's the most brilliant magical mind of all time.

- She's not just good at magic, she's the most powerful and accomplished witch in history and her magical feats are legendary.

- She's not just a very good student, she's the best that Hogwarts has ever produced.

- She doesn't just know how to play piano, she's a conservatorie musician able to master the most difficult classical pieces with verve and polish.

Any one or two of these might be fine, a bit of authorial license and not too great an extrapolation of canon. It's when an author employs most or all that it turns from being a story to a celebration of the Platonic ideal of Hermioneness.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/12/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen][This story]] by [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] is an example of what I'd classify as Hermione-wank, though it's arguably the most readable story of this type. Most of it is /far/ worse.
