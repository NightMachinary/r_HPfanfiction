- Wandless magic can do everything a wand can
- Friendly goblins
- Goblins that act like short Klingons (better than friendly, but please... they're Ferengi without the comedic ineptitude)
- Luna as a seer, particularly in 'Fate is her bitch' mode
- Potters are a noble and most ancient house as well, not to mention wealthier than... well, the author at this point. I mean sure, they're related to the Peverells. So were the Gaunts, and their family manor was basically a hunting shack
