- any glorification of Severus Snape; he was a mean, spiteful man who tried to game the system and lost. What was, essentially, a death bed confession should not have turned this sinner into the saint most make him out to be

- overly evil Dumbledore; too many fanfics turn him into a lex luthor style cartoon villain. He was an old war hero who may have bought into his own hype, maybe.

- Weasley bashing in general; most have already said it, but i'll add this: if you don't like them, don't put them in your story. If you want an EWE story where harry divorces ginny? fine but don't rake the entire family over the coals.
