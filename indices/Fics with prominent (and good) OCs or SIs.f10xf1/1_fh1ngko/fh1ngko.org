The Alexandra Quick series by Inverarity is excellent. It's set in the wizarding world we know, but with in the US and in the early 2000 IIRC, so pretty much all characters are OCs. There are four completely posted books, and the author is currently posting the fifth. You can find it on FFnet: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity]]

The same author also has a really fun story called Hogwarts Houses Divided, featuring Teddy Lupin and his school friends (obviously all OCs too).
