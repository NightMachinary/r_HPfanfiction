Have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), yet? He never went to Hogwarts in that fic.

--------------

Brennus likes Harry going to Hogwarts late or never. He is a dedicated H/G shipper, but Ginny in his fics are SIGNIFICANTLY different than in canon. She either did not have crush on him, did not know him, or was downright hostile to him:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9065880/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Butterfly-Effect][Harry Potter and the Butterfly Effect]], linkffn(9065880): Flamels took him in. Harry only went to Hogwarts for the final year. Extreme Dumbledore and strong Weasley bashing, although Weasleys redeemed themselves in the end.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9537818/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nameless-Man][Harry Potter and the Nameless Man]], linkffn(9537818): Harry never went to Hogwarts. He and Ginny met well after the War, and went to hunt a serial killer.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463): Grindelwald trained Harry, and he returned in Year 6. Nobody trusted him, and Ginevra was in Slytherin and hostile to him at first. This is the ultimate bash fic with over-the-top sex and violence.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11054843/1/Homecoming][Homecoming]], linkffn(11054843): Harry never went to Hogwarts and returned to Britain several years after the War. He and Tonks were working on a case, and met Ginny accidentally. [[/spoiler][Daphne Greengrass and her father were the big bad]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic][Gothic]], linkffn(11922116): Harry never went to Hogwarts and was not trusted by the Weasleys. He however hired Ginny to accompany him on some adventures, but the ending threw a twist.
