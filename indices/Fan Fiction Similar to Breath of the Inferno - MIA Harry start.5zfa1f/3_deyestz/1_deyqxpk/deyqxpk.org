Ive read The Return of the Marauders, but did not really like it, although my opinion may of been colored by it being a Harry/Ginny fic.. and again.. not really a an of that pairing. It was a source of major disappointment in the original books. So unfortunately every time i read a fan fiction with it, my thoughts are already colored by that opinion.

However the other 2 are on my kindle right now and waiting to be read. I had just held off for a variety of reasons. Sounds like i need to give them another look. Thanks for the recs!
