Sounds like we have really similar taste, one user already mentioned the author Brennus, many of his fics will fit your requirements. Two more I think you'll like are linkffn(11868509; 5856625) . You'd also probably like linkffn(2567419) , it's a bit of what you're looking for but starting after Sirius' death. It starts during the summer that follows 5th year and has Harry breaking away from Dumbledore as he becomes more independent/powerful.
