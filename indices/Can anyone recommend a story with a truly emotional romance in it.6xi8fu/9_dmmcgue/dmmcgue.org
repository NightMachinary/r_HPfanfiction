linkffn(the yellow submarine by deadwoodpecker) has slowwww burn Harry and Ginny, who are both recovering from extreme trauma. It covers some serious topics though so a trigger warning may be necessary. The romance is emotional and wonderful. The story isn't technically completed but the major plot points are tied up where it leaves off.
