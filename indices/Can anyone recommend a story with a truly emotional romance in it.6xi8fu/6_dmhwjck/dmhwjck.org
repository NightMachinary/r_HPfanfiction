Since you liked A Cadmean Victory youll almost definitely like linkffn(letters by theendless7)

and maybe linkffn(The Pureblood Princess) might be up your alley if you can stomach the Daphne. Her portrayal seems to polarize people, if you dont warm up to her within the first few chapters its probably not worth continuing but i dug it.
