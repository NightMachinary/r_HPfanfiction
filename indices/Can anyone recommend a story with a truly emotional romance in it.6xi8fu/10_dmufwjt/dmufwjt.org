My Deliverance by Twin Suns

Marauder Era, canon & James/Lily - slow paced and mature. A more grave, solemn James. Takes place 7th year. Characters are heavily affected by the war. I'm a huge marauder fan and I'd say it's the most realistic, well developed marauder fic I've read. James and Lily grow into each other through a deepened maturity.

Incomplete , but worth the read.
