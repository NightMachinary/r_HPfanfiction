It's a work in progress, but it's been updated recently. I think it is something you'd like.

Harry has red hair and that prompts him to think of his mother as his role model, and not his father. This might be the most Slytherin-like Gryffindor Harry I've ever read, and it's all for the sake of his friendship with Draco.

It's marked as slash too, but it's not going to happen very soon from the looks of things.

Still, a very entertaining read for the way Harry tries to better himself without deviating too much from the capabilities of young child.
