I honestly can't remember. I'm pretty sure he was in Slytherin and hated Lockhart so he started skipping and studying on his own. I'm thinking tag wise its probably Slytherin harry. Manipulative Dumbledore. Abuse (Dursleys) Maybe Mentor Snape? and good Slytherins ( I think he was friends with Theo). I think it was an independent or smart harry. I know he was abused and that's why he was quieter and not mean but colder? but i don't know if any of that was tagged. Sorry.

While this isn't the one I'm think of (that one had no time travel.)\\
Let's Try Again by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/DayDreamer315/pseuds/DayDreamer315][DayDreamer315]], has a lot of the stuff I mention in my post. Including self studying. Though its a Harry/Fred/George and super fucking long like 600k words. It's one of my favs.
