I don't want to be a bother, but do you remember the other fic where Harry did self-study for Defence and Dumbledore kept trying to get him into class? If you don't know, you mentioned that it was most likely on Ao3, and I'm wondering if you know what tags the fic had and what relationship it was.

Thanks!
