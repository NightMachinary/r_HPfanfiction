[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][What you leave behind]] is an AU where Harry is a year older than canon. A fresh twist on the trio rehash, with the focus now on Cedric, Cho and Harry. The author writes each character very well and it feels like canon even though it isn't. Plot isn't moving too fast atm (only 3 chapters in so we can cut him some slack), but its an interesting read.
