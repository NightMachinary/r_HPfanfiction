[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10724650/1/Death-Before-Dishonour][Death Before Dishonour]] is a Slytherin Harry AU picking up in sixth year. The plot idea and characterisations are unique, though the there are some typos and a fair number of technical errors. It's essentially about Harry and his Slytherin friends running minor criminal enterprises out of Hogwarts, and looks like it will develop into a kind of organised crime origins story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10557311/1/The-Magnate][The Magnate]] is a "Voldemort won" AU where James didn't marry Lily but a pure-blood woman. Harry is unaware that Lily is his mother and that he's not a pure-blood like his brother. The fic starts with James arranging for Lily to tutor Harry and then moves on to Durmstrang, where Harry is sent because Snape is Hogwarts headmaster.
