Rather than repeat a bunch of links, I'll point you to the most recent stories in my C2, ordered by publish date in the link (which includes the two that Taure proffered, recommendations that I second): [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Good-Stuff-Edited-by-Perspicacity/93584/99/2/1/0/0/0/0/][link]]. The C2 has stories from a variety of fandoms.

Over on fanficauthors.net, a few new stories by authors of note have been posted: Jeconais's [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Blue_Steel/Chapter_1/][Blue Steel]], Kokopelli's [[http://kokopelli.nsns.fanficauthors.net/By_right_of_conquest/index/][By Right of Conquest]], and Deluded Musing's (aka Clell's) [[http://deluded-musings.fanficauthors.net/Peril/Hufflepuffs/][Peril]] and [[http://deluded-musings.fanficauthors.net/Inspected_by_No_13/A_Bureaucrat_is_Born/][Inspected by Number 13]]. None are particularly remarkable, but they're at least serviceable stories by writers who have done decent writing in the past.
