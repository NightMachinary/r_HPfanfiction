Look up "A Boy and his Cloak" on FFN (no link due to underage). By far the best character depiction in a smutfic.

If you are into Harem's with an actual emotional investment (so not just random sex), there are "The Power of Seven" (Ao3), Fugue (Ao3) and "It could only happen to Harry". Power of Seven and It could only... have ritualistic coverns, Power has Ginny as primary partner, It could has Hermione. Both are decent when it comes to characterisation and it does not feel like just a cheap porn plot. Fugue has some perverted entity possessing Harry and Hermione helps him to "investigate".
