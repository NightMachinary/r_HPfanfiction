Candy and books. Do not feel the need to spend ages crafting individual gifts and each person's reaction. Remember that Christmas and birthdays are pretty regular things, and unless something is super special and/or plot relevant, you don't need to lavish detail on it.

You don't even have to think of gifts at all. You can literally just say "they exchanged gifts" and be done with it.
