In order books,cannons merch/quidditch stuff,quill?,dragonhide boots(what I think Draco's a little flamboyant), wand holster, a certificate to ollivander's so he can get a new wand.

Only one that's probs weird is the wand holster for Dean. I literally don't know what to give him because he really wasn't that important canon.
