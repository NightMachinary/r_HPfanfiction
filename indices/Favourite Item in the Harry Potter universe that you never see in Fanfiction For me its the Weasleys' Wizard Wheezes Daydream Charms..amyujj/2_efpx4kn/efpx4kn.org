I've always been fascinated by Slughorn's ability to turn into a chair in the beginning of HBP. Is it like the animagus transformation, so you turn into your spiritual piece of furniture? But I've only ever seen one fic that used this ability.

Also WWW products in general. Other than Daydream Charms, there is Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder, Extendable Ears... A lot of cool and useful stuff.
