  it's just the characters ignore them.

That's the part of the books that bothers me the most, how arbitrary it is for characters to forget or remember their skills based on what the plot demands. Ron's chess skills (or possible strategic mind? Debatable whether he has one or not) isn't something that comes up in the later books. While the D.A. use the Felix Felicis in the right moment, and Draco buys Peruvian Darkness Powder for the Death Eater attack at the end of HBP.

(I also really wanted to see the W&W Portable Swamps on the battlefield.)
