Gamp's Laws are actually a canon thing, but it's canon that you can loophole it by duplicating/enlarging food you already have, because it's impossible to create it from nothing.

*Chapter 15, "The Goblin's Revenge", Deathly Hallows.*

  ‘Your mother can't produce food out of thin air,' said Hermione. ‘No one can. Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfigur---'

  ‘Oh, speak English, can't you?' Ron said, prising a fishbone out from between his teeth.

  ‘It's impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, *you can increase the quantity* if you've already got some---'

  ‘- Well, don't bother increasing this, it's disgusting,' said Ron.

It bothers me less if a fanfic tries to find a way to invalidate or re-interpret the Laws so Hermione can't duplicate the food, than it does that Hermione of canon doesn't do it when they're obviously starving. She prides herself on finding logical solutions to problems, but the plot handed her (and everyone else) an Idiot Ball there.
