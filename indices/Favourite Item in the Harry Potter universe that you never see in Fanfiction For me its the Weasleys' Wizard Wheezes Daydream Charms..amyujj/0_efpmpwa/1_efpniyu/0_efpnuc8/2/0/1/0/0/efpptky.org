The Harry Potter books were some of my favorites when I was growing up, and I remember the whimsical feeling of the magic was really inspiring. These days I've seen lots of different magic systems in books, and I think any of them can make for a great fanfiction story if written well.

The only magical "hard limit" I would absolutely despise is the DnD 'limited number of spells per awake period' system.
