I've seen lots of fanon explanations for why spells aren't used like that.

For example, in fanfiction "Gamp's Laws" are often expanded to explain why magic can't be used to make food in any way, not even by duplication.

Some fics explain that transfiguration, summoning and vanishing etc. can't be used directly on an opponent because the opponent's magic within their body resists the foreign influence.

Basically, these are all attempts to put natural laws around magic so spells are less OP and make more sense with what we observe of the canon world. (If people could duplicate food at will and make high quality clothing and shelter from nothing, why are there any poor wizards? etc.)
