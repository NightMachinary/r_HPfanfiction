Flavour, I guess.

JKR does it all the time, with how new magic introduced in one book hardly gets used in the next, because THE PLOT WILLS IT.

I still have my grumbles about the power of the Fidelius, or the Duplication Charm, which could have made Harry and Hermione's camping trip so much better if they'd bought a few cans of soup, fruits, and vegetables from a Muggle grocery store, then duplicated them whenever they were hungry. Heck, instead of using Stupefy or Expelliarmus on Death Eaters (because killing is bad), they could have used Lockhart's bone removal spell to keep their enemies down.
