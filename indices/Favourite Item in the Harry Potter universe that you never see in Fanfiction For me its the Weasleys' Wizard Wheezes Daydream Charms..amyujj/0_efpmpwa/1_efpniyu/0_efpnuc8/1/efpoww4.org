  the Duplication Charm, which could have made Harry and Hermione's camping trip so much better if they'd bought a few cans of soup, fruits, and vegetables from a Muggle grocery store, then duplicated them whenever they were hungry.

Their problem was not a lack of food in the absolute sense. The context of the discussion about Gamp's law is that Harry has caught some fish and Hermione has collected some mushrooms.

Their problem is a lack of /good/ food i.e. their inability to transform the ingredients into something that is nice to eat. Gamp's law is quoted to explain why they also can't just conjure up a plate of ready-to-eat food.
