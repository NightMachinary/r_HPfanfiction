That's why I mentioned buying canned food and duplicating it, which has a shelf life of ~1-2 years.

In canon, they actually bought canned food, but didn't think of duplicating it so that they'd have a supply around for the bad days when they couldn't find anything through scavenging. That's the bit that frustrates me about the books.

*Chapter 16, "Godric's Hollow", Deathly Hallows.*
