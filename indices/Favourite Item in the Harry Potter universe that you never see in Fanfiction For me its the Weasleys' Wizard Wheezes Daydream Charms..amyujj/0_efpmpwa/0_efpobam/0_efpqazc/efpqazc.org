In other words, the Remembrall effect.

This thread basically boils down to a list of all the items and spells that were introduced in the series, either forgotten, ignored, ineffectual, or irrelevant to the canon plot... that we wished were used /effectively/ in fanfiction.

God damn, I would totally enjoy Neville's Remembrall being used for more than a way to get Harry onto the Quidditch team.
