The Remembrall was so unbelievably useless. It made you realize that you had forgotten something, but not what it was. So then you'd drive yourself crazy for hours and not remember. (And if you were someone like me, you'd finally realize what it was you had forgotten at the most random of moments/when it no longer mattered).
