I've seen some fics where a Remembrall actualy serves a useful purpose. For example, in "Blood Crest" holding a Remembrall while learning something new makes it easier for the holder's mind to recall the information later. In "Prince of Slytherin" a Remembrall lets someone know when they have been Obliviated, and smashing the ball when it turns fully red restores the reconstructed memory.
