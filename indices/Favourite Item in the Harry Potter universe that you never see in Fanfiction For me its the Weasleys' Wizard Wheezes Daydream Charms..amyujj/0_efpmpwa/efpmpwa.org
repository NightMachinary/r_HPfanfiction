Dark Detectors for me. Foe Glasses, Secrecy Sensors, and Sneakoscopes. They seem like a clean and sensible way to derail canon plot points like Scabbers, Fake Moody, or the cursed opal necklace, without the benefit of a Peggy-Sue protagonist who knows everything... So I guess that's why they're hardly ever used.

Same reason why nobody tells the teachers anything, or why the teachers---if told---never listen.
