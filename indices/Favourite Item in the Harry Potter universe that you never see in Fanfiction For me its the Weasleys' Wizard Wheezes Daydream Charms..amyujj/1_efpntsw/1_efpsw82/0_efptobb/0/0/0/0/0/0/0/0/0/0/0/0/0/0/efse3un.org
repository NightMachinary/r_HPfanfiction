Have you somehow missed how it keeps detecting general dishonesty from third-party sources? Have you also missed that sneakiness and dishonesty is something of a permanent trait amongst Voldemort's followers? Have you thirdly missed that neither Dumbledore nor Voldemort actually use sneakoscopes in canon? Almost as if they don't consider them appropriate tools for their purposes.
