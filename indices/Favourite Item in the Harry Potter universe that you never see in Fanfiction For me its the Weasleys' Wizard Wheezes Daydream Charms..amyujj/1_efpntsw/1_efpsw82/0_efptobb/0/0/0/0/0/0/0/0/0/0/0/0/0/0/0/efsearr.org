There's such a thing as "range". Anyone with half a brain can limit third-party influence easily - even if the range is rather large, you can just meet with your suspects in a deserted area, for example.

Also, neither Dumbledore nor Voldemort use Time-Turners in canon, despite the advantage they provide. Neither of them use unbreakable Vows either - and those would most certainly break the plot.

That characters don't use the devices mentioned in the books is a flaw, not an argument.

You sprout arrogant drivel about fanfiction authors being too stupid to handle Sneakoscopes, yet your entire argument boils down to "they don't work anyway".
