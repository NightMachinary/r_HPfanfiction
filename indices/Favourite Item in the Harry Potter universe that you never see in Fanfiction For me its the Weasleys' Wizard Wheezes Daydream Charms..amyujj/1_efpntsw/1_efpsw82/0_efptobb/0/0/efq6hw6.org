  Harry --- this is a Pocket Sneakoscope. If there's someone untrustworthy around, it's supposed to light up and spin. Bill says it's rubbish sold for wizard tourists and isn't reliable, because it kept lighting up at dinner last night. But he didn't realize Fred and George had put beetles in his soup.\\
  Bye ---

PoA chapter one.

  “It's coming from your trunk, Harry,” said Ron, standing up and reaching into the luggage rack. A moment later he had pulled the Pocket Sneakoscope out from between Harry's robes. It was spin- ning very fast in the palm of Ron's hand and glowing brilliantly.\\
  “Is that a Sneakoscope?” said Hermione interestedly, standing up for a better look.\\
  “Yeah . . . mind you, it's a very cheap one,” Ron said. “It went haywire just as I was tying it to Errol's leg to send it to Harry.”\\
  “Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time?” said Hermione shrewdly.\\
  “No! Well . . . I wasn't supposed to be using Errol. You know he's not really up to long journeys . . . but how else was I supposed to get Harry's present to him?”

PoA chapter five

Only even greater idiots would rely on an item that goes off at any and all sneakiness and untrustworthiness, regardless of the type, scope or reason.
