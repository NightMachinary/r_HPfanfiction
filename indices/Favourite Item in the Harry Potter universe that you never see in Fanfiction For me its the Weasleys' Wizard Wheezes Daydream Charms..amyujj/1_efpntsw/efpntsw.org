Sneakoscope is one, I feel was wasted. Could have helped them figure something was up with Pettigrew or fake Moody.

Fred and George were brilliant, in my opinion. I thought that they could go far, not just with joke stuff, but for the Order or even the Ministry. (If they wanted to sell their stuff). I also believe that they did work with the ministry there? (Not work there, but more like sell stuff).

I liked this one: Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder it creates darkness and allows the person who spread it to escape, thinking back on Harry and co's many adventures, I thought this would be perfect for them to use.

Shield Hats would have also been a good thing for Harry and co to use. (Fred and George made them). Protecting them from charms and stuff.
