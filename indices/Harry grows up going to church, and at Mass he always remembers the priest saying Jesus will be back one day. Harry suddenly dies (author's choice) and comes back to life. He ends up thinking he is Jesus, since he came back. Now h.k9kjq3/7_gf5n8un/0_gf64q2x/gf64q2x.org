Eh, if his death and resurrection were public enough and later he went around doing miracles (wandless magic) I think he could actually pull it off. Remember that when people get really convinced of something they will generally develop progressively better mind-gymnastics skills to justify their belief -Harry being unable to resurrect people left, right and center? Well obviously it is because God didn't want them to abuse his powers; instead of walking on water he starts flying? Great! An update!

Personally I am more interested in what would be his reaction to discovering he can speak with snakes and how the religious would react to this.
