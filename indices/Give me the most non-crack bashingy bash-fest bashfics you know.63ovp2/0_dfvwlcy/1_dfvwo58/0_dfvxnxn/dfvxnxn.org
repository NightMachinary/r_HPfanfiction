Yes. Most of the villains (and I think all gay characters) are child rapists. Dumbledore and Snape have made horcruxes to be immortal and use loyalty potions on students. This is of course shown as a bad thing. Funnily enough, Hermione and Luna also use loyalty potions later on to get Harry a bunch of sex slaves, but that is portrayed as a good thing.
