Found the link to the appropriate chapter on TVTropes:

  "Perhaps I could put it this way: Barring birth control or accident, husbands who are interested in their wives do more than have an heir and stop there. Even the muggle aristocracy have an heir and a spare, and that is using those contraceptives that are terribly illegal among us. No? Well then allow me to spell it out in gory detail: Lucius had an unhealthy interest in little boys, and *belonged to a social club whose motto is: 'Sex by eight, it's too late'.* Rabastan and Rodolphus are senior members."

  Narcissa gave them all a very direct look. "All three of them were far more interested in Draco than they ever were in me or Bellatrix."

  ...

  Luna snorted mirthfully. "Dumbledore may have founded the local chapter."

  Narcissa shrugged, feeling progress by what she'd judged of his expressions. "It's possible. *I know they socialized with him at those events.*"

It's not outright said but if he's hanging out at a "social club" of this kind, there is at least the implication.

  I thought Snape just sold polyjuice bits?

I don't remember that part well I'm afraid. I've probably suppressed those memories lol.
