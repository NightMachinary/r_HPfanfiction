It's a time-travel fix-it. If by "fixing it" you mean killing /everyone/ who was ever a problem (she has a running body count. I think it's at 35 at the moment). Lots of bashing, of almost everyone, but in a highly entertaining way. And a fairly realistic portrayal of a poly relationship (Harry/Hermione/Draco), references to previous problems and everything. While there are some great sex scenes, it's definitely more than porn-with-plot.

This is a challenge site, so hopefully it'll be finished by the end of April. Looks like you can read without joining, but not comment. It's a writers' community, positive reinforcement only. And I'm pretty sure it's zero-tolerance on that point.
