It's called Rough Trade because everything is considered a rough draft, unbetaed. It's a challenge site with a deadline, so the writers don't want to be distracted with stuff they will probably catch during an editing run, /after/ the challenge is over. So positive comments are welcome, critique is not. Nothing to distract from getting the story transferred from brain to screen.

So like your mama probably said, if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all. They, at least, are not begging for reviews.
