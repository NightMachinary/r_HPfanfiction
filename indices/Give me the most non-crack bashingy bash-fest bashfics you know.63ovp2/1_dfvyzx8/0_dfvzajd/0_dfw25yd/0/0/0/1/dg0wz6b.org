There's a link for Past Projects in the menu, when people post them elsewhere (usually Ao3, or personal blogs) they can provide a link. But no, they aren't archived permanently on that site.

I've saved a few myself using Grabmybooks, just in case they never got reposted anywhere. Though most were.
