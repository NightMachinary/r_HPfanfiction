Well it's not an archive, and never has more than a few dozen stories on it, so you're not going to see links often. The stories from this round will be there until June, then they'll be removed.

And do try Darkly Loyal. I think it's hysterical, running body count and all. It's actually from a previous round - this month's challenge is to finish one you weren't able to finish in a previous challenge. The part from before is already over 100K.
