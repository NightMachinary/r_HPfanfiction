I don't find either of the things I pointed out to be turn offs, just some people seem to not like those types of changes, so just wanted to point it out incase OP was one of them.

I also don't mind overpowered protagonists so her being so strong doesn't really bother me either. The actual confrontations all still seem to have enough danger and difficulty. But I can see where you are coming from. [[/spoiler][Presumably both riddle and diarymort are at a similar power level though and her achievements make sense with her being lord level power wise combined with how hard she studies imo. I can see that the decision to make her that powerful could be a turn off. I'm more annoyed by her not embracing it and figuring out how to handle the power.]]
