Don't think the harriet part is that big of a turn off, the worst part is that she is way too strong. She has already founded 2 new schools of magic and is only in her third year. If her writer made her a bit weaker and made her rely on her potion skills to even be able to compete in school I think you would've gotten a more intresting take on this story.
