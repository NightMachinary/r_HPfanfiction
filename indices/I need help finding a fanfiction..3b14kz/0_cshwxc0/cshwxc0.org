  I remember reading this once, but I can't find it for the life of me. It's a Weasley/Dumbledore bashing fanfiction in which Harry and Hermione are fed love potions for Ginny and Ron respectively. I know that it involves them running away, and that somewhere in the first few chapters Molly having access to Harry's vault is mentioned. Any help is appreciated.

There are literally thousands of fics that fit that description. Some specific details might help.
