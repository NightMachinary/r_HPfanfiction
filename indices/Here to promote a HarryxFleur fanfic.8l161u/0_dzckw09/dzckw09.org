There are a lot of mistakes in your writing, while I see you're looking for a beta, a beta can't do everything for you. You need to understand basic formatting and spelling, writing isn't as simple as “oh, I have a good idea for a fic, let me just write out a couple of chapters and see how it goes from there!” Spelling and grammar are just as important as the premise of the fic, and even if you get a beta, it won't solve everything. You need to be able to do some of these basic things without the help of a beta.
