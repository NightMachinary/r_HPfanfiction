Maybe it's the website? Idk cause I always do quotes and italics for my dialogue. I've never done it any other way. Unless you confuse the italics with when they speak French which is also italics. Let me know, cause I'm trying to fix it. Any interest in being a Beta? Haha I need someone that can help me avoid these mistakes/mentor me on those stupid errors. Thanks!
