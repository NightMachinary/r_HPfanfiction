Regrettably I can't write to save my life. Which is why I'm so grateful to all the fanfic authors who put themselves and their works out there for us to enjoy.

I would suggest you try the story Beginning to Live by TheIndigoRaven. The plot of that story is exactly what you are requesting. Only problem is it is a short story ~4.5K
