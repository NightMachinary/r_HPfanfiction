My story linkffn(The Coven of Albion) is pretty decent, I was really surprised by the follows and such. It's a run through an AU that is kind of like canon (though the plot has and will have significant divergences), but the antagonists are competent, the protagonists are proactive and not useless, and the pagan religious views of the characters who raise Harry (the many members of the Black family) play a crucial role in character development and plot progression.

Ignore the bot, I added a new chapter a week ago.
