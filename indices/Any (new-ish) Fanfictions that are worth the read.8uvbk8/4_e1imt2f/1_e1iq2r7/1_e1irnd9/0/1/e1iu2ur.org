How absurd. Just because you are unable to view the world as anything but black and white does not mean that the rest of us are the same.

Firstly, Sirius and Andromeda were raised by Blacks, and yet, became decent people.

Secondly, Harry was raised by terrible people himself in the books, was he not? He was raised by child abusing magic haters, and yet, he didn't become a bully or a magic hater. Therefore, there's no reason he would grow to dislike Hermione.

Thirdly, this is fanfiction. Even if we ignore the two main points above, the author can make other members of the Black family decent people as well.

Fourthly, being raised by a blood type does not make you that blood type. Harry would remain a half-blood. He wouldn't be a pure-blood purely because he was raised by them. Otherwise, he'd be considered a muggle(born) for being raised by muggles in the books.

Fifthly, I don't think there was any indication and this Harry would become dark.
