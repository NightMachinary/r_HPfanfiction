My headcanon about the Trace.

The Trace was created before the ISOS came into effect and its original purpose wasn't to limit children spellcasting, but to protect them. If offensive spells were cast around children, then you could assume that they are in danger and send someone to help.

The precision in terms of child's name wasn't needed (and maybe wasn't even possible to achieve) and offensive spells thrown both by the kid and around him are both warning signs.

Why not create a new spell?

There are fragments in canon that suggest that:

1. Spells can interfere with each other giving unpredictable results.
2. Enchantments are more powerful and prone to going out of control, the older they are.

So throwing a new, big spell that would largely overlap with old, big spell may be a pretty bad idea.
