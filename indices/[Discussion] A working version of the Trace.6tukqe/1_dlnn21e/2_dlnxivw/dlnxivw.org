About Lily from JKR's old site.

#+begin_quote
  In "Philosopher's Stone" Aunt Petunia says that Lily came back from Hogwarts with frog spawn in her pockets and turned teacups into rats. If this is true, why wasn't Lily expelled?

  Aunt Petunia is exaggerating a little; you have to allow for her state of mind when she started shrieking these things. However, just like her son, Lily was not averse to testing the limits of the Statute of Secrecy, so you can safely assume she will have had a few warning letters -- nothing too serious, though.

So it went like "you shouldn't be doing that, ok". Harry was treated seriously because Fudge wanted to get to him, otherwise it's probably largely handwaved unless someone breaks it constantly.
