It's clear that accidental magic is not contrary to the Reasonable Restriction on Underage Sorcery - otherwise the Ministry would have popped in on Harry multiple times in his childhood. It seems likely, therefore, that any pre-Hogwarts magic which is detected is assumed to be accidental magic and therefore not investigated. So that explains Hermione.

As for Lily, certain comments in OotP make it sound that the Ministry generally takes breaches of the Reasonable Restriction on Underage Sorcery quite lightly, with a slap on the wrist. Harry's trial was noted as being unusually harsh and formal, implying that normal procedure is somewhat more informal and forgiving.
