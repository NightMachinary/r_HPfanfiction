My bit of headcanon is that it is very much working as intended. We heard that Lily was showing her parents magic. Lily wasn't expelled from Hogwarts. Therefore I kinda fill-in-the-blanks by saying that the Trace is a relatively new invention, or at least its rigorous enforcement is, after the first Voldemort War.

It is working as intended because what it essentially does is pointing out magic use to the Ministry. I'm thinking of it as a Death Eater Quick Response system. If there is magic somewhere where no magic should be, Aurors get dispatched. In the present, if this magic use is in an area where only minors have magic, those minors get warnings.

What it ends up doing is protecting purebloods and half-bloods from a Trace offense, and points out muggleraised and muggleborn doing magic around non-magical folks. Its been designed as a tool to uphold the Statute of Secrecy, but ended up being a rather discriminatory tool. One that also seems to have a certain wiggle room. Hermione said she had tried out a few spells before entering the train. So I deduce that the Ministry lets the overexisted wandwaving of pre-first-year muggleborns slide. But once you heard of the prohibition of magic "during the summer", aka. when you're back where muggles could see you, you have been warned.

Anyway, my bit of fanon about the Trace.
