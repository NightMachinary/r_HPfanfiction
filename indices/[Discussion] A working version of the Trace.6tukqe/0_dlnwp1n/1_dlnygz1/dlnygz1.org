Yay Taure! I like to follow your logical trains of thought~ If I'm following you correctly, then I /think/ my idea fits with canon? Location of underage magic, check; no identity of caster, check; possible ways of analysing the spell cast, check. I didn't actually think it would line up quite that well, as it wasn't a priority when coming up with it. My main reason for posting here is to see people's opinions on it (especially if I've missed something glaringly obvious) before adding it to my fic. Do you touch on the Trace in any of your fics?
