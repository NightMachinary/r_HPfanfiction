There /is/ an interpretation which has all of canon fit together consistently, it's just that some people don't like it.

The interpretation in question:

1. The Trace is on people, not on wands/places.

2. The Ministry is able to detect what magic is cast around someone with the Trace, and the location where it was cast, but not who cast it.

3. The Ministry is not able to detect which particular person's Trace has fed them the information. All the Ministry gets is the spell cast and the location. They use other records about which magical people live in which locations to make assumptions over who has cast the magic in question. If the location is one which contains magical adults, they assume the magic was cast by an adult. When magic is detected at Privet Drive, they assume it was cast by Harry.

These 3 points account for every piece of information we have about the Trace from canon and are internally consistent. Point 3 is made necessary by Tom Riddle's murder of his family and his blaming it on Morfin Gaunt. For that to happen, it is necessary for the Ministry to not be aware that Tom Riddle was in the area, which means they cannot identify specific Traces.
