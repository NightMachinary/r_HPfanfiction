Harry was in a graveyard well outside any known wizard home where all sorts of nasty spells were cast. However, it was during the school year, so it may be that Mafalda wasn't attending the detector or something.

Another possible rule is that when spells are cast near someone with the Trace, the charm also does a check to see if an adult wizard or witch is present, in which case it doesn't bother reporting the magic.
