1. It's not clear that the Ministry uses the Trace to do anything other than enforce underage magic use. In particular, it does not appear that there are any systems in place to intervene in detected magic as it happens in a preventative fashion. Rather, magic use is responded to after the fact with what appears to be stock letters from a template. So there's nothing to explain in terms of the Ministry not rushing to the scene as soon as they see dangerous spells being cast there.

2. As you note, it's during the school year, when the vast majority of magical children are at Hogwarts where they are permitted to cast magic. I'm not sure if the department even really has a use during the school year (but again, the letters seem to be automatically generated anyway, at least to an extent).

3. In any case, due to point 3 above, the Ministry would have no idea which underage person was in the area and has no record of any living wizards in the area. They have no one to send a letter to, and thus no one to enforce against. So they'd ignore it anyway.
