I've seen both ways work. The writer Laventadorn writes her fem!harry as having a stag and it suits her sort of tomboyish, brash nature I think. More introspective or gentle, empathetic fem!harrys having a doe also makes sense. It's up to the writer to show what fits their vision of a fem Harry I reckon
