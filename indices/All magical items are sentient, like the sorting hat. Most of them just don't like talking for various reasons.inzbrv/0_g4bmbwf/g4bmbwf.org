I like to think the Sorting Hat and Gryffindor's Sword have a sort of rivalry, or an ongoing thousand-year argument:

*headmaster leaves the room*

Sword: Well that was a foolish thing to say.

Hat: Shut up. He asked for my advice and I gave it. Didn't hear you offering any advice.

Sword: Yes, because me suddenly talking would not be jarring in any way.

Hat: I swear, one of these days...

Sword: What are you going to do? Sit on someone's head at me?
