  Harry's left him for a desk job, citing concerns that he wants his kids to have a father and his wife to have a husband. But that's not dissuading Senior Auror Ron Weasley from dragging the new Head Auror back to where he belongs: investigating murdered magical creatures and vanishing witches and wizards. ---Auror mystery, Harry-Ron friendship, and canon ships.
