The author takes /way/ too many words to do very little. The humor is hit and miss too. I've been following this story since the beginning, and while it does have its moments, it's meandering and rather wearisome at times.

That said, it seems to have picked up a bit the last couple of chapters. I hope we get a tighter story now, with less bullshit.
