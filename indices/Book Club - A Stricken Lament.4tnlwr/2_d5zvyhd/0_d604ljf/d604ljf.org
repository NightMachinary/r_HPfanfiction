Thats an issue with a lot of stories. I've read a ton of post-battle fics that take about 200,000 words to get through the summer after the battle. It would be ok if there was some fast-moving plot involved but there often isn't.

One of the things I just realized about northumbrian that makes him so good is that he can do something similar (write 100k words that just cover a few months) and somehow make it incredibly fast-paced and engaging so your attention never slips.
