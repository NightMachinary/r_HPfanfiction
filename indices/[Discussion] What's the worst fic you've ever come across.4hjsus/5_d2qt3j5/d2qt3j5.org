Not the worst I've seen, but the worst novel-length one I've read:

Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness is by no means the worst fic out there. The author actually has a pretty good grasp of the English language by fanfiction standards. But the story is just super awkward at many points and in the end I just wondered why the fuck I wasted more than an entire afternoon on it. It's not even one of those cases where it is so bad it's funny.
