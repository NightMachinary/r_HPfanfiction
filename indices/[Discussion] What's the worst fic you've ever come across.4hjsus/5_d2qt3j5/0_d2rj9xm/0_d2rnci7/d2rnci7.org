Many characters just felt massively OOC for a fic that claims to be canon-compliant.

Neville often felt out of character. He shifts in and out of his canon personality, but the more he becomes a military leader, the more his canon personality vanishes. The author takes the "Army" far too literally. These are teenagers, not battle-hardened soldiers! Most of them have faced nothing worse than Umbridge in their lives. And yet, they're thinking and talking like walking clich√© soldiers.

Snape was absolutely ridiculously brutal. In that story, Snape sent Luna, Ginny and Neville to be eaten by werewolves in the Forbidden Forest. Also, he has Ernie and Neville beaten almost to their death and then hangs them from the ceiling bleeding for several days.

There's also an awkward scene in which Neville, Ernie and Terry torture Goyle as a revenge for raping Lavender. Seriously? Neville taking part in torturing anyone?

And then of course, there's the infamous execution scene. Basically, Neville and Hannah are sentenced to death by beheading, but Percy Weasley turns out to be a polyjuiced Viktor Krum who saves them.

And then, they don't leave the country. Nope, they go back to Hogwarts after somehow the ministry decides to accept the Imperius curse as an excuse.

Another thing was that the relations between the boys and the girls were quite awkward. In the Harry Potter novels, witches and wizards are equals. In The Year Of Darkness, it's mostly the guys doing the heroics, and the girls are usually either victims, healers or admirers. Mostly the latter.

I think trainwreck is the best description for that fic.
