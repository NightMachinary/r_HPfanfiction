Urgz, don't remind me... it features fellatio with 11 year olds. And the teachers and parents are all cool with that (really though, isn't this a huge red-flag for possible child abuse if an 11 year old girl thinks this is something she should do?).

If "The Real Us" were a book, I'd have thrown it into the corner in disgust at that point.
