C'mon guys, nothing can beat My Immortal in terms of worst fanfic ever. To do this day I'm still unsure whether she was trying to make it bad. Naturally, all the characters are goth (or goff, as she spells it), and of course Dumbledore walks in on her (the author writes herself as the main character) shagging. Not to mention that they're all obsessed with punk-pop music and her spelling is painfully horrendous. I'm not even going to being on the plot, or lack thereof. This fic is absolutely atrocious.
