I have read some really awful ones on purpose. Sometimes I see what doesn't work and think about if I see shadows of it in my own writing. Actually, my first story was a Dramione, and not because I ship them---or anyone, but I read one and thought, "That isn't how I would go about scaffolding that ship," and so I challenged myself to take a crack at it.
