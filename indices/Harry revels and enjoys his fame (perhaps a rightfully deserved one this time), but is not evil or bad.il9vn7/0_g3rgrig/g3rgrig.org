Story: Weeb [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12350003]]

Ravenclaw Harry is an anime fan and tries (unsuccessfully) to build a harem. Shifts time forward a little so Harry grows up with modern anime, and it's not just a retread of familiar moments in Canon. I like the fact that he barely interacts with Draco and Snape at all frankly. It's also finished, which is nice.
