I'm one of those who hated it, mostly because I read about 3 quarters of the first book and the first half of what I read was pretty cool, some great, fresh, original ideas.

But then I realized how much I hated the main character, how there was no real joy in magic, no sense of wonder in the exploration and discovery of Filory(?) and I suddenly couldn't read another sentence and I've never gone back to finish it or felt a sense of loss that I don't know what happens.

I thought about watching the TV series, although I heard the author had a lot of input and as it's his writing I hate I think I'll give it a miss.
