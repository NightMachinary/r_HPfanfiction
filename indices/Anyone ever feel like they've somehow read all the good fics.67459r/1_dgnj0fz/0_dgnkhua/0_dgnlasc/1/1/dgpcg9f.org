The thing about the TV series is that Quentin is no longer the main character. Instead, he's one of 4-5 main characters. That, coupled with the fact that the TV show isn't first person, makes Quentin a lot more interesting as a character. He's still annoying, but now you're not solely seeing the world through his eyes.

The TV show has its flaws, but I actually think it's very good, and very watchable. The first couple episodes are a little cheesy, but it really comes into its own very quickly. Also, if you haven't read the second and third books, then the TV show will feel completely new to you.

I did actually really like the books, although I partially agree with your assessment of them (personally I felt that was partly the point), but I can say without a doubt that the TV show is loads better.
