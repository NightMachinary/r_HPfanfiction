To jump on this train, there are a lot of buried gems of HP fanfiction (and fanfiction in general) that never really caught on for whatever reason. I really enjoyed linkffn(6036153) and it has fewer than 500 favorites. As was mentioned, the Dark Lord Never Died is INCREDIBLE, but has very few reviews/favorites despite being of publishable quality if a few names were changed.
