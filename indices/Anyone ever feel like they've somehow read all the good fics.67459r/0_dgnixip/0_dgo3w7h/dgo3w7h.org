  fics with more than 500 Favorites have no noticeable differences in quality
#+end_quote

What the fuck are you talking about? Filtering by # of favorites only removes the absolute lowest tier of trash, but quality still varies enormously even when looking at fics with thousands of reviews.

Favorites are largely a measure of how many people have read the story, which is driven by # of chapters and longevity. Certainly quality plays a role, but not to the extent that everything with a certain amount of favorites is within a narrow quality window.
