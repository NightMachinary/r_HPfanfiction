I don't know - that's also not a fair statement. Some of my HP fanfics are so niche that they have barely any reviews but I wrote nearly 20 pages in Word and the quality is pretty damn good, too!

A lot of the time 'popularity' is based on the tropes the story plays up, the character shipping, how often the chapters come out, and the connections an author may have with others.

To explain the last point: we're seeing a resurgence of the same authors being promoted the way Cassie Claire, Holly Black, AngieJ, etc were back in the early 2000s. /Everyone/ knew them. /Everyone/ read their stuff (and had valid opinions on it all ha!).
