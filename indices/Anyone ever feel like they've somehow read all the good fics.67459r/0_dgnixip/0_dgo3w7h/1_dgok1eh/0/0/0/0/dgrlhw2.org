Yeah, what this guy is saying is that if a fic has over x amount of favorites, it's GENERALLY ASSUMED it's above absoulute shit tier fics because it has x amount of favorites. It could still be shit but probably better than absolute shit, you dig? That doesn't mean below x is always absolute shit, just absolute shit rarely get praise and favorites... Well... Because they are absolute shit lmao
