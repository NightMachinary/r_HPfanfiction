I was referring to

  Filtering by # of favorites only removes the absolute lowest tier of trash

I agree 100% with the rest of your point regarding quality! I just find filtering by reviews (in the vein of, /ooo more reviews = better quality!!/) might remove trash, but it also then hides or misses out on niche fics that don't have the reviews but are quality.

If that makes sense? Not that it's fair or unfair - writing isn't fair??? and I don't think I'm calling out a whine that I don't have reviews for stories I write that I think deserve it - just that it's not the best method for filtering.
