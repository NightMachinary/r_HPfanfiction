I'm assuming you meant something along the lines of "The quality distribution for fics remains the same above 500 favorites" so a fic with 500 favorites is just as likely to be good or terrible as one with 5000, not that every fic with above 500 favorites is the same quality. I'm not sure how to state that simply without using math terms though.
