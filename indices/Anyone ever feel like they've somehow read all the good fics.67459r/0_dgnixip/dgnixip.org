IMO, fics with more than 500 Favorites have no noticeable differences in quality, and there are many great ones between 200 and 500 Favorites, such as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11419408;11773877).

Even below 200 Favorites, there are still a significant number of hidden gems, such as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]], linkffn(6989327;6432055;12076771).

Then there are always new, good authors. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5339762/White-Squirrel][White Squirrel]] only began writing in late 2013. Both [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/FloreatCastellum][FloreatCastellum]] really began in 2015. A new promising author, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4497458/mugglesftw][mugglesftw]], also known as [[/u/Full-Paragon]], began in late last Year.

As long as JKR kept tending to her franchise and people's interest, there will always be great new writers appearing on the scene. And with the fandom getting older, I actually expect the overall quality of HP fanfictions to improve.
