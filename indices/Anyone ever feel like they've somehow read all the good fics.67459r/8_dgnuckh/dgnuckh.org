Since you're looking for some new fics, here's a smattering of my favorites (across many different tropes, so hopefully you'll find something you like that you haven't read yet...this post got a lot longer than I expected it to...sorry for the length!)

*Severus/Hermione:*

*linkffn(For Hogwarts: A Regency Gamble by Subversa) *linkffn(Sin & Vice by mak5258)

*Severitus:*

*linkffn(The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville) *linkffn(Digging for the Bones by paganaidd) *linkffn(In Care Of by Fang's Fawn) *linkffn(Lily's Thorn by Gilana1) --updates are slow but pretty sure it's still updating

*Other:*

*linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks by Paimpoint) *linkffn(A Sorting Like No Other by Stargon1) -- a one-shot -- *linkao3(Session Transcripts by lastcrazyhorn) -- I don't think this is being updated any more, but still a great read. The summary is terrible, but the story is amazing.-- *linkffn(The Cupboard Under the Stairs by Stargon1)

*WBWL / Harry has a sibling (Most of these are pretty well known, but just in case you haven't read them yet)*

*linkffn(Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches) *linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man)

*Extreme(ish) AUs:*

*linkffn(Firebird's Son: Book I of the Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs) *linkffn(Gabriel by Shikatanai) -- don't think it's being updated anymore, but really really well-written-- *linkao3(Conviction by Dragongoddess13) *linkao3(Nobility by olivieblake)

*Slytherin Harry and/or Hermione:*

*linkao3(The King's Indian Attack by Nectere) *linkao3(The Anti-Heroine by cheshire_carroll) *linkffn(Mudsnake by Flye Autumne) *linkao3(Six Pomegranate Seeds by Seselt) -- the summary doesn't really do this story justice - it's hard to explain it without giving plot away, but it's definitely worth the read!--

*Snarry:*

*linkao3(A History of Magic by Prince Edwin)
