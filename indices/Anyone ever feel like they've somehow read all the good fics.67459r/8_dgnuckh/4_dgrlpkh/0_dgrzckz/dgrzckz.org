Yeah, I haven't found anything of that caliber.

If you're looking for dark (read: quite dark), you can try linkao3(The Anti-Heroine by cheshire_carroll). It's a little more Hermione-centric, but it also has Slytherin!Harry.

If you want something that has a similar sibling dynamic as Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, the closest thing I'd recommend is linkffn(Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches)

Hopefully you haven't read either of those yet!
