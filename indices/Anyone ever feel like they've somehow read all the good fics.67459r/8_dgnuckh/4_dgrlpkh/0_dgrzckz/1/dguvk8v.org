That would never have happened if Dumbledore had been a Slytherin! (Within context of some important person yelling DIRECTLY AT Dumbledore)

Then, annoyed with his own annoyance (Harry thinks to himself)

First fanfic I'm reading ironically. That prince of syltherin fic has so many of these within the first chapter it's a meme at this point. Perfect example of how NOT to do edgy. The title is good though lmao.

*AUTHORS NOTE*

I freely confess that I can't write like an 11-year-old worth a damn and at a certain point I just gave up and handwaved it away with a magical explanation for why children this young were so well-spoken. For one thing, there is a good bit of humor as well as drama in this work, and frankly, 11-year-olds aren't generally very witty. If 11-year-olds who frequently talk like well-educated and occasionally smart-ass /14-year-olds/ is a complete deal-breaker for you, you should probably move along.

LMAO so much cringe inside a SINGLE one of the like sozen author notes from the first chapter. This author LMAO those three years made all the difference!
