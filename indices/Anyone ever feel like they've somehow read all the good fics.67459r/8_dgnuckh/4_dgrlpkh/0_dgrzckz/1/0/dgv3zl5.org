Wow, that's a lot of hate. I, as well as the nearly 7,000 people (as of posting this comment) who follow this story definitely disagree with you. /Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin/ is one of the better fanfictions on the site. In fact, sir, I would like to see you attempt to do better, which I highly doubt given the numerous typographical errors and poor sentence structure in your post. Furthermore, if you can indeed read, you would notice the author's notes were the exception, not the rule. By reading further into the story, you would discover why approximately seven thousand people have followed it. I sincerely hope you do read more of it and realize the fallacy in your claims.
