Have you ever watched a movie that grossed over 100 million USD and thought to yourself: "WOW, I didn't like the movie for: x, y, z; but I've never made a movie in my life, so it's probably just my lack of having able to OR ABILITY TO make a 100 million USD gross film. Had it not been for my lack of creative talent I might have been able to see the qualities of this film for what they are, GENIUS!"

When thinking of a movie, it's easy to pick Adam Sandler films when making this thought, or just imagine Paul blart Mall cop 1 2 or 3. Okay maybe 3 isn't a thing but still.

. . . So no, I don't have to know how to spell or even write to judge someone else's work, maybe having the ability to write gives you credibily, MAYBE; but not as much as just being able to reason and think about something logically. . . . . Anyways, thanks for the responce ;)
