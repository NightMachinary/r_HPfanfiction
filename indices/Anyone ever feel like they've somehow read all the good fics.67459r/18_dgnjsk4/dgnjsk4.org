I definitely feel the same way. Most new authors are complete garbage and have no intention to make a single magnum opus, instead of attempting to make several garbage fics that can barely read like it takes place in the HPWorld. I find that even the fics I used to like feel a bit boring now (Example: On Way To Greatness, Forging the Sword, and pretty much all the other four to five stars on DLP). Maybe my tastes are too refined compared to what they used to be, but honestly, a lot of literary fiction that has magic reads like an HPfanfic with different names anyways.
