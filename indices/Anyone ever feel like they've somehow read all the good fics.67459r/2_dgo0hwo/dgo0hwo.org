I really liked NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series. It's 7 different fics about his Hogwarts years, and it introduces a lot of concepts and storylines i haven't seen done anywhere else. If you can get past the first part which is mainly setting up plot points(it's also the shortest) the rest is pretty good. linkffn(8417562)
