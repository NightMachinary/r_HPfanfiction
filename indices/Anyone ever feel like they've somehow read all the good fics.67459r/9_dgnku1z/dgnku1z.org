Yeah, I like Snape as Harry's mentor/father and I feel like I've read pretty much of them that are good. If I haven't read it I've probably tried and given up because of bashing and/or poor writing. I'll delve into stuff that sounds interesting, but Severitis-type fics are my favorite and it seems like their heyday is over.
