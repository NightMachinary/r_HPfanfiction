I usually reach out for that series that I've been putting off for whatever reason. Most recently it was The Pureblood Pretense. I initially was wary because I think the idea of a girl pretending to be a boy was a bit cheesy(I used to read a lot of trashy manga), and dropped it early in the first chapter where there's a scene of doubletalk with Pansy. I thought it was going to be another politics fic, but I was totally wrong. Great AU, and the series is now my favourite fem harry fic, and top 5 of all time.
