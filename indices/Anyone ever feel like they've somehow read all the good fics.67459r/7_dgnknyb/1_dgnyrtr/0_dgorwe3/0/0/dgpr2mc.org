Haven't read the first one yet. Read through 28 chapters of the second- my issue (apart from it being a little too well-acquainted with fanon- Peruvian Darkness Powder, everyone knowing the prophecy, arithmancy for spell creation, etc.) Voldemort isn't demonstrably more intelligent or pragmatic than in canon: the first two deaths are basically pure luck to change Harry's personality. Dobby's quidditch/wall incident seems odd in light of the earlier conversation with Harry, for example.

It's honestly so prevalent- Harry uses warming charms (which aren't canon), but then later talks about learning them again in the context of the tournament. Harry talks about never having interacted with Skeeter, but she's mentioned much earlier. The initial Oliver relationship is nice, but he's not even mentioned once after that first reset first year.

It's probably being written quickly, but even a round of editing wouldn't be sufficient for the larger issues of the fic.
