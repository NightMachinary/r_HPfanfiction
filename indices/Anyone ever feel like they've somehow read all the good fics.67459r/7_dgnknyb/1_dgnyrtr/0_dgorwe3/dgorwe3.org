How are these? The first seems to be Harry/Multi, and we all know how bad those tend to be. Is the second actually a good Groundhog Day fic? The only HP one I've read and enjoyed was a Hermione/Severus fic (Edit: And a "Harry goes crazy" oneshot). (Second Edit: And a lot set in a single loop after multiple others)
