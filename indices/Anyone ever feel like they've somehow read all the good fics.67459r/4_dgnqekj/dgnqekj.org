Whenever I feel like this, I ruffle through people's rec lists with a specific trope in mind. For example, time travel. There's rec lists everywhere from tumblr, to dark lord potter forums, to reddit, to live journal. Sometimes I just search through the bookmarks or other works of an author I liked. There's also sifting through the newest works on ao3, usually filtered so only the newest completed works show or something. But a lot of the time, there's a lot of really good fics that are incomplete, but make up for it by being really long already.

Remember, really good stories don't rely on length. The first Harry Potter book is about 80k words (75k if I remember correctly.) Don't refuse something just because its not an epic, unless you're only interested in epics. Then I can understand.
