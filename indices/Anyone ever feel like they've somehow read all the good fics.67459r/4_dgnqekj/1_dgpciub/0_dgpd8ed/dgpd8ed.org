Those are pretty much it. Usually I just google whatever I'm looking for + rec list because all of these websites have awful search functions. For example: "Harry Potter Time Travel Rec List"

Actually, [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] has a lot of threads with rec lists from authors and readers who have pretty strict tastes. Since HP is such a big fandom, you don't even have to search for threads about HP, just the general "What's the best fanfic you've ever read?" threads.

[Here](fics_you_could_show_a_professor) and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/4ttifu/what_are_the_top_5_fanfiction_you_have_ever_read/][Here]] are two threads I bookmarked a while ago (don't exactly remember why, but I'm sure they have something HP related.)
