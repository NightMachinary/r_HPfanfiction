Yes, I do. But I always find a new 'good' fic I haven't read. Recently for example I read [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9525716/chapters/21539333][Tell Brave Deeds of War]] which is now up there with some of my favourites.

  There's a war going on, and Death Eaters have taken Hogwarts. Michael isn't brave; Terry isn't wise; Anthony isn't a leader. Ravenclaws aren't meant to be rebels, but then again nothing else this year is normal. There's a war going on, and it's time that they figured out what's right, what's easy, and what they want to risk.
