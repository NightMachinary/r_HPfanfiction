  Spider-Man's life has never been easy, but what if one day a tournament began with stakes so high that it could mean the absolute destruction of the world as he knew it ? Watch as he and his two unlikely allies strive to reach the top! 5th in the LIAG series! Can be read alone! Crack-with-plot! Spidey/harem, X-23/femharem, eventual Spidey/X-23.
