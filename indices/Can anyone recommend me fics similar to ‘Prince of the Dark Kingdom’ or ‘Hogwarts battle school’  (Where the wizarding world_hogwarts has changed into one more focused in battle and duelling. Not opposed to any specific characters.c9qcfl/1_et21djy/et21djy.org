I think a good match would probably be linkffn(Reign of the Serpent), where Salazar basically became king of Britain and changed the rules of Western Europe.

You might also like linkffn(Skitterleap), an AU that depicts a world where Grindelwald defeated Dumbledore, and now Harry is a newly appointed soldier in Grindelwald's army on the eastern front.
