Ah, this is another one of those simple things that I've forgotten all about. Thanks for reminding me!

  I've always liked the idea of Flitwick and Harry interacting more. I think if he'd been sent to collect Harry he would've been able to encourage Harry's curiosity for magic, and we might've found ourselves with a Harry who has that same love of magic and desire to learn everything he can about it and himself !

Magic /is/ something to be curious about. That's one thing that has always driven me a little nuts about the books -- the lack of questions about something so fantastic. (But heavy worldbuilding is not what JKR was going for, and I love the series as-is.)

Fics like that would also put the wonder back into magic, I think, presenting it as something to be delved into and discovered rather than spammed like video game combos.
