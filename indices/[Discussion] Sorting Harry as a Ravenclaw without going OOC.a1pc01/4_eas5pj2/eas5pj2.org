The hat seems to sort by potential in some cases (Gryffindor, for example. I doubt many children do anything massively brave before school, esp the muggle-raised ones. Bravery becomes much more obvious when you're in a dangerous magical world where your life is at stake) and I've always thought Harry could've went any way depending on his intro to the magical world.

He's got the curiosity and interest in magic and learning about it before he starts Hogwarts, and in canon it sort of falls to the wayside as he's surrounded by Ron who doesn't have the same curiosity, being pureblood, and Hermione who perhaps has the interest but initially poor social skills that means it's unlikely Harry would've turned to her with his questions. Hagrid is lovely, of course, but was expelled early on and doesn't seem interested in academics. I think if Harry was collected from the Dursley's by a professor or met someone else on the train who would encourage his curiosity he could've went there easily ! I've always liked the idea of Flitwick and Harry interacting more. I think if he'd been sent to collect Harry he would've been able to encourage Harry's curiosity for magic, and we might've found ourselves with a Harry who has that same love of magic and desire to learn everything he can about it and himself ! the idea of him delving into magic because it's so different from the Dursleys and everything they've taught him makes sense to me, and I think if Harry had one teacher who pushed him academically and encouraged him to do his best he would've ended up pretty different !
