Thanks, those are some really great points and ideas!

Now it's much easier to see how he could go into Ravenclaw. To go off your first example, his interest in his textbooks could easily led to more curiosity about magic, how it works, etc. -- he might ask more technical questions of Ron when he's on the Express, or maybe he'd be morbidly curious enough to ask Hermione exactly what she's read about him.

  Additionally, we also know that the Dursleys weren't keen on asking questions - maybe the Hat sees this as an opportunity to nurture a yet unexplored spark of curiosity.

That's a neat idea, and one I don't think I've seen before. I can see a Harry who wants to ask questions, is just brimming with them, but doesn't, and the Sorting Hat picks that up.

  Finally, Harry is fairly sassy, which can speak to wit and a quick mind as well. The "no need to call me sir" line comes to mind.

The thought of Harry being sorted into Ravenclaw for his smartass streak is hilarious.
