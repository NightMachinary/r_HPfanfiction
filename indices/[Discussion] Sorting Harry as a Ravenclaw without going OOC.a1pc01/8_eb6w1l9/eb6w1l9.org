Why would this happen?

Seriously, (canon) Harry doesn't have the qualities for this house! He doesn't want to know stuff just because (he either slouches/slacks off with (Mo-)Ron and just performs just above average (practically, his writen stuff is probably worse!) or learns stuff he truly thinks he needs (Patronus charm, stuff for the tournament etc.), but not a iota more!)! He lacks curiousity, sense of wounder! Frankly Harry is kind of the guy stuff happens to, he doesn't do much on his own :(
