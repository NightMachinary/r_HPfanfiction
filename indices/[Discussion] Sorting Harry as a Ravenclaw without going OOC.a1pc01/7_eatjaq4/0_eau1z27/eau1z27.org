Those are definitely good ways to go about getting him into another house -- it's only natural that some people would mention the negative stuff about Gryffindor, especially if they favor (or are in) other houses. Maybe Harry could even see the brashness of Gryffindor as a little too similar to his cousin, Dudley, if he ran into someone from that house who was rude or something.
