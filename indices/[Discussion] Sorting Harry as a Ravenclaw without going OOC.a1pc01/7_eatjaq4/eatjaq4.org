I can't see Harry being sorted into Ravenclaw naturally without him being too OOC. To stay canon Harry, he needs something to push him there. He decided against Slytherin mostly because he was exposed to people saying negative things about Slytherin. He needs to be exposed to people extolling the negatives of Gryffindor as well.

I'm imagining the sorting starting the same- the hat recommending Slytherin and Harry going, "Not Slytherin!" Then the sorting hat suggests Gryffindor. "No, not Gryffindor!" He eventually convinces the hat he wants neither house. After that, I'd say it's a toss up between Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw. You could easily have him in either house if it was between those two and it wouldn't seem OOC.
