Thanks for pointing out Luna -- that's such an obvious thing that I can't believe I missed it. You're very right, too, that Ravenclaw students don't need to be like Hermione; intelligence comes in many forms.

It's been a while since I've re-read the books, and I'd /knew/ I'd forgotten things like that. Good thing this sub exists!
