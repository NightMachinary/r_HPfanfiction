In my mind the hat sorts more by attitude and values than by behaviour or skills. Draco is proof of that since he shows lots of the brazenness of Gryffindor and very little cunning. So you don't need to make Harry super intelligent to have him in Ravenclaw, just make him care about gaining knowledge about something more than anything else (maybe he's really obsessed with finding out things about his family history)
