He's fairly witty at times in the books, unlike the movies. Harry is actually one of the few characters who would fit in any house without an issue---although I think the some of the older Slytherins, whose parents may have been arrested after the fall of Voldemort, would create real issues as would Snape---and I feel like his personality would clash with what little we see of Zacharias Smith and Justin Finch Fletchly in Hufflepuff. But there's definitely a hint that he wants to do the work, it's just the Dursleys lock up his supplies, and when something interests him he follows through---and that is a Ravenclaw quality.

Also, Flitwick imo is one of the best professors in the book, too. Enough has been said about Snape's teaching, and as much as I love Minerva she sent a bunch of 11 year olds out to a forest at night and takes obscene amounts of points off. Pomona looks the other way while her entire house bullies Harry. Flitwick, on the other hand, seems warm and caring, and generally seems to treat all the houses equally. If Flitwick introduced him to the wizarding world, I could see him wanting to follow him into Ravenclaw.

But if we're talking about characters in general without any of the baggage of family tradition or house reputations....

I would say Draco is a total Hufflepuff or Gryffindor, Hermione is a Slytherin to the bone in some ways, Ron is a Slytherin or Ravenclaw, and the twins would be equally suited to Slytherin as they would Gryffindor.
