Um... ambition and cunning? Walk With Me....

Bill (and Charlie) deliberately found jobs that took them out of the country, even though they are shown to like their family. And have connections that would let them be in those jobs while being in the same country. Justified when Bill, going against marriage custom, has his family, not the bride's, prepare the wedding. His mother takes his return to Britain as a given, and spends a sizeable part of book 7 complaining about how Bill couldn't find a nice English girl... while preparing his freaking wedding! It quite dramatically shows that Bill finding out-of- country employment was brilliant, bold... and cunning. Whether Charlie thought of the same thing himself, gave Bill the idea, or coordinated with him, we don't know. We do though, see enough of Bill in action, to recognize the cunning in the former Head Boy.

I will assume that the ambitions of fellow Head Boy Percy, were made clear enough from the books, and from other characters comments about him.

In a similar vein, as a reminder: Fred and George deliberately tanked their OWL and NEWT tests in order to force their mom to stop constantly talking about them going into Ministry work. They still did the school work - and more - to learn how to make all of their joke products. And except for Lee, Angelina, Alicia and Harry (that is, those people constantly around them THAT AREN'T THEIR FAMILY), no one suspected they would be the next Zonko's... except every Weasley older than them.

Also, don't forget Ginny sneaking out and practising broom flying, with no one noticing... at least, no one said they noticed her at it.

Then there's the real surprising one: Arthur. Possibly the safest post in Magical Law Enforcement (you did recall MMA is part of MLA, trees), Arthur Weasley is in a remarkably perfect-for-him job, for a man that doesn't know the function of a rubber duck. Who collects electric plugs, but not their attached cords. Who has a working, flying, invisibility-enabled Ford Anglia at his home (well, had, as of book 2). Who is perfectly positioned to know all of the political tricks going on, but not to get caught up in them. Who kept his job through the Voldemort takeover.

Please, someone tell me how the longest- serving department head will not be a shoe-in to replace interim Minister Shacklebolt. Then, tell me how it shows no ambition or cunning to make everyone you know see you as the obvious choice for Minister of Magic.

I'm just saying that these folks have too much success at their ambitions to not be ambitious. Also, as book 1 showed us, it's not unthinkable that someone who ought to be in Slytherin would deliberately choose not to go there.
