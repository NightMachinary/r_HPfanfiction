This must be where a lot of fics are getting their characterization from, because everyone has been commenting on stuff that's completely slipped my mind.

While also being a duellist! And with a little tweaking -- his age is never mentioned, so it could work -- a story could easily say, oh, right, he went to school around the same time as Dumbledore, and I can see the two of them being friends since Dumbledore was a bit of an outcast himself before he got to Hogwarts.

Honestly, Flitwick has so much potential for character expansion that it's disappointing there aren't a lot more Ravenclaw-centric fics out there.
