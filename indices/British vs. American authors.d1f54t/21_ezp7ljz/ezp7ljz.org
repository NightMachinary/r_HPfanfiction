I'm not British, but I noticed that Americanisms tend to annoy me if there's already something I dislike in a fic. Then I'l notice every single mention of candy, vacation and fall. Another thing is that when ,say, Hermione's father says fall, it feels almost like author is telling their readers they don't care that's a British series and that fall is definitely autumn. To me it's the same when they say they don't want their fic to be a work of art. I do think they should care about the quality of their work, particularly when I've seen authors removing all the gottens from their fics or asking where an elderly couple is likely to have a flat in UK. And I believe authors can always ask for help. But I remember seeing a fridge referred to as an ice-box several times (and I believe that's an American thing) and happily ignored it because the fic was very good.
