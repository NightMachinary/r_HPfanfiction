I'm not one who's heavy on the minor british aspects of the story myself - having read it first in another language, and then living in the US, it's nice to have to make it 'feel' like it's in the UK - but it's by no means a deal breaker unless it's really in your face (eg - Harry talking like he's an american teenager or something).

Writing quality and prompts and all that are much more important. Like 'Jumper vs sweater' or 'Sofa vs couch' makes 0 difference to me, and won't impact my enjoyment of a fic at all. And those who /do/ care intensely about that will almost certainly find a failure that slipped through and stomp off angrily.

So I'd say just do a best efforts setup, and imagine if you think it'd sound weird in a british voice. Oh, though I would note that for things like government and other institutions that's different IMO.
