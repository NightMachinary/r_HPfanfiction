I'm really not bothered if minor American jargon gets in: candy or whatever other nouns that aren't quite the same for Brits.

What does bother me is "figuring out" instead of "working out" or "resolving" or clearing up" something, especially in dialogue. Yes, British people do use this phrase, but I feel it's more informal and casual than is fitting to the likes of McGonagall, Snape, Dumbledore etc. I don't mind the narrator using it so much, but it really takes me out of otherwise perfectly good fics when this phrase just drops into a paragraph and clashes with the register.

Like if there were subtle hints before that the author was American, "figuring out" stuff left and right will be a dead giveaway. Doesn't necessarily stop me reading though.
