English isn't my first language, so there are probably a lot of subtle nuances i miss when it comes to British VS American... that said, it's usually VERY blatant when an author is American and forgets that the HP series takes place in the UK.

You have classic blunders like "Mom" (even American authors who know that "Mum" is the correct word sometimes slip up) and the ever-present pancakes with maple syrup for breakfast... or talking about "cookies" when they mean "biscuits" or "pants" when they mean "trousers" or "candy" when they mean "sweets"... but also things like baseball analogies as euphemisms for sex. I read one fic that tried to use Quidditch analogies instead, and it was ALL THE CRINGE to read Harry talking about "catching the snitch with Ginny.".
