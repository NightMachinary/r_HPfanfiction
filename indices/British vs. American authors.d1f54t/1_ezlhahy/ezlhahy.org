The one thing that bugs me the most is that a lot of authors (regardless of nationality) seem to overlook teenagers and how vulgar they are. Like, no way is a 15 year old Harry going to call Draco a dork, a dummy or just an idiot. Teens in general (not sure if British teens are worse) are gonna call him a nonce, a twathead or some other combination. And it varies. A lot. When I was younger, a lot of the time we just got a swear word and put another word next to it. And banter, like GOOD banter is hard to find. I used to call my friends cunts all the time. That's whats so great about British humour. It is so damning and insulting. If u can't take a joke then what the fuck are you doing in the UK.
