Maybe. But I've like talked to very few British people and I never noticed their slang too much (I don't care if they use trousers or chips or whatever) but things like arsehole or saying bloody or whatever British only slang words I have just never heard authentically. And it's completely foreign to how it is where I'm from. If you were saying some of this British slang from where I'm from you'd probably get made fun of it's just that different to what we talk like in America
