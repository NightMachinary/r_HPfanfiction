I wouldn't click out of a story because they sound British. I don't think it really matters honestly, and I didn't know it mattered to anyone until this thread where apparently it matters very much to people so TIL.

All I'm saying is, as an Americanthat never hears that British slang it always sounds very stupid when I hear/see it. Always makes me pause or cringe a bit because it's just so un-American which is where I've lived all my life. I don't even know any British people irl so I've never heard their slang in authentic conversation. So really whenever I see it in media or FanFiction it always sticks out and very jarring to me, but it's just whatever honestly it doesn't have anything to do with if the story is good or not, just like I would think that Americanisms in FanFiction should just be looked aside and not matter to a stories quality at all
