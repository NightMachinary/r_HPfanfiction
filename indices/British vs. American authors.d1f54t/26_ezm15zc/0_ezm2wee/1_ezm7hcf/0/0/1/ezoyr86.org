  as an Americanthat never hears that British slang it always sounds very stupid when I hear/see it
#+end_quote

This is how I feel whenever I hear/see American English. Half your language is baby-talk, anyway.

  Always makes me pause or cringe a bit because it's just so un-American

There's a whole world outside America, and America /isn't/ great. Being an arrogant bell-end distances you even further from greatness.

  So really whenever I see it in media or FanFiction it always sticks out and very jarring to me
#+end_quote

Stop consuming those media then.

  but it's just whatever honestly it doesn't have anything to do with if the story is good or not, just like I would think that Americanisms in FanFiction should just be looked aside and not matter to a stories quality at all
#+end_quote

So, hypothetically, how do you think you would take it if an English writer did a fanfic based on, say, The Big Bang Theory, but wrote it with mostly English colloquialisms but with the occasional mis-used Americanism in there?
