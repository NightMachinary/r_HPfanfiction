By what token? Bad American attempts at British English colloqualisms are, after all, bad attempts at translating into another language. If I was reading a story written in English by a Chinese guy with only two years' part-time education in English, I'd probably put that down if it misused words too often, too.

It's not so much about the setting. It's just /please learn our fucking language if you're going to try and write in it/.

There have been actual novels published that are like this, too. I read /The Paper Magician/ trilogy last year, and while I thought the story was alright (though the MC was a bit of a Mary-Sue, and it was all a bit cutesy), the author had really munged early 1900s language and culture up. There's a point in the first one where the main character is making biscuits and gravy for breakfast. In England. In 1903. There's another point where the owner of the house she's staying at gives her some "bills" to do the weekly grocery shopping - when in the UK we call them "notes", and in 1903 there were no notes smaller than £5, and £5 would have kept you richly fed for about three months. There was something about school in there too - 1903 people left school between 10 and 13 (depending on preference), but in the book, the MC left at about 17. It's because I have a high tolerance regarding suspension of disbelief that I carried on.
