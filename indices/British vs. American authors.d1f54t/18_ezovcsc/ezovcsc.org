Most annoying is when English colloqiualisms are misused. I read one recently (or it might be earlier in the one I'm rading now) that infuriated me when the author had written something like "kip home for a sleep". "Kip" means "nap", but this author had used it in place of "nip", which is to quickly go somewhere - as in "I forgot my keys, I'll nip back and get them".

Maybe someone ought to compile a list of British slang terms and how they're used? Hang on ("wait a moment"), there's Urban Dictionary - doesn't that do it?
