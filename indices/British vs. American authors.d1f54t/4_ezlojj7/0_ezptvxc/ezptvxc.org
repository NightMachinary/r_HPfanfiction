I once read a fic where Harry supported Minnesota Wolves and went to their games. Worse foc ever, Basketball isnt really that big here in the UK, it's mostly FOOTBALL (not "soccer")

Oh and he had a shouting match with Dean saying how Soccer is a bad sport and how West Ham are an "ass" team.

I mean he is not wrong but it's good he didnt talk about Liverpool FC or else I woulda flipped. Hard.
