Every other "Harry visits the Burrow" scene in fic I've read has Molly Weasley serving pancakes with syrup for breakfast. Or waffles.

Pancakes and syrup aren't an everyday British breakfast food compared to stuff like Weetabix or egg and toast. Even the books showed that the nicest Weasley breakfasts were the standard fry-up.

Oh, and in fic, everyone drinks coffee at breakfast. Fanon Snape is a coffee addict.
