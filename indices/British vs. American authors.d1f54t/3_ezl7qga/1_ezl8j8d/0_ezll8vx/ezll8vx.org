Wait, do brits not drink coffee? Or are you just saying that everyone drinking coffee would be the problem? (It's been awhile since I've been to London, so I honestly can't remember). I realize that tea is the standard, but my understanding was that people do drink coffee in England. I guess I always just assumed that there were people there that preferred coffee in nearly any country even if that wasn't the norm.

For example, I am American and I don't drink coffee, but I drink tea regularly and have an electric kettle in my house and my office (and in my camping supplies). And while, I'm not the norm by any means, I've met enough other Americans that do that that it's not completely crazy or out there - about half my office at work prefers tea. So, I guess I thought coffee drinkers in the UK would be more like tea drinkers in the US - more like a smaller subset of people, but that there would still be people that held that preference.
