I can't name any specifics, but in previous threads that have brought up this topic, the sentiment I've seen is that /any/ Americanism immediately makes certain readers drop a fic. I've read that idea several times in this subreddit alone and that hurts, that people wouldn't give a story a try just because the author isn't British.
