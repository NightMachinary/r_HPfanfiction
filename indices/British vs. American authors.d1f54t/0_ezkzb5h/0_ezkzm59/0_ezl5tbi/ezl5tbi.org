For me, dropping a story for egregious Americanisms is a "straw that broke the camel's back" situation. It usually happens because of a string of other reasons - bad spelling and grammar, improper use of punctuation, unrealistic dialogue for eleven year olds, rampant use of derogatory names like "Voldeshorts" and "Dumblefuck", and referring to the Killing Curse as "the A.K.".

I would overlook "Mom" instead of "Mum"s and other minor Americanisms as long as everything else is okay. Minor is fine. Just don't make Harry and his pals sound like the cast of Team America.
