Absolutely this. Americanisms do jump out at me, but I wouldn't quit an otherwise good story for them (and would always be happy to Britpick for a good author who was open to the help on that front).

However a mediocre story will become unreadable when the worry about healthcare costs and endless pancakes for breakfast and Honeydukes' candy and me getting very confused over whether they're referring to American or British pants builds up.
