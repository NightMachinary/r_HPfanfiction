With over 800,000 HP fanfictions out there, why should we force ourselves to read something that we aren't enjoying? Wouldn't our time be better spent looking for something we truly love? I don't single it out as the worst sin a writer can make, because I don't see it as anything different from the list of other considerations I keep in mind when deciding to continue reading a fic whose first chapter I just finished.

- Spelling, grammar, punctuation

- Plot

- Dialogue, characterization, worldbuilding

- Use of fanon tropes

- Pacing, station re-hashing

- Romance pairings

- OC's

Maybe you don't care to get selective about what fics you want your spend your time on, but some of us do.

...Or hey, maybe I'm just a mean old crotchety Picky Patty because I don't like fics where Harry's emerald orbs are mentioned every time he looks at something.
