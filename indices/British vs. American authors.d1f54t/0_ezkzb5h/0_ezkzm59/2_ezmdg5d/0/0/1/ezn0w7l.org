People are going to like what they like. You can't make people start liking what you like, that's just the way things are. It's similar to the "No Slash" issue, which people are going to be stubborn about no matter what. I think it's silly, especially when the double standards kick in ("M/M slash is gross, F/F is fine!"), but I'm not going to try and change people's minds if that's what they're set on.

In my case, I'm picky about Americanisms because the Harry Potter universe was my form of escapism as a child and young teenager. I loved the British setting, the magical whimsy, and the aesthetic that JKR built - because that was a whole different world away from my own life. In the present day, that's what pulls me in and immerses me into a fanfic story. When fanfiction doesn't give me that, I don't enjoy it as much.

Everyone likes different things for different reasons.
