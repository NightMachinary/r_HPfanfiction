As it's been said before, it's usually a combination of things that make people drop fics. Bad grammar and spelling is a really good way to give the reader a headache. And when the plot /seems/ mediocre you generally don't want to torture yourself hoping that it becomes better (there are extremely rare cases where the plot is worth the grammar issues but those are also extremely subjective).
