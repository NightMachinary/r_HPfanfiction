  any Americanism immediately makes certain readers drop a fic

I'd drop a fic if the author plainly didn't give a damn, did no research and filled a story with crap like Harry eating waffles for breakfast, skateboarding to the mall where he eats candy, hangs out with Hank, Ched and Cletus and then goes to Walmart.

If someone isn't even going to try to write, I'm not going to bother reading.
