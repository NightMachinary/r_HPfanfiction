As long as the characters' lines don't sound ridiculous when imagining them spoken with a British accent, I'd say you're alright. Best to avoid the obvious "candy" vs. "sweets"-type errors in dialogue, as well, but I won't judge you by it.

The main thing, at any rate, is that while there are good reasons to try to britpick your dialogues, it's utterly pointless to do so for the narration unless you're specifically trying to mimic Rowling's writing style, which few people do. So you're an American narrator telling a story about British people; where's the issue?
