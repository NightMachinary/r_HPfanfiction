I'm British but I feel that we're I am in the south west we have a completely different culture. “Fuck” is the go to swear word and shit is thrown about if you slip or drop something. Seeing as I go to a public(not state)/private school(not sure what you call them)that means the culture is different again. However, some Americanisms I really don't like such as ‘pants' because trousers are trouser and pants are boxers or knickers depending.
