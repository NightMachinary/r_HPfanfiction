You realize that social sensibilities have changed since the '90s, right? These days, casual homophobia isn't something people bring into the conversation just for the sake of Realism Brownie Points, because people are aware of the effect and associations certain, formerly common, words hold.

If words like that were used in modern entertainment fiction published in this day and age, the audience would have the expectation that its repercussions, emotional impact, and its use in repressing minorities would be explored. Not just because the author needed an insult, and "that's what people said back then".
