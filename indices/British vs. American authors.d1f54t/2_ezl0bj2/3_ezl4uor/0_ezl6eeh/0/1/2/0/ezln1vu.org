You can call them "fee-fees" and call me a soymilk connoisseur, but I still believe that people are entitled to be treated with a minimum of compassion and dignity.

And that goes for the books - slurs aren't used just to hurt the characters' fee-fees. They're not just there to make the bullying feel realistic, or to make the dialogue punch a bit harder, but are shown to have real, tangible consequences.

Notice how JK Rowling uses the slur "mudblood" in the books. It's not used gratuitously, but when it /is/ used, it's used to demonstrate the character of the kind of person who uses it (Draco Malfoy, Walburga Black, Marvolo Gaunt), and how the characters react to it, and the impact it has on them emotionally. The first time it's used in the books, the Gryffindor quidditch team got into a brawl over it. When Kreacher uses it, Sirius and the Order yell at him about it, and it results in him dropping the information about the OotP's DoM operations to Narcissa Malfoy.
