No you don't. If it's a word that is just thrown around like the dude above said, then you can use it in your character's dialogue without having to surround it with other characters acting like they just dropped a bomb. You can't ask writers to refrain from having dialogue as realistic as possible for any reason, since it's just dialogue from fictional characters.
