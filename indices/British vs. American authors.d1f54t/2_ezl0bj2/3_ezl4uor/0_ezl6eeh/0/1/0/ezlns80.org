Agreed. It's only really useful when it's /meant/ to have that huge impact. Like, if you have a gay Draco and Lucius is a huge homophobe and is disowning him and there's a big rant scene where Draco gets verbally torn down, I can see Lucius using the term faggot intentionally, with the author knowing the gut reaction of the reader and it driving the point home how terrible Lucius is being and how much you should be feeling sorry for Draco. That kind of thing. It should never be used as a casual tease between friends.
