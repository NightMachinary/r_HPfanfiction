No, because Jew is not an insult. You hear it venomously spat occasionally, but I always wonder where the insult is supposed to be. Jews kicked arse and took names in the past 70 years, so it is as much as an insult as "hung" in my book. Always found it confusing when someone used it maliciously, especially since religion is a choice.
