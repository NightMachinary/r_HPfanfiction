  because they are meant to be insults?

If it fits the situation, yes. Malfoy will not care about social niceties, as is shown in canon. So if I were ever to write a gay character, he'd be using it 24/7 against that character. BUT, I always found the English fixation on single words weird because they do not seem very impactful to me. I mean, you can use them, but IMO "bastard who sucks the unwashed dick of a disease-ridden hobo" is way more impactful than the singular slur, which makes the slur the weaker choice and therefore not very useful while insulting someone. But maybe that's just my Polish side shining through since the Polish language allows you to create well-flowing, nearly endless chains of insults by combining them.
