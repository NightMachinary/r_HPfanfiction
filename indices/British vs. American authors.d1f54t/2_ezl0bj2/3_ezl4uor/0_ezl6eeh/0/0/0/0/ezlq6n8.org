Sorry - you're right, I missed that in the thread, so let me rephrase. You said the point is to be insulting, so do you think it's fine to throw around (in 2019 fanfiction) the f-word and n-word because they are meant to be insults? To me that crosses so many more lines than calling someone a fuck or an arsehole or asshole or the other hundred insults that can be used.
