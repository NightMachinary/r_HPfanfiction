You see, the concept of races is alien to me. Like, we covered it in school under the term social Darwinism in the context of fascism with the conclusion that it had died out outside of far right circles. Which generally has been my experience in life. It isggone, and who cares about some bald idiots who shout stupid slogans. And in the past few years, I've seen it all over the place in mainstream American media and the Internet. It's just jarring because you really don't see it here, be it Germany or Poland.
