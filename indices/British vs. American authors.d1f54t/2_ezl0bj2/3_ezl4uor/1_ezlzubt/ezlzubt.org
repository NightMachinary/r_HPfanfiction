Being British myself I can say this isn't true at all. No one uses ‘faggot', we're more inclined towards ‘fuck' and ‘shit' although ‘prick' is rather common. However, language in the UK varies greatly over where you are. The culture where I'm from (south west) is completely different to the midlands, The prime example being that we actually know how to speak properly.
