Don't attribute to laziness that which is just ignorant

No I don't know what British people prefer calling this stuff. We call our yards a yard. A garden might be a subsection in the yard where you have bunch of plants/flowers or some people grow some their own stuff like my family grows tomatoes in some of our garden. I'm not sure why y'all would call a yard a garden and I didn't know that was a British term till just now. From where I'm in America people call it couch buy sometimes we may say sofa it doesn't really matter. Idk we say “going to the store” or “we are going to go shopping” I don't know it's just interchangeable. My point being is I don't write FanFiction but if I started too how would I possibly know to check for slang I didn't know existed? Obviously saying 21 for the drinking age is bad, but I feel like saying Walmart could be forgiveable. I did some quick google search and your second largest grocery store chain ASDA is owned by Walmart so technically you could say it's a Walmart :p

Tbh I just don't see why it all matters that much but maybe it's just because I'm American.
