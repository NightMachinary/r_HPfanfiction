Some are obvious (trousers v pants, pants v underwear, jumper v sweater), but I'd probably just do my own research (even aside from google, there at a bunch of relevant askreddit threads and I bet there are a bunch of similar conversations in this subreddit, too) and keep a running list of my own.

Eta: I'm in engineering so my list of things to watch out for are more about units (metric v imperial) and spelling (e.g., manoeuvre v maneuver) and organizations (Department of National Defence v Department of Defense v Ministry of Defence).
