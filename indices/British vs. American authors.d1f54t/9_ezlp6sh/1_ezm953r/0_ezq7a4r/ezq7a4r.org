-"Bollocks" on its own is like saying "fuck" or "bullshit" depending on the context

-"that's (complete/utter) bollocks" = that's bullshit

-if something is "the dog's bollocks" it's fucking excellent, generally in reference to food.

-"bollocks to /__" is like "fuck _" or "forget _/_", e.g. bollocks to brexit.

-it also means testicles.

- how comical a person sounds saying it depends completely on their accent, e.g. Hermione would sound hilarious if she tried it but it would sound natural coming from Ron. IMO northerners say it best, though unfortunately there aren't many in HP.

there are probably other uses I can't remember. in general though it's a word best used sparingly.
