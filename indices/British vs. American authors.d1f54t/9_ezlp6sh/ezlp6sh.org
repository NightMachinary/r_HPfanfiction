It bothers me a bit. I hate when fuck and shit are more common than bloody and bollucks. I don't see how hard it is for authors to keep a list of known britishisms v americanisms and just do a word search and replace before publishing. In my day job I have American, British, and Canadian clients and it's standard practice to keep a list of troublesome words and phrases to avoid/replace and to review final products to correct them before delivery.
