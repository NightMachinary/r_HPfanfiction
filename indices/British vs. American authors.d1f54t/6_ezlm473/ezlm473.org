I'm an American, so my opinion shouldn't really count, but I care more about the general tone of the dialogue than specific shit vs shite vocabulary.

In a writing group, someone asked how to say “Aw hell no” in British. The answer was “I beg your pardon,” since that phrase, delivered with the proper tone, conveys the same message as the American phrase. If some old pureblood like Walburga Black shoots down some muggle-loving idea by saying “Aw hell no” I'm out of that story.
