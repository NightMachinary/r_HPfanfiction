I'm English. Jumpers can be jumpers or sweaters and chips (as in hot potato sticks that you have as part of a meal) are chips. Not all chips are french fries.

Crisps (many flavours, come in packets) however are definitely not chips.

I don't mind some americanisms as we've picked up quite a lot anyway. For me it's things like ‘sidewalk' vs ‘pavement' or ‘pants' vs ‘trousers' that I'm more likely to pick up.

Spelling such as color vs colour I'm more likely to ignore as I read a lot of American authors so don't really pick it up anymore.
