I am sure my dialogue will be very special, so I more or less just give it my best effort. I hail from the American Deep South (Louisiana you nerds), which is very nearly as far from Britain as you can get and still be the same language. Mostly.

Anyways, while I am generally more verbose than most people here in the South I still have a lot of regional slang and place names I've picked up that nobody is going to understand. Or know how to pronounce for that matter, like Atchafalaya, Natchitoches, geaux and a variety of other little words I use without thinking.

With my current fic I'm going to have my MC spend some time in the American south so that any slang that slips through can just be written off without any trouble though.

As to reading? I don't honestly care all that much, so long as the dialogue isn't 'I hate sand' bad.
