As a reader, I'd probably shrug my shoulders and judge the fic on the rest of its merits, unless the mistakes become a big part of the plot (like the aforementioned health insurance thing).

For authors, I'd recommend focusing on other aspects of the story, but making clear in author's notes that you're happy to accept Britpicking from any readers who care enough to submit it. If someone loves your story but can't stand Americanisms, just give them a way to fix it. Problem solved!
