It would make sense for JKR, especially starting out as a poor single mother, to make a Hogwarts education accessible and socialized. A large aspect of the way Slytherin is presented in the books is using its culture to mock and satirize the old, rich boys club institutions. Notice how often those rich Slytherins are presented as ugly, cruel, and selfish compared to our good heroic Gryffindors.
