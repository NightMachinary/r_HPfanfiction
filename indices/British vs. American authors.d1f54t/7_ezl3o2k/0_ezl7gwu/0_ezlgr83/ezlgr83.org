  Or stories where a Hogwarts education is so expensive that Dumbledore convinced the Weasleys that the only way they could afford their children's tuition without incurring huge debts was by having Ron manipulate Harry into friendship, and having Ginny love potion him.

Have you seen the yearly fees for Eton? Because a year at Eton is on par with a year at Harvard in terms of cost. A year at Eton costs more than both my degrees together.

In fact, most of the UK's famous real boarding schools cost a fucking bomb.

I know JKR said that the Ministry covers all school fees but fics often ignore that because it's fairly logical that boarding school = fees. In fact, although there are state boarding schools in the UK, where the government will cover the fees you are still required to pay for the costs of boarding your kid.

It's not an ethical choice by any means, but the cost of seven kids school fees if Hogwarts were as expensive as Eton would be crippling.
