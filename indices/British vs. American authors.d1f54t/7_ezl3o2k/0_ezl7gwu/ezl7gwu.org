  I just yesterday I have read in some story that gold v. pounds arbitrage is not possible, because “we would have problems with IRS”. I mean, really?That is just pure laziness.

I have seen ones where Harry goes indy after Vernon Dursley beats him up and refuses to take him to the hospital because Harry isn't insured and the medical care is too expensive. Harry, bleeding in his bedroom, realizes that Dumbles doesn't care about him and he snaps. Or stories where a Hogwarts education is so expensive that Dumbledore convinced the Weasleys that the only way they could afford their children's tuition without incurring huge debts was by having Ron manipulate Harry into friendship, and having Ginny love potion him.

It's so ridiculous, lmao.
