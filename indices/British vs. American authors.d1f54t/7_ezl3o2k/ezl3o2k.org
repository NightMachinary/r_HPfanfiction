I have English as a second language, so I care less about “sweater” v. “jumper” issues, but there are still some things which make me pissed off. Just yesterday I have read in some story that gold v. pounds arbitrage is not possible, because “we would have problems with IRS”. I mean, really? That is just pure laziness.

Or small pet peeve ... nobody in 1990s anywhere in Europe used “Ms.” for general females, it was still always “Miss.” v “Mrs.”. Particularly, there is no way that somebody so conservative as Professor McGonagall would ever call her student “Ms. Granger”.

Other one, and that is difficult. British people truly are a way more reserved and stoic than Americans (especially those who are Mediterranean descent). I really like linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel), but the amount of hugging, crying on one's shoulder etc. is just completely American. And yes, British Harry would in my opinion tell Snape the message from his father, and perhaps with gnashing his teeth but Snape would accept it, because English man has to accept a joke.
