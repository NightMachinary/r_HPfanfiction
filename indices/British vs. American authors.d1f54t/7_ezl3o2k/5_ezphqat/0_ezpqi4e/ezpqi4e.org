Read is all on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms]]. Basically the term was renewed by feminists who claimed (rightly so) that martial status (or even worse, virginity, which was the original distinction marked by the titles) was nobody's business, especially when such difference is not used for males. Widespread use was promoted by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms._(magazine][the magazine Ms.]] which was published since 1972 in US. Of course, it took some time before the idea spread to the general usage and even more time before it got over The Pond.
