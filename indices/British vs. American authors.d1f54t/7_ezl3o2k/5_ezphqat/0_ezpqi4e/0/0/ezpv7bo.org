Yes, in my native Czechia we have “slečna/paní” dichotomy alive and doing just fine as well (it is partially caused by Czech as all Slavic languages being intensively gender oriented; way more words have gender here, even table is a male). I couldn't even imagine horror on faces of the current feminists if call a young lady “panna Nováková” (“virgin second-name”), which was common standard until well into the nineteenth century.
