Every word is 'gendered' in French, but I don't think most people think about it much or at all (people learning the language think a lot more about it because it doesn't 'sound' natural in the same way). I would be behind languages with male/female/neutral words to go towards all neutral, because it'd make memorizing those german gendered words so much easier if everything were das :P
