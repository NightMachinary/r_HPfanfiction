And we would avoid so many embarrassing misunderstandings. Whole my childhood I have battled with the finale of the Wagner's opera “Lohengrin”, where the main character, a knight Lohengrin, leaves to battle on his enchanted gigantic swan. Whole finale is completely confusing in the Czech context, where not only a swan is female, but it is generally considered the most feminine and romantic of all birds. As it stands, it makes this finale slightly smelling with homosexuality or gender ambiguity. Of course, Wagner didn't mean anything like it, and it is the most masculine and chivalric of all finales, because a swan is masculine in German (and in French too, if I am not mistaken, which is even more confusing to me; the most romantic language and it makes a swan male ... it doesn't make sense to Czechs).
