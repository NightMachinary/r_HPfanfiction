Huh, interesting. Yeah, Swan = cygne and is indeed 'le', but it's not really something I associate with gender itself. It's just the article that 'sounds right' in front of the word, and not so much anything else.

Culturally the swan is kind of seen as one of the more majestic/beautiful birds I suppose, but I don't think I don't know if I would necessarily use its inclusion as particularly male or female in a french text. There's certainly symbolism surrounding it, but... it's not anywhere near as large (IMO) as it seems to be to Czechs.
