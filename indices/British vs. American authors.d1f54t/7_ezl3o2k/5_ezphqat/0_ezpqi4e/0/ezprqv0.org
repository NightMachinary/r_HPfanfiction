Ah, I forget - people pronounce Ms(.) as 'miz', which I could see being more blatant there. I've always pronounced them the same way, which makes the whole distinction kinda not even there for me. (I'm not sure why, but to me 'miz' is less formal and written out, and I use Ms./Miss interchangeably for either unmarried women or women I don't know the marital status of. Might be the impact of having grown up in France before the US, where Mlle./Mademoiselle are the exact same)
