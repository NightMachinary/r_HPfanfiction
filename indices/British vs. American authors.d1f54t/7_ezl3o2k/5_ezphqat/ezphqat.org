  Or small pet peeve ... nobody in 1990s anywhere in Europe used “Ms.” for general females, it was still always “Miss.” v “Mrs.”. Particularly, there is no way that somebody so conservative as Professor McGonagall would ever call her student “Ms. Granger”.

Aren't Miss and Ms. the same thing - with Ms. just the abbreviation (like Mr. and Mister being the same, just abbreviated). Do people really see them that differently? At least verbally, they ought to be pronounced exactly the same. I guess Miss tends to look a /little/ better when written out for spoken language, but it doesn't really stand out to me as problematic (well, except if it's just used on its own, where I'd find it weird if not spelled out).
