I imagine it to be like my own naturally curly hair---frizzy in some spots, curly in others and a general mess. Oh how I longed to be like the girls that had effortlessly easy to manage spiral curls, but it was not for me. Instead I learned flat-iron fu and retain the services of a very talented stylist.
