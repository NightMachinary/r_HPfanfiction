I imagine her hair as ridiculously curly and unmanageable. I've read a fanfiction where her bending her head over the cauldron fumes causes it to poof out and I thought it was hilarious and probably accurate. I think as she got older she probably learned how to manage it, as most girls do, but that it remained a difficult task.
