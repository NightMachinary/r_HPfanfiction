I identified with Hermione a lot as a kid and I think this picture adequately explains why. EDIT because I hit enter too soon: I picture Hermione with hair a lot like mine - a mix of of 3A/3B curls that can and do explode into gigantic shapeless frizz the minute humidity comes anywhere near it. I also picture Hermione as being someone who doesn't know/doesn't care how to make it settle down, so she just brushes it and hopes for the best. This makes it bigger.
