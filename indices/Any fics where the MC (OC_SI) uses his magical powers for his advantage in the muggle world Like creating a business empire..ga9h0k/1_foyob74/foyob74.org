I remember a fic where the Dursleys do this - instead of trying to force Harry to be normal, they exploit it for all it's worth and encourage him to learn basically anything that they could skirt under the Statute and exploit for financial gain, especially any potions they could use.

Can't for the life of me remember what it's called though.
