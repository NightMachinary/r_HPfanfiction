In Say a Prayer, Harry and the crew do something like this. They charm trashcans to sort soda/beer cans into one of their warehouses. They then magically remove the paint and melt it down. Sell the aluminum ingots via the goblins to the muggles for good money. They also bought landfills and used alchemy to separate the trash/pollution into its base forms and resold it back to the muggles. There were also boats that dredged trash for the same reason as above.

It wasn't money with no consequences either. The oil they ended up flooding the market with caused a terrorist group to form.

TL;DR: Magical Recycling for tons of galleons?
