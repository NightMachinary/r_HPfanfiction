I just finished crossover fic Harry Potter and the Gemini Curse. (I thought it was AMAzING, 10/10 would recommend. It the triwizard tournament but with Ilvermorny and an original magic school from Australia)

One of the characters is Danny Rand and they talk about how his father has a big business in the Muggle world but they don't go into it too much.
