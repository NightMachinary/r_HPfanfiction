I've already published 3/4 of first year, with half of the Voldemort arc. Voldemort arc and invention arc overlap in second year, further development in third mostly fast forwarding, then there's the triwizard and the Greyback arc planned and the business arc won't really take off until sixth year when Fred/George graduate and start selling. I have everything planned out but at my current pace of writing it's going to take forever to get there.
