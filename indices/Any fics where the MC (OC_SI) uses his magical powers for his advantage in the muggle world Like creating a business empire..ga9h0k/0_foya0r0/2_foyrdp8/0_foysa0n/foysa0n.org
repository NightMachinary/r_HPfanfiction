How necessary is first-year to your story? If it can be skipped or fast-tracked or filled in with exposition/flashback to get to your unique and interesting ideas I'd suggest you do so. Can't tell you how many times I see a fic with interesting ideas get bogged down in 100k words on first year out of obligation.
