Yup. Copperbadge does a hell of a job with most of their stories and is one of the better fic authors I've found. The Uncle is one their finest and is hliarious. It also presents such an interesting AU take on Remus and the potential of magic in the Muggle World. Also the potential of importing muggle crime into the WW.
