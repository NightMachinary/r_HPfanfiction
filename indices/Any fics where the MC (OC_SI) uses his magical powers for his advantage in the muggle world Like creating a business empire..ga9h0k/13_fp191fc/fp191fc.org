Why even bother? Just buy one of those magical trunks, Apparate into Fort Knox, steal all the gold, and take it to Gringotts. Or go on a bank-robbing spree using the same method. Always liked that Ancient Egyptian piece from the British Museum? Well, take it. It's not that hard. Apparition, Disillusionment, Confundus, Obliviate and the Imperius is all it takes to completely hoard all the wealth you can nab from the Muggle world.

In the canon world, the WW are completely cut off from all reality when it comes to Muggles. The supposed Muggle expert of the British ministry can't even pronounce electricity. As the Goblins say in so many cliche-riddled fanfics, /wizards are idiots./ Canon Potterverse is the most easily exploitable world in literature for any self-insert with half a brain.

Now, if you go into fanon... Well, you have to really watch your steps. The ICW most likely has wards over strategic, Muggle sites. They probably have a whole division scouring every website, news outlet, and tv station for any weird news that sounds like it's caused by magic. There is a magical signature which can be traced to you. There are probably all sort of talismans that would protect other wizards from the Imperius, and wouldn't surprise me if high-end muggle politicians are given such things too. It would be hard to exploit a lot of the fanon Potterverses. Not saying impossible, it could definitely be done. But much, much harder.
