The best flawed-but-good Hermione fic is, in my opinion, the sadly abandoned [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/][Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation]] by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1994264/][Vera Rozalsky]]. Any flaw you can think of from trying to do everything alone to steam-rolling others to thinking she knows best, it is in this fic and is lovingly and gently deconstructed. It's very clear that the writer loves Hermione's character warts and all.

Other assorted flawed!Hermione fics:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25272307][There's a List for That]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/GatherYourStrength/pseuds/GatherYourStrength][GatherYourStrength]] - she had to be stunned in order to get her to rest. Almost worked herself to death. (Note: some chapters are in other people's POV, but it is decidedly Hermione-centric)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7559806/1/][Cry Out, Curlew]] by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1693442/][Evil Is A Relative Term]] - worked herself to collapse (Warning: abandoned; there are also chapters not in Hermione's POV but most are)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6766210][Will you?]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/SinBin/pseuds/SinBin][SinBin]] - thought she was right and tried to handle stuff on her own. Now, she is running from the Skrewts.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/474762][More Than Kisses]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Rozarka/pseuds/Rozarka][Rozarka]] - tendency for self-isolation bites in her the butt and almost wrecks her relationship (Note: only half of this is in Hermione's POV)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21187844][Hermione Granger & the Goblet of Fire]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Coulsdon_Eagle/pseuds/Coulsdon_Eagle][Coulsdon_Eagle]] - She ends up as Triwizard Champion because of a spell she secretly put on Harry. The entire story is the consequence.
