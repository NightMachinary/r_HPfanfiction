I read the whole thing. It has some scenes I liked. One particular quote beginning with "When this flawed world seems unusually hateful..." Resonated with me quite a bit. And I'm in support of transhumanism in general.

On the other hand, no female character has agency, and yudkowski either can't or won't understand what people mean when they explain this is a problem with his story. Hermione gets fridged late in the game so harry can be sad about her death, and he missed the point when people complained about that, too.

Really, no character other than harry and quirellmort have any real agency. Quirellmort at one point holds an entire defense class just to teach harry how to lose. The other students do not complain about this or act like it's odd in any way. It's almost like the entire world revolves around harry in this fic, almost like he's a Mary Sue or something. Oh wait, that's exactly what he is, and the author even more or less admitted it, so that's something I guess... Except he even misses the point of why a Mary Sue is problematic.

Oh, and apparently a lot of his science is wrong anyway, so you don't even learn correct rationality from his author tract.

Worth skimming through if you like transhumanist stuff. Worth reading if you like nerdy rants. Otherwise, don't bother with it.
