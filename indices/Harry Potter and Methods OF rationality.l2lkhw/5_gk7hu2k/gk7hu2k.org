Definitely agreed on the un-likeability of the main character. I can't even call him Harry, because he is a complete self-insert who is Harry in name only.

Giving their character a triple-barrel surname is a HUGE red flag for a writer being a pretentious idiot. As far as I can tell, it seems to be aimed at teenagers who haven't yet realised that being book-smart is not the same as being intelligent.

Somebody on a previous thread put it better than I can: the character (and by extension, the writer) is the guy nobody wants to be stuck talking to at a party.
