Exactly this. I heard the summary of the fic, and I was like "heck yea!" Thought it sounded super fun and a completely logical AU of the HP universe. Then I actually started reading it. UGH!

I can't finish any story if I am rooting against the protagonist. The only way I could have finished MoR is if someone told me that it ends with Harry being drawn and quartered by a mob of pissed off wizards tired of his smug condescension haha :D
