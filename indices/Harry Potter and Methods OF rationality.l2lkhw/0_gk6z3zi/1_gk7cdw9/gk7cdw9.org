Ramsey Bolton is fun to hate because he's a psychotic antagonist, and we live in hope that one day he'll get his comeuppance. MOR!Harry is hateable in an un-fun way because he's absolutely unbearable to listen to, whilst also being the protagonist with the story validating all of his views and actions.
