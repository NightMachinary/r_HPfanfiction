But what about Voldemort in HPMOR, OP? He's the most calculated and entertaining of any fic because he isn't a brain dead caracature. Name one other fic with a smart Voldemort. They don't exist.

What I don't get is the focus on Harry being OOC (which there is a good in universe explanation for). Meanwhile, Hermione and Draco are 35 yr olds in 11 yr old bodies the way they are written. I love HPMOR, but those 2 characters are laughably unbelievable.
