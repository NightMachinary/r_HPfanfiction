To be fair, the same is frequently said of canon Harry too. Any character can be disliked if you don't see anything of yourself in them, or a person you admire.

I see a lot of myself in canon Harry but plenty people out there swear that he's unrealistic and unbelievable because in their minds, no-one would act like he does or make the decisions he does.
