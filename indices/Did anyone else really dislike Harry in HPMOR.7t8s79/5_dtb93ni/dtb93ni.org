People of this sub need to remember that although it's technically HP fanfiction, it's so entirely different from the rest of the fandom. I don't know of any fic that changes everything as dramatically as HPMOR. It also has such a different tone.

Normal fics are JK Rowling with some amount of difference. Thing is, they all accept the existence of a soul, death, and whatnot.

HPMOR just doesn't. Everything is different. I wouldn't really call it HP fanfiction, even though it technically is. It's just not like other fanfiction.

So, I usually just want people to go into it with their minds open, and be aware that they might not like it. It's definitely a highly flawed work, but it's an enjoyable one.

It's so much like an original work, that I don't think there are any other HP fanfics with as much fanfanfics written after them as HPMOR.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
