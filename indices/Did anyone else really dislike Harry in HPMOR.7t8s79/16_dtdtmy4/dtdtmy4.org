I for one was drawn to the story solely by the writing and the occasional dry humor. I just pretended that the fic spanned the entire seven years at Hogwarts and blatantly ignored anything stating otherwise.

When I read it, the last chapter was the one with the troll. I don't know if I forget about it or just have a giant hole in my memory but the next time that I looked at it, it was complete and I definitely realized that changes had been made when I re-read the complete work.
