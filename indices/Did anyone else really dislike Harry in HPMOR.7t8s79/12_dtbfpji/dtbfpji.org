I was like that myself as a kid. Not freakishly as smart as much as I thought I was freakishly smart, but still smart enough to be a smart-ass to the people around me and annoying the fuck out of them by doing so. Hard to hate another kid that acts the same way you know?

  You'd think having kind loving adoptive parents would make him even more like Lily but it seems to have had the opposite effect.

If your parents put massive value on you being smart, you're gonna act like that. As a kid, my dad kept telling me how much smarter I was than all the kids my age, and the teachers of my primary school for that matter. I basically acted like I was just to try and please him. harry's parents in this fic seem to be pretty much exactly like that too, so it makes sense to me.
