It really surprised me to see the top rated fics. Usually I just check out the latest fics over 60k words and Harry as the main character, but a few days ago I decided to sort by favourites.

Out of the top 50 or so favourited stories there are perhaps one or two where everybody acts in character and there is no bashing.

I had no idea that the most popular fanfiction would be fanfiction that is completely different from the books. In many cases the characters are so different that they would be barely recognizable if we weren't told their names. It's not what I expected at all. I thought a lot of people were like me and read Harry Potter fanfiction because they like the story and the characters and want to spend more time with them, not that they wanted completely different characters.
