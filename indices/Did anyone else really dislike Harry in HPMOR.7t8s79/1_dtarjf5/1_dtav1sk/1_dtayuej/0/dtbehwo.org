Of course you change some things, otherwise it's just plagiarism. You're just comparing it to the other extreme; changing nothing at all. Then you might as well just read the books.

I just mean I don't really understand why people read fanfiction in which the characters are basically different people. Often they aren't even recognisable as the characters from the books, so why even call it fanfiction? Then why not create completely new characters?
