Eh, you gotta keep in mind that people come to fanfiction for different things. Some people come for their love of certain characters, and wanting to see faithful recreations of those characters in new situations.

Some, like myself, never really liked or cared about the canon characters, and instead only care about the world. So OOCness doesn't bother me unless it's unexplained, or so completely opposite to the original characterization that it's hard to suspend disbelief.
