I only read the first thirty or so chapters back when it was being written. Then the author's asshat ways (paraphrasing, "Pay me money for my fanfiction since it is is vastly superior to canon Harry Potter"), coupled with my own apathy toward the subject convinced me to drop the story. (That he was a dick in response to a polite review I left didn't help keep my interest.)

I've always felt the characterization of Harry was such because he was essentially an author self-insert, much like Hermione in the original series.
