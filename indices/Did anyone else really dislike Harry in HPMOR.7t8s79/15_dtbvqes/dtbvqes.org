Same I don't know I just felt like he came of more pretentious than he was supposed too. Like there were points where he was explaining things like theories in say physics or psychology and it was supposed to make it seeem like he was well read and intelligent. But sometimes it just felt kinda unnecessary and boring especially closer to the begining when he wasn't always using the theories as application but just to explain the situation. It was kinda like just annoucing look I know stuff.
