Yes, the majority of this sub I would say. It didn't bother me because the story's a parody and none of the characters are really the characters, they're just plot devices to launch shade and criticisms at canon. I enjoyed it anyway because of the cleverness and genre-twisting/gameplaying nature of it, Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy vibe, but it's definitely not a style to everyone's taste.
