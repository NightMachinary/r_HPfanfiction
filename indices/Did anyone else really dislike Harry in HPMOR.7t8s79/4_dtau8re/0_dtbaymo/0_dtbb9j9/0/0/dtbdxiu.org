/Something/ like that. The difference is that he was an /intentional/ Horcrux. The wording of the Prophecy was slightly different in that AU (the final lines were "Either must destroy all but a remnant of the other; For those two different spirits cannot exist in the same world"), and Voldemort, when he heard that Prophecy, decided to try and fulfill the Prophecy on his own terms by using that AU's version of the Horcrux Ritual (which also works differently) to /make/ Harry's spirit more similar to his own.

The key point of this Voldemort is that he's a genius, an unparalleled mastermind who is, at his core, excruciatingly /bored/ with the world. Dumbledore is a slightly better opponent than the norm and that's why, purely for entertainment value, he'd drawn out the first war over so many years when he could have easily taken over Britain in a year or two if he'd /really/ gone all-out. With Harry, he hoped to kill two birds with one stone by simultaneously fulfilling the Prophecy /and/ giving himself an actual smart person to talk to.

That Harry was literally born to be Voldemort's idea of good company.

Only, Voldemort hadn't anticipated Harry would keep the conscience that /he/ never had.
