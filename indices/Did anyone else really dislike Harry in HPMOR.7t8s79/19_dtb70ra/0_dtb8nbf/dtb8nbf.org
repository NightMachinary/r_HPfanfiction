People complain about characterization because of insecurity? That's a new one on me. Especially considering that complaining about Harry (and Ron and Hermione and Dumbledore and Snape and you name it) being OOC is a major pastime of fic forums and not unique to HPMOR at all. Or HP fandom itself, for that matter.
