I have heard the Mrs. Norris maledictus theory and I see the merit in it. I could definitely see that playing a role, and I think that describes the connection he has with her as well as the sadness he seems to express in Chamber of Secrets when she is petrified, but I'm not sure if I agree with that being the reason he hates students. I think that is that were the case, he would be more focused on protecting her than torturing the students. It is a really interesting thery though !
