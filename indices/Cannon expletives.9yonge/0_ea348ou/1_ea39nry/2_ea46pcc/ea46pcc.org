Have to disagree considering when the statue actually become a thing. By the late 1600 Christianity had been the default religion of western Europe for nearly 1000 years.

Additionally witch burns and punishment for witchcraft really aren't as common as fan's like to pretend and was more a local mob/protestant thing.

Also what translation of the bible are you reading. Without context in ancient Greek or Hebrew does it really read like we think in english, are thowe original passages or where they added later?
