They were not uncommon, but they started way later than people think. There's an imperial decree from ~1000 which states that any and all witchcraft charges are bullshit.

Checked in both the common English and the German ones. The old testament is pretty clear (it refers to Potion use IIRC, which is obviously taught at Hogwarts) and the new one has a few passages as well (acts, revelations), referring to everything from magical scrolls to curses.
