The wizarding world only separated from the muggle world in the 17th century.

Swearing by god was common (God's blood, god's wounds, god's flesh etc etc).

I doubt wizards around the time of the statute of secrecy actually went into church or really knew who god was other than by cultural osmosis. But linguistic mirroring is a thing. If you spend time around other people, you will subconsciously pick up on and start using their vocabulary. And children learn from watching their parents, they may have no fucking clue what god is or why their parents are swearing by him but it sounds like a swearword so they'll use it.
