"Circe!" is fanon, that's never said in the books. "Merlin!" is, in a way, also fanon. I'm not saying that the characters don't invoke Merlin's name as an exclamation, but it's got to be /part/ of an expression --- Merlin's beard, Merlin's pants, Merlin's saggy left bollock, what in the name of Merlin, how in the name of Merlin.

In the books, the characters never say "Merlin!" on its own. Be aware, in the books, the characters also say oh my god, god!, good lord, thank god, etc. (even the Malfoys and the Weasleys).

Because it's a children's book, we never hear the characters swear (other than "bloody"). But I'm more than willing to bet, when JKR wrote "Ron swore" or "Harry swore under his breath," she more than likely imagined them saying "fuck," "shit," "bloody hell," "twats," "fucking hell," "shithead," "for fuck's sake," "piss off," "bollocks," "fucking bastard," "useless bastard," "fucking toe rag," etc. etc. etc. rather than invoking any sort of Greek goddess.
