linkffn(Browncoat Green Eyes by nonjon) is a good fic in that regard.

Harry puts himself in a magical sleep and isn't woken until later, on a different planet. And there is no sign of the wizarding world.

The worldbuilding of this fic is absolutely great, the rest is above average at least.\\
If you usually like stuff by nonjon, this fic is for you.

(You don't need to have watched Firefly or the movie Serenity to follow the plot)
