That would actually be a cool prompt for Pottermum.

Something along the lines of Harry, on his 18th birthday is somehow tossed 18 years into the future and has to deal with his disappearance and how it affected everyone. Ginny could have spent the time since he disappeared casually dating but focused more on her career than on deep romantic relationships given that she and Harry were very much together when he disappeared and she never got over her tragic love.

18 year old Harry trying to regain some of what he had with now 35 year old Ginny could be a fascinating and all together sappy and fluffy piece, possibly dealing with witches and wizards retaining their youth longer than with their muggle counterparts or the fact that they'd both technically be at their respective sexual peaks in this scenario. I actually like this the more I think about it, though I am no writer myself.
