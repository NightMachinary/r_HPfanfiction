I could see a premise.

Lucious fumbles the plant of the Diary on Ginny and has Draco do it the next year. He plants it on Hermione instead. Harry gets pulled back in time randomly throughout the year and they eventually figure out it happened whenever Hermione used the time turner while holding the horcrux. They discover that souls are time linked.

Harry does some digging on his own. You can only go back in time an hour but he doesn't see any restrictions on going forward. Later on he decides to fall on his own sword by tossing himself to the future and taking Voldemort with him.
