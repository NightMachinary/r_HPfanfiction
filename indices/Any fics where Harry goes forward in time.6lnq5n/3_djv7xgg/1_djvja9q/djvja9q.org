Just want to second Next Lord of Kobol. I'm currently following, and it's a great read.

You don't really need any knowledge of Battlestar Galactica to follow, as only the last couple of chapters have even included anyone recognizable from the series.

Great bit of world building, and so far a really fun ride.
