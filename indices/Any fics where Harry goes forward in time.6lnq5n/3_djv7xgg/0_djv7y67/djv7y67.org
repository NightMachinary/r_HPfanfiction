  Heavily AU. Thanks to a cold, humanity never discovers the Prothean ruins on Mars, and barely develops Mass Effect technology. They step out onto the galactic stage after the Reapers have harvested every other species, and find the crumbs left behind by the turians, asari, and salarians. Now they must adapt to fight a foe who won't be seen for far longer than human history.

  Carried to the far end of the Galaxy by the veil in the Department of Mysteries, Harry Potter becomes a veritable stranger in a strange land. But all the obstacles he has faced pale in comparison to the Cylon menace. Starts in the middle of Harry's fifth year and roughly eleven years before the fall of the Twelve Colonies.
