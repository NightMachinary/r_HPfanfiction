  Harry Potter may not be The Boy Who Lived, but the world isn't going to save itself, and it sure as hell could use all the help it needs, especially if Voldemort gets his hands on an ancient weapon from the Department of Mysteries that would guarantee his victory if he is allowed to return. Only this time, Harry may need help of his own - from some rather unorthodox allies.
