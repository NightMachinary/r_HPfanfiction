Not the first one :( - don't invent new siblings for existing characters, this almost never works! If you have to have an OC, make them a total OC and give them a new family etc. :) - especially when you can't really explain well why a certain sibling only shows up now!

Also, the name! Damned, be creative :(

Second one isn't bad, but don't make it Hermione (it doesn't fit her profile at all to be an auror...even the chest-monster (Ginny Weasley!) would work better here!)...Tonks might work (and she'd be a pain in the ass if you have to secure meetings against a metamorphmagus who could literally be ANYBODY!)

Also, why would Harry not get a Hogwarts letter in your second idea? Has he been tried in absentia with a "snap wand on sight" order in place? Hell, they'd have to have proof (he's a hero in the publics eye, being suspected of a crime isn't enough to just order his wand snapped on sight and not sending him a Hogwarts letter...also: Running a criminal empire from school sounds interesting, too! Especially when he can bring in stuff a lot of students would want: Contraceptive potions, aphrodisiacs, the potion-equivalent of viagra, certain drugs etc.)

Third idea...nah, not interested...time-travel fictions aren't my thing (unless it's something like "Harry (or sb. else!) travels back to first/second/third etc. year (or maybe even to the time before they were at Hogwarts!)" (re-do fictions basically!)) especially if they kind of time-travel while making it massively AU (like sending Harry back to stop Tom Riddle...nah, sorry! Not my cup of tea!)
