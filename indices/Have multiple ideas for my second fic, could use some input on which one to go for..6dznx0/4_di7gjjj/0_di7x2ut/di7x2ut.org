Thanks for the feedback. Caine was more or less a placeholder for now, I had planned on coming up with something original later down the line. And the idea about Harry going to Hogwarts and starting a criminal enterprise from there actually sounds pretty cool, so I'd take that idea on board.

The third one doesn't have any time travel, it's just an alternate history period setting, but I see what you're getting at.
