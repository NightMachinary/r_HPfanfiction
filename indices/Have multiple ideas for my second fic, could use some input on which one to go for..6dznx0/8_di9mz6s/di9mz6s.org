All three have promise. Personally, I like /Rebel, Rebel/ the best (and not just because of the title), but I that one would be a lot of work.

/The Only Living Boy in New York/ is interesting because sibling OCs usually aren't so ominous-sounding, and fuck yeah, Court of Owls.

/Walkin' After Midnight/, however, would have broader appeal than both of those, and you had me at Guy Ritchie. I'd like it especially if Hermione was a bit arrogant and standoffish, Ã  la Cumberbatch's Sherlock. Without Harry at Hogwarts, it's likely that her time there would have ended up a little different.
