You're already going AU, may as well make it massive. Have the muggle world be steam or dieselpunk. Use sky captain as the visual cues for rebel, rebel. No hogwarts doesn't mean no magical society. It might even mean no pureblood prejudice due to no slytherin propaganda or centralization of bigotry. Perhaps the magicborn's prejudice is more overtly cultural/classist. Without a central school though, magic would have a master/apprentice system most likely.
