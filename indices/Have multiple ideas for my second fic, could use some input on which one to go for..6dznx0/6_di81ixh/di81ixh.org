Whichever interests your personally the most. Which one would you like to read?

With your permission I'll provide few thoughts:

First one sounds tad cliche - lost/abandoned siblings just don't make much sense. Wizards are already stupidly powerful and both Voldemort and Dumbledore are far from stupid so there being yet another secret super-powerful organisation is dubious at best.

Crime lord Harry would be interesting, but you need to let him realistic childhood and his ascent to crime lord status. And Hermione somehow doesn't work for me as an Auror.

Last idea could be very interesting, but also would require the most work to make it believable.
