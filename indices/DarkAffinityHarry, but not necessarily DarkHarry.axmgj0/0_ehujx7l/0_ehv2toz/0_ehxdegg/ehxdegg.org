Honestly I don't think it would work well as a full fic.

A 13 year old more or less /creating/ organized crime and becoming the richest and most influential person in magical Britain?

I think a fic that ran with the general idea would be good, but that it would need to be stretched out until Harry is a full adult, and we need to see the presence of an already existing criminal element. It should be a take over, not a new development.
