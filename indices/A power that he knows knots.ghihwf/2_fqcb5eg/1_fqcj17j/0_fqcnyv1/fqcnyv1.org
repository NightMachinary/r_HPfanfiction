Probably not a bowline, but that brings up the idea of using knots that have evocative names, such as a sheepshank, a sheet bend, or a terminal Turk's head.

Over at [[https://www.animatedknots.com/complete-knot-list][this site]], you can find knots with names such as the blood knot, the monkey's fist, the slim beauty, the strangle knot, and the whoopie sling.
