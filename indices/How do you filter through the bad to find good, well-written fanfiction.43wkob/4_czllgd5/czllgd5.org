Well, I don't think there's a foolproof method, but mine is to filter by length and my preferred characters, and then skim the summaries. If it's poorly written, makes no sense, is basically just stating a clich√©d trope of that fandom, or is nonexistent, then it's a pass. Then, since it is possible to write fantastic summaries and not so fantastic stories, I read the first two chapters (or just one if it's insanely long). If it hasn't impressed me by then, I move on.

I also rely heavily on recommendations from people who have proved to have similar tastes to mine, though, and institute the two-chapter rule with those as well. Neither way is perfect, but I'm happy with the number of fics I turn up, and I don't usually end up reading much crap.
