I use favorites list of authors I like (or bookmarks on AO3), go through AO3 tags (filtering by completed works), and look through Communities on fanfiction.net. Sometimes if I want to read something specific, I search for Completed fics over 20K words, English, and sort by Favorites, Kudos, or Reviews.

But mostly I look at the favorites list of good authors.
