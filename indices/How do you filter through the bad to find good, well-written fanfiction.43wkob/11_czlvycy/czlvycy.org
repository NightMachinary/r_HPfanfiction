I look through the favorites list of authors I like and the favorites of people who leave reviews on stories I particularly enjoy. I sort by length (I tend not to read anything under at least 40,000 words) and then pick things based on well written summaries. Sometimes I'll search a keyword or a pairing I'm in the mood for, and I'll "spot check" which means picking a random chapter or two and skimming a paragraph to make sure it's reasonably well written.
