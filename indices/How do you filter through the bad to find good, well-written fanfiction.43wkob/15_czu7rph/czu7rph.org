I narrow the parameters as tightly as possible. Most "Romance" stories are tossed out immediately. Then I decide to pick the characters I want to read about. For example, Luna Lovegood and Ginny Weasley. Their years before the DA are filled with possibilities--a really good one that was recently taken down was /Faith and Understanding./

Or you go into the search bar and look for a simple phrase--Battle of Hogwarts, Quibbler, Order, DA, and then narrow the characters that way.

You still have to filter out the bad, but this is much easier than searching through 700,000 stories.
