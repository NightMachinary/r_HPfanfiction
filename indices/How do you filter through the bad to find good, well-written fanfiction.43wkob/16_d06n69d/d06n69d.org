One thing I frequently do is read the first page of reviews. If there are a lot of grammatical issues or totally unexplained plot pieces, a lot of times people will leave a constructive (or flame) point which also alerts me to the quality. I've also found other stories I like through reading reviews when someone compares it favorably with another one they've read.
