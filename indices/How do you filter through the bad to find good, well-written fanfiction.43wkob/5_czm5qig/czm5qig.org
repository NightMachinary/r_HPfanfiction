Well, this subreddit is pretty good for it, although I found all of my favourites through the TvTropes page which while great, it is very much outdated and not so easy to navigat.Not to mention that none of the comments are neutral, they're just people's opinions on the story which may or may not alin with your own.

So this subreddit's pretty cool. Nothing people will recomend to you here it' "crap", it just may not be to your liking.
