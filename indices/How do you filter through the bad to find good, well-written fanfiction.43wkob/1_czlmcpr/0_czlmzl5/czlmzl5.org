Although too many tags in AO3 is annoying, I love the fact I can search by them. Things like 'muggle magic war', or 'time travel' or 'smart harry' are very helpful in finding something I want to read. I also love AO3 for letting me load the whole thing at once. There is also some awesome illustrated stories on AO3.
