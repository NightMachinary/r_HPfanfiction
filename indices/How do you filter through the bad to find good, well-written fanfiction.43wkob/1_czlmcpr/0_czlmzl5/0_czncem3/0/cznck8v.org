The character lists and pairing is so much cleaner in AO3. FFN did (kind of) make a way to find gen fics, by making a box for 'pairing' as opposed to just the character list. But authors didn't go back and change their fics, new stories are rarely marked right, and as the list is limited to 4 characters, it doesn't always work if they are marked right.
