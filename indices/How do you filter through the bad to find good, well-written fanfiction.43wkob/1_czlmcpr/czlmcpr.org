I'll read recommendations or favourites of authors I like. If something on this subreddit catches my eye I'll read it as well.

In terms of searching, I tend to change the settings to English, Any Rating and then 40K. If there's any genre/character/world I feel like reading I'll set that too, but sometimes I'll add that too. Sometimes I use the search function and type in a few keywords if there's a certain trope I'm looking for, and then narrow it down by category / word count / language.

I usually aim for over 20K or over 40K for the word count, just because I find a lot of authors start strong but then lose interest after a couple of chapters. I also mentally divide the word count by the chapter numbers to see if the chapters are a decent length or if they're too short. I'd rather too long than too short because I find authors with very short chapters tend to not be very good. There's exceptions to this obviously, but as a general rule I find they're plotless and just turning out crap to get a chapter out. 2K to 6K per chapter is the sweet point for me, although sometimes I'll bend.

I judge by the summaries. If the wording is awkward or there's SPAG I'll skip because that just tells me the rest of the story will be just the same.

It's a lot of trial and error. I haven't figured out AO3 yet since I hate the walls of tagging that crop up.
