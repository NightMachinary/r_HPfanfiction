I'll give FFN a search every few months. I set the filters to >5k, Complete, Rating: M (or all, depending on my mood), English, and Harry P. as the main character. Since search for pairingless fics is a huge pain in the ass, I'll rotate the second character filter for my usual pairings (Fleur, Tonks, Luna, Daphne, Gabrielle, Tracey, OC) and then chop it down from there.

Sometimes I'll look for WIPs, but usually just read the first chapter or two and then bookmark it and not read it until it's completed. I don't like having to reread the same few chapters to a story over and over whenever a new chapter is posted, or the huge disappointment when a good story is abandoned.

Most times I don't find anything new to read and reread my favorites instead.
