There's some good advice here already, I'd definitely take it. Personally, I can usually tell if a fic is going to suck just by reading the title or summary. There's just a "feel" you're looking for, you know? Collect some 'red flags' and use them liberally. It'll make sorting through long archives go faster. My red flags look something like:

- A summary asks a question that has an obvious answer
- The story name is a title of a bad rock song that was briefly popular back in like 2004
- The summary has errors
- Someone calls Hermione "'Mione"
- WIPs
- AUs that take place outside of the wizarding world
- Completely unbelievable premises, like Harry going into hiding in the muggle world by becoming a celebrity footballer
- If the archive has tags like AO3, really weird tag combos that you can't even begin to reconcile. Like /"Snape POV, HBP compliant, pre DH, Comedy, Romance, Humor"/.
- Any character smoking a cigarette or wearing a leather jacket
- Snape listening to some fucking ridiculous, obviously-projected 'favorite band' of the author's like Death Cab For Cutie or Counting Crows or whatever.

I mean, I could go on all night. But you tend to get a feel for when something is going to be just absolutely terrible and not worth your time.
