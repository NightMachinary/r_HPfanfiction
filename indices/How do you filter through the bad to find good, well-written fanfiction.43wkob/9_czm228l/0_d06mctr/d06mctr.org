Lol too funny. I was rolling with the "bad rock song that was briefly popular back in like 2004". I personally though don't have a problem with "'Mione" but I do cringe at "Hermy". Also, I don't feel it would be entirely OOC for Snape to smoke, or possibly any other character whose origins we might not be well known (say Dean Thomas).
