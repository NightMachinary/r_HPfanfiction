I don't have a problem with 'Mione, but usually it's all Harry/Ron/Ginny ever call her, and it gets annoying real fast. It's one of those invasive fanons. And it makes me wary because, what other annoying fanons have invaded the fic? I don't stick around to find out. And I don't necessarily have an issue with a character like Snape smoking (I can recall one great fic where he does), but it's one of those things where... if the author feels it necessary to put it in there, they might not be writing the kind of story I'm interested in. You know, turning Snape or Draco into more muggily-idenitifable 'bad boys', that kind of thing. Not my jam.
