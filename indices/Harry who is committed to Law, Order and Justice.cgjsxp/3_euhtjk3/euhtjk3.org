Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

After the war, Harry and Ron join the aurors but are disappointed that they can't go after the rich purebloods like Malfoy because they effectively control the Ministry.

Meanwhile Hermione and Sirius try to politically dismantle the status quo and secretly reduce the wealth of the bribing families by robbing them.

Obviously Harry isn't happy about thieves going around but eventually he agrees that it's the only way the power monopoly of the rich old families can be broken.
