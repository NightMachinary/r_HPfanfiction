I wrote most of this post two years ago, but I'll repost it here because it's very topical. I've added a few items, and randomly trimmed down the list so that it doesn't go over the bot's 30 fic limit, but for the most part, if I've mentioned their username, you should check their profile, because they've definitely written more hp/tmr or hp/lv or hp&tmr; there's just no space for it here. Since I've trimmed the number of recs to at most 1-2 random ones (from the list I had before) per writer, if you don't like the fic linked, I'd still encourage you to take a look at their profile for more.

These are in no particular order, although most of the ones actually linked are longer/plot-based stories, mostly because I also know a lot of one shots but don't want to go through absolutely everything. If you're looking more for drabbles/fluff and coffee shops/one-shots/whatever, let me know.

Edit: also, it's not on the list because the list was mostly for actual ship fics, but Prince of the Dark Kingdom is a great mentorship fic, although very well-known so you may have read it already.
