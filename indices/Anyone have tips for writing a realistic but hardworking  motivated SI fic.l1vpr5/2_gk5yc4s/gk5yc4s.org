Well actually, you might want to use that last bit. Not in the sense that they go around stating all this shit. But realistically if you want to make them like Flitwick at a young age, you need creativity. They should be doing things they learn at their age but creatively and at a higher level.

Change Matchsticks to Needles.

The needles would have patterns and they could experiment with the size and shape of the needles. The needle used for hair is different from a knitting needle. Different kinds of materials for the needles etc. Silver or plastic?

Show them experimenting and practicing. Have scenes where they can /use/ this or show it off. But do it without shoving in our faces how amazing they are.

Make it seem like they have to struggle for everything but don't make it a drag.

If you want a beta reader for your fic...depending on how the characters are written and ship....

I could do it. Not in the grammar sense but in the /writing/ aspect.

But I'm not going to read something I don't enjoy so please pm a synopsis and anything I know if you want my help.
