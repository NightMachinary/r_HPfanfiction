It doesn't matter how good at magic the main character is, what matters is how it's shown. How 'realistic' it is for an OC to be talented is less important than how that talent is showcased in the fic. Learning magical theory, using magic in interesting ways, etc, are much more interesting to read than simply stating how talented they are through grades, etc.
