One of the main points I've picked up is that practice, knowledge and desire are the triad needed to have power over a spell and eventually over magic in general.

All of the DA become 'exceptional', through sheer practice and need.

Harry isn't a huge scholar, he just uses a few spells very well and picks them up quickly, by trying again and again and again until it sticks.

Non-verbal magic also seems to be about sheer practice.

So, for your SI, magic /should/ be complicated (adults have trouble going over their kids' maths homework because they've forgotten it, and have no idea what a 'fronted adverbial' is and why would they, and don't 'get' computer programming when dedicated kids manage a good start). However, an adult has different priorities to a child and might well be able to buckle down for a long term goal. An adult that has studied /as/ an adult has a leg up.
