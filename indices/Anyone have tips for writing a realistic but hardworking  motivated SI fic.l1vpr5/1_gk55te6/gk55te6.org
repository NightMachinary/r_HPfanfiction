  magical Gringotts that solves every issue even though they're only a bank, super powered Room of Requirement (sidenote: why the heck would there be a ton of magical money and gems there? Lots of people have been there and have probably thought about making a quick buck), misogyny in every conversation with literally any female, being outright antagonistic towards anyone that slightly opposes you.

I enjoy SI fanfics for pretty much any fandom. But hotdamn if you didn't hit the nail it on the head. A lot of HP SIs sure act the same.

  committing crimes/finding loopholes with ease because the SI is just sooo smart and every other wizard is dumb because a 12 year old said they lack common sense, and the armchair philosophy about how the levitation charm can kill you just as easily as the Killing Curse

Especially this.

I'd add "i'll master occlumency on my own asap" as something overdone. Weasley twins being lectured on immaturity is something I see fairly often (even when the SI is years younger). The SI lecturing canon characters in general with no pushback is pretty dumb imo.

Good luck with your fic.
