I read it a month ago so I don't really know all the details anymore but I really enjoyed it. I'm a fan of these kind of fics, romance, a good story and also just normal day stuff. While it didn't become my new fav fic it became a solid 8/10 fic for me which I enjoyed reading and I will read it again sometime.
