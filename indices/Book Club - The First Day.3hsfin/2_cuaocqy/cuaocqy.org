It has been ages since I last read /The First Day/. Back then I loved it, especially since it gave me more Harry Potter after Deathly Hallows ended.

Now, while rereading, I can't help but feel a little jaded. I am one of the many who didn't really liked Rowling's epilogue, but I liked /The First Day/, not because it was action packed or anything, but just because it gave me another shot of HP.

Let me just say, the writing was really great, but (when reading it now) there is always in the back of my mind the absurdity of Rowling's names and pairings.

*TL;DR:* Characterwise it totally holds up, canonwise I didn't buy it anymore.
