I liked this fic. Its a change of pace from what I usually read. I think sometimes life after a giant adventure is harder for a hero to cope with. I saw what happens to Harry in this happen to a few blokes I know that we're in the gulf wars. Normal life takes time to adjust to after you've seen a lot of trauma. I love how ron and Harry both thought things were going to be peachy after the war but they aren't. Great fic
