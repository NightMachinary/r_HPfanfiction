Finally got around to finishing The First Day, I really liked it. I enjoy slice of life stories, and this one was really emotionally moving at some points. I didn't like the few time jumps (minorly distracting), but I did like how it focuses on each and every one of them.

The one thing that /really/ bothered me was Katie's choice bear the end. I wish there had been some kind of resolution or closure to that part, but eh. That would've put it over a year.
