Little0bird is one of my favorite authors, and a major contributor to my headcanons.

While the first few chapters are a hard slog, I read a lot of fics where the author tries to rush the characters through grieving in order to get to the plot, or manufactures some sort of external conflict to keep the plot interesting. Little0bird allows the characters to sulk and brood, which isn't always the most exciting thing to read.

There is conflict and anger, but it doesn't feel forced into the plot in order to keep the reader interested. She gives them time to grieve.

I also like how she doesn't portray the recovery process (and other internal character conflicts) as a straight line. I think that's one of the things that makes her writing feel very realistic. The characters have setbacks and bad days. I feel like Ginny/Harry were age-appropriate, they made mistakes and were still figuring things out. I honestly could have done without the whole angsting over their physical relationship, but maybe that's just me.

One thing that's great about The First Day and other fics of hers with a similar structure (More Than Words, Questions and Answers, etc.) is that the ensemble cast allows her to sort of check in with the characters as needed. It's like their lives are 85% dull banality and 15% conflict/drama/problems, and she shows us 25% of their lives.
