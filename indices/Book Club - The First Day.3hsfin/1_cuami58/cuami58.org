The First Day is very good but it also exemplifies the main problem fics that adhere to the book ending and comply with the epilogue tend to have: not a lot happens. It is very very good though, it manages to deal with multiple characters, both main and secondary without a problem and makes them interesting in their own way without overshadowing each other.
