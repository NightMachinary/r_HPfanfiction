  The First Day is very good but it also exemplifies the main problem fics that adhere to the book ending and comply with the epilogue tend to have: not a lot happens.

I think that was kind of the point. It's a slice of life fic. It was about dealing with the aftermath of canon, not introducing a new plotline really.

I thought the characterization was really good. It's been a few weeks since I finished it so it's not fresh in my mind, but I remember particularly liking the characterization of Ron.
