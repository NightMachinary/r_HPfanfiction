This was one of the first stories I've read since getting in to HP fic. On the one hand I really do enjoy seeing how things unfolded for the gang following the last battle, now that I've re-skimmed for this book club I find it lacks a little in terms of plot for me. I like slice of life and recovery stories but I think the author does a bit better in subsequent stories in the series with pacing and plot. The characters ring very true in all this author's work too, so I am that much more forgiving of anything else.

I will say this definitely has a fond place in my fic heart, even if I've read some more engaging stuff since. I think it does a good job of showing the characters cope with all that's happened, but also how they are developing as adults too.
