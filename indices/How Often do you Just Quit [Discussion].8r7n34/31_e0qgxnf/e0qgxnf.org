You aren't the only one! If a story isn't, well, just about the greatest thing since sliced bread I will drop it if it contains a pet peeve of mine (for example pregnancy, pairings that make no sense (which includes Ron/Hermion, Tonks/Lupin, Harry/Ginny, Ginny or Hermione/Draco etc.), magical cores (don't like this plot device! Especially since it IMHO doesn't make sense! A magical being has magic everywhere in there body, not just in some ball in the chest or something like that!), Hermione worship ("Greatest/Smartest witch of her age!" - Stop it! We know she is intelligent, but she's nowhere near Dumbledore or Voldemort, much less Merlin and Morgana!) etc.)

Also: Yes, the more fanfiction I read, the pickier I get :(
