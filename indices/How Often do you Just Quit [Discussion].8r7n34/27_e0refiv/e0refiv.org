I usually drop fics when they try to make me care about OC's or just change POV's to make the MC look cooler/Scarier/etc.

Or when they use banter instead of regular interactions.

Or when there's so much tropes that you can already see where everything's going, like dumb but manipulative dumbledore.

Or the moment I see ''don't like, don't read'' I know I won't like it. Thank's for the warning tho'!
