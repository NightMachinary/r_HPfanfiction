I only quit reading if I find the conflic to just be drawn out melodrama. Like I was reading this Hermione/Riddle fic and it was kinda silly how the author kept using (rather abusive) plot points just to further the relationship. I'll usually skip to the last few chapters for the happy ending.

Also, for slowburn fics I just quit when the UST is resolved through a love scene. It just doesn't seem interesting to read about how the relationship will end especially if I know it's a happy ending.

Similar to OP, I prefer reading (and writing) 1,2,3 shots. I'm more of a short story / poetry person myself and I find that the shorter the story, the bigger the challenge to flesh out a compelling plot and character. Usually the writing's better too.
