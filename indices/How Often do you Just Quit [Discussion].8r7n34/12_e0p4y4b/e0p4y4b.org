I quit fairly often in stories that aren't finished and are currently updating. They tend to go in directions I don't particularly enjoy (expanding on my least favourite aspects of the story).

Finished stories I don't quit if it's not a long story even though I'm not enjoying it, I'll still finish even though I wasn't really a fan. Elsewise I'll skip to the last few chapters or so.
