The entire 7 book series by Rowling is almost 1.1M words. I was reading a story that seemed like they took 500k words to get through a year. I don't need to know exactly what Harry eats everyday, a complete play by play of every Quidditch match, and what everyone got for Christmas down to the most intricate detail.
