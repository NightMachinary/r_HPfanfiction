It happens every few months for me, I always get bored reading a single fandom for too long, too many canon repeats just wear me down over time. I am a total addict to fanfiction though, so instead I will just switch fandoms. These days its the MCU which is a mixed bag but lots of new stuff to entertain. My favourites list these days has over 20 fandoms in it, always something good to discover the wider you cast the net.
