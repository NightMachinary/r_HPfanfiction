Some tropes you only can read so often before you realize that there has to be some sort of schematic for them to download and fill in the blanks. Especially awful are Lord Potter fics, or the like. I have read the exact same Gringotts scene... 20 times by now? Maybe more. Its ridiculous how copypasted they seem.

But those aren't the only ones. My flair might tell you what gets me to cancel out very quickly.

Shitty romance, magical vows dropped like candy at a birthday party, bashing,...

A lot of stuff gets me to just quit nowadays.
