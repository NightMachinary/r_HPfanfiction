It really depends. I'll quit early fairly easily, but later only if the fic is really boring me or /really/ fucking with my emotions. The former is reasonably common, the latter has only happened very rarely, only once recently.

I was reading linkffn[12076911] (Unknowns, Part The Second, by Charlotte Blackwood. In case the bot decides to ignore me.) and it just fucked me up emotionally. *Spoilers:* I got super attached to the characters, and then realized I was going to have to go through like thirty to forty chapters of them being sexually and emotionally abused through their addiction to a drug. I just.. couldn't do it. It was like 100 chapters of finding out what these characters mean to each other, how their parents feel. And now that. I skipped to the end, where the bad guy gets what they fuckin deserve. Read that chapter, put it down. I might finish one day, but I dunno.
