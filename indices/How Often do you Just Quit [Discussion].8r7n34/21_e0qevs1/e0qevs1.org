Oh, all the time. I mean I like Harry/Daphne so I have to put up with a lot of bullshit in my fics, but even so, I just stop reading a lot of the fics I pick up. The most common reason I quit on a fic is I just start to get bored with it. Usually, I get bored because a fic has bad pacing and or the same few things happen every chapter. Particularly egregious spelling/grammar errors or typos (especially frequent ones) will get me to stop reading too. Also, I have certain tropes or characters that are too OOC without significant changes to canon that will get me to drop a fic. Basically, anything, where James and Lily are still alive but either treat Harry poorly, or for example, faked their death, is an instant later, bitch!
