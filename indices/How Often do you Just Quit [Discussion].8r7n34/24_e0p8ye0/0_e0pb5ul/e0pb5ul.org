Noted, but there is a difference between "not my cuppa tea" and "not even a hot cup of tea."

If it is written poorly, then leaving a terse review is up to the perogative of the reader. In [[/u/MindForgedManacle]] 's case, it seems they most likely mean poorly done cliches or overused cliches. Or romances that are not romances.

Up to the reader, then. We could go all day over "terseness" and intention, but then if I get a terse review and stew over it for days in a depressed slump, then I need to learn to stick it to my readers and write *my story*.

I read one such story where the writer continuously got flak for the amount of smut in their story. Their response, succinctly, was to /write more smut/. It was hilarious, and consequently not my cuppa tea, but I enjoyed their attitude.

Don't fret the small things. If you do, refer back to my previous sentence. At the same time, if a small thing is "you make your charachters sound dry and cutout" - and they really are, then you have choices. Listen and ignore them. Listen and try to write better and ignore the narrow minded flames, or reason that they don't get what you're selling and ignore them anyway.
