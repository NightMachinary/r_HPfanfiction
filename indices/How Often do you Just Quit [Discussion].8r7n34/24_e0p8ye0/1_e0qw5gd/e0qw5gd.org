Firstly every review on ff.net helps a story because lots of people only pick stories with a high amount of reviews. I know I only ever read reviews for a fic if I already don't like it or something crazy happened because I want to see how other people reacted.

It's also ridiculous to say it's “rude” to give a review about the things you don't like. Reviews aren't there just to point out spelling mistakes and kiss the authors arse.
