The whole point of the review is to tell the author what you think of their story. Saying you dislike aspects of there story is just as valid as telling them what they can do better. The readers aren't beholden to the author just as the author is not beholden to the readers.

It's called a /review/ for a reason. Saying what you liked and disliked are part of that. It's subjective.
