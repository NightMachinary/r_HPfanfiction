No, it isn't. Just telling someone you don't like A or B is in no way constructive or helpful because they will probably have another review telling them how much they like A or B. Expressing your preferences is not constructive criticism because it is about /you/ and not about the writing. Telling someone how and why you came to have that preference in their work /is/ useful because it can help the writer decide if they are reaching their desired audience or not.
