Hey I can totally understand dropping something because you don't like it but leaving a "terse review" because something isn't to your taste just seems rude.

And by that I mean just because you don't like melodrama or drawn out slow burns or even things you consider OOC doesn't make them "crap" - it just means /YOU don't like them/ and were not the intended audience. There are plenty of people who *do* obviously or they wouldn't be writing so many of them.
