My point was that something is not bad simply because you dislike it. I dislike sushi but it doesn't mean sushi is "crap" food. In the initial post you didn't say the writing was poor you just listed things you didn't like about it. If the writing or plotting is bad offering criticism is fine and possibly useful.
