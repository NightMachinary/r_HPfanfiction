One thing I've noticed that is pissing me off more and more, is Harry coming to the realisation over summer, that he just loves flying, he actually hates quidditch. He then proceeds, as a 13/14 y/o boy, entirely of his own volition, to go to his Head of House, the Headmaster, all other teachers, and probably sends a message to Rolf Harris, saying that his studies are far too important, and he would be dropping out of the quidditch team forthwith, as its "the mature thing to do"

It just comes across as poor writing.. I get some people hate quidditch because it's broken etc, but at least be creative in how you drop it, don't repeat the same tired ideas. This is what led to me dropping a few of my last stories I tried to read
