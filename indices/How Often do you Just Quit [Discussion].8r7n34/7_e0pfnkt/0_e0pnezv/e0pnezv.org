  I get some people hate quidditch because it's broken etc, but at least be creative in how you drop it, don't repeat the same tired ideas

But... the story isn't about how Harry decided to drop Quidditch and the intricacies of that decision. It would be stupid to write a whole complex story arc about a topic that is not relevant to the story. Him just deciding to not do it anymore is a decent way to get the topic out of the way.

Same with stories where Harry stops being friends with Ron. For some reason some people expect these stories to have a deep and complex analysis of Ron and his friendship with Harry, which would be the opposite of the original purpose.
