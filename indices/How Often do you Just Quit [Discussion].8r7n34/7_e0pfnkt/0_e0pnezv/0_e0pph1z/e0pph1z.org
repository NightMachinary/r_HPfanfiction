  For some reason some people expect these stories to have a deep and complex analysis of Ron and his friendship with Harry, which would be the opposite of the original purpose.

There are quite a few points where you can drop the Ron friendship without too much drama and still keep Harry and Ron in character (so no secret Death Eater plots or similar stupidity)

1. Ron's celebrity awe on the Hogwarts Express making Harry uncomfortable.

2. The Troll incident, or more accurately Ron making Hermione cry. Not that Harry would throw a fit or anything, but it could make him very uncomfortable (Am I becoming Dudley?)

3. Ron's treatment of Hermione over Scabbers. Had he been right, his behaviour would have been perfectly justified. But as a matter of fact Crookshanks did not eat Pettigrew and therefore he spent 9 months falsely accusing Harry's friend (and never apologised on screen). Fairly easy to write the end of their friendship there.

4. Ron's fit over the Goblet. Trust is perhaps the most difficult thing to rebuild and it would not be out of character for Harry to not be as forgiving as in canon. He holds his grudge over Stan surprisingly long.

5. Lavender. I mean, I am pretty sure that most teenage boys, my past-self included, would rather spend some quality time with their 10/10 girlfriend than worry about death and destruction. The trio drifting apart because Ron, like most of us, thinks with his lower head wouldn't be too difficult to sell.

6. The Horcrux-induced flight. Ron never finds them, broken trust cannot be regained, Harry doesn't take Ron back without the life-saving event, Ron gets caught and/or killed... Take your pick, there's plenty to choose from.
