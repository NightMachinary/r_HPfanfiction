I guess I confused everyone there. I wasn't looking for a specific story, I was looking for a category of story. FF's search for a specific story does suck donkey balls, I just use google to find a particular story rather than use theirs. But for filtering stories to find a story with general topics or ideas, FF is superior to ao3 imo.
