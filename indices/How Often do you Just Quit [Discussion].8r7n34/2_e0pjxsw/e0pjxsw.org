Poor writing style will make me drop a story really fast. It bugs me tremendously when a story can be good, but the author decided to write one paragraph with three different people speaking in it. Shit like that makes it hard to keep track of what's going on.

Or when people write multiple PoVs within one section of a story.

Like:

/Harry walked into the living room at Grimmauld Place to deathly silence, he wasn't aware of anything he'd done, but when he looked at Ron, he knew something was up./

/Ron, meanwhile, was furious with his so-called best friend, how dare he.../

God, it annoys me so much. If you write a part of your story, please please /please/ write it from one person's point of view!

Or dumb shit like: Moldyshorts, Dumbles, etc...
