I know one exception to that rule, but it is generally a good heuristic. Although personally, I find the first chapter a lot more telling because it gives you a better image over the frequency of those mistakes. 5 mistakes in a 4k chapter I can live with, 5 per 100 words is atrocious.

Frankly, a mistake can happen to anyone. I proofread all my chapters, run two spell-checks over it and yet constantly find (minor) mistakes in my already published chapters.
