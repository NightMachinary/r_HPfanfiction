I'm SUPER picky about my fanfiction. I ditch most of them in the first chapter or two. It can usually be pretty obvious what kind of author you're dealing with in that first chapter or two. Sometimes I get halfway before realizing I'm not going to see anything new or that the things I was ignoring because something showed potential aren't worth it anymore.
