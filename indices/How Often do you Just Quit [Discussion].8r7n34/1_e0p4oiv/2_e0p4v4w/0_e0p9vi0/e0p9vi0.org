I don't really read the comic-based ones, but rather on the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) ones. I prefer the movies to the comics. The comics have always been too inconsistent and convoluted for me.

I honestly only have like one Fallout fic saved, and it's not a crossover or anything. It's a Fallout 4 story, and I personally found it absolutely hilarious. Though it might not be for everyone.
