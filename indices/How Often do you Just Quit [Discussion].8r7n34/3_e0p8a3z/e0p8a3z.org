It's a combination of pickiness concerning headcanon and preferred fanon, high standards, and just plain burnout. This is what I'm going through now. I have dropped multiple fics that I have previously enjoyed because that last chapter just rubbed me the wrong way in some small manner and I just didn't care enough to continue. Now only crossovers and [[/r/HFY]] are enough to interest me. Everything else is just bloody stale or not to my taste.

It doesn't help that almost every author can't follow a schedule. That itself isn't a huge problem, but if they don't turn each chapter into a proper serial fic that constantly re-engages my interest, instead slowly putting out something that is meant to be read all in one go, it really turns me off of what I'm reading.
