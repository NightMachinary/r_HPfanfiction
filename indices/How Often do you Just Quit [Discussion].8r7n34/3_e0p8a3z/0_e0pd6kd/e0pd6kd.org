I totally get the second point. I've been reading this fic from another fandom and the author is vveerrryy slow in updating. In the past six years of writing the story they're only 20 chapters in a planned 60 chapter story. It doesn't help that whenever they update, it's just a filler chapter with no purpose in furthering the plot. I get that not everyone can commit to a regular writing-and-posting routine, but I would appreciate it if they label it as under a semi-hiatus, instead of making people wait.
