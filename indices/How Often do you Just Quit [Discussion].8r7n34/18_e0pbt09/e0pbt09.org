I can deal with a lot of crap but when an author constantly and frequently uses the wrong words to describe something I usually end up tapping out. Arithmetic instead of arithmancy, Trail instead of trial, cloths instead of clothes, I can go on for hours...

Case in point: story recently popped up on here that I wanted to read but oh my God the misspellings... Linkffn(Harry Potter and the magic of life)
