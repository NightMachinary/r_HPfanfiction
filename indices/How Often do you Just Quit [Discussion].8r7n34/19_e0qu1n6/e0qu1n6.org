I started reading The Greengrass Contract and dropped it halfway through the first chapter. Along with Harry telling the goblin to call him Harry instead of Mr Potter (which seemed bizarre) it also had one of the most stupid sentences in a fanfic I've ever read:

#+begin_quote
  To Peter Pettigrew, we leave 2,500 galleons. Sorry, Peter, but we all know that we never really were very good friends, but we feel that we can trust you enough for you to be the Secret-Keeper.
#+end_quote

I mean, how can you continue on with the story after reading that flaming pile of garbage. It also mentions that the will was observed by Dumbledore, Lupin, and Sirius but apparently they skimmed over the part where they say that Peter will be the secret-keeper...
