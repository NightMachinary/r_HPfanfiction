The Obscurus is ripped from the Obscurial and bound to the Horcrux (In my fic, horcruxes have the additional function of being high-power batteries of dark magic, which is used to power its defenses and absorbs any dark magic it comes across if its separated from said defenses.) The Horcrux (in this case, a ritual dagger) is fused with a willing Dark Wizard (Not the one who created the Horcrux, mind you), creating a nigh-unstoppable demonic entity with a penchant for tearing its victims entrails apart from the inside.
