Spoiler for my fic: Combining an Obscurus with a Horcrux and fusing it with a dark wizard creates a malevolent, parasitic entity that is next-to impossible to destroy, and can survive the death of its host and possess a new host who is emotionally vulnerable.

Also, incubating a fire crab egg in manticore blood is how you create a Blast-Ended Skrewt.
