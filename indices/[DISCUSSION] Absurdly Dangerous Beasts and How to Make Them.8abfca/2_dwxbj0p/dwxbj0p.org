Malobscudementisk (Maledictus/Obscurus + Dementor + Basilisk)

Like a Dementor, it's indestructible unless you've got something like Fiendfyre, and it can suck out your will to live and your soul. Like a Basilisk, looking it in the eyes is fatal, and it has venom that can destroy anything. Like a Maledictus, it's originally an innocent person who may turn into that heartless monstrosity at /any moment/ --- additionally making it harder to decide to buckle up and put it down if you ever figure out how.
