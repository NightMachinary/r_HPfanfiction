[Not part of the fic here, commentary. You are cornering this into drama/romance between Harry and Draco, but even if they are lovers in this fic, Harry has shown signs of serious mental instability/evil, and at the same time Draco's family is being held hostage. No matter how much they are in love with each other, Draco shouldn't have adoration right now. Harry is trying to convince Draco to kill him if necessary, and at the same time they are to perform an unavoidable ritual they both loathe. My implications being that it was sending the scar horcrux into Pansy, polyjuicing her, and having Voldemort kill her (dunno about everyone else). But regardless of all that, the "shining in adoration" kills the pacing and kills the fic.]
