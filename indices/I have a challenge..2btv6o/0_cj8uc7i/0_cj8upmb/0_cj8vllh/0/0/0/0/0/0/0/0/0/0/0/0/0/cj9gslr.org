[I am going to continue the story as it's written in this post. I agree that under the circumstances, adoration is probably not reasonable. I also have a hard time seeing Harry advocating killing anybody even if mentally unstable. That said, as I see it the point of this topic is to build off of what came before you. If you don't see the previous posts as reasonable under the circumstances, or you think the story is moving in a direction you don't agree with, your remedy isn't to outright disregard what was written, but to find a creative way to change the direction or shed light on the previous posts that changes how they're viewed without having to disregard them. Harry Potter is one of the few stories out there where "A Wizard Did It" is an acceptable explanation. Let's get creative!]

Draco had always been a bastard, but he wasn't heartless. Even if he really didn't love Pansy--and there was a good chance he didn't--he still hadn't given her up when she messed with Neville's Transfigurations and McGonnagle blamed him. Served three weeks of detention for it. Harry looked him hard in the eyes. Adoration. Of all the times for someone to have slipped him a love potion. "Draco," Harry said, "I need you to concentrate for this. Someone could die here. You understand that, right?"
