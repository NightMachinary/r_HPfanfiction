"If this ritual doesn't work, that is the backup plan. I'm going to be magically exhausted, and, given failure, he'll still be in my head. I need you to be ready to use it on me within seconds of ritual failure. Fiendfyre would also work, but you still can't control it, can you? I need you to be able to hate me again, enough to cast it within about 10 seconds of the ritual. If you can't, and he takes control, he could destroy everyone and everything at Hogwarts, starting with you."
