I can't think of any that fits this description to the word, but a few similar ideas come to mind, which might hopefully somewhat resemble what you were looking for.

linkffn(Imprisoned Realm) has a DE Harry that no one knew about until it was too late. But there's more to him than meets the eye. To say more would be spoiling it, but I think you might like it if you bear with the pace for a bit. It's a few chapters short of finishing and the author updated recently.

linkffn(A Soulless Solace) is slash, and Tom/Harry at that, but extremely (and I mean /extremely/) well written and a wild, wild ride. The Horror genre isn't just for laughs here. This one actually fits your description of him going dark in 6th year, and he does a lot of hiding. Warnings: it's on a hiatus, and toward the end of the existing chapters Tom is resurrected into a girl's body and proclaims herself a transsexual. I personally enjoyed the first 16 or so chapters. One way or another, the writing quality is sound - not just sound, but superb, at least to me.

linkffn(Friend or Foe by Niger Aquila) is an old one, but it has the whole Harry going dark and trying to hide it from his friends thing. He's also chummy with Malfoy. It's set in 5th year, but it fits a great many of your criteria, though for the sake of not spoiling the story I won't go into detail as to which ones.

Hope any of this might be of help.
