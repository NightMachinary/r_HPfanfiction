I'd imagine that if dimension hopping is a thing, with hundred of lives Hedwig has seen it. Not only that, but she'd have been intrigued enough to learn it. Oh god, imagine if she set up an island of the lost with every orphaned/crappy childhood protagonist in existence and their sidekicks. Then she gets manuals on every form of ability/magic from their native worlds and makes Harry, et all learn everything.
