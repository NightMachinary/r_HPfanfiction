One of my fics had the two of them teaming up to make sure Pettigrew got captured as he tried to flee after Voldemort's final defeat: >! Hedwig followed him from the air, marking his position; she couldn't attack for fear of getting cursed, but he couldn't transform to cast at her without drawing attention and getting caught. Eventually, following Hedwig, Crookshanks managed to lead a group of pursuers right to him.!<
