Love it! That sounds so fun! Hedwig got the short end of the stick anyway, so a powerful magical familiar sounds like a fantastic character to play with.

Additionally I can see it play out that she and Crookshanks team up to unmask Pettigrew and force him out of his Scabbers body in front of the entire school, leading to McGonagal screaming that he's alive.

This has potential in so many directions.
