Harry had to clarify with the DA members on what was actually fact during Ootf. I imagine everyone heard the true story, along with dozens of others. It seemed to be very impactful when Harry clarified that it had been Voldemort on the back of Quirrel's head, so it's likely that even if people had heard it, most didn't actually believe it.
