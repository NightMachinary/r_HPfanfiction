Year 1, probably everything Ron and Hermione witnessed was common knowledge, which means the students had a pretty good idea of what was in the obstacle course. (Percy was openly talking about "McGonagall's giant chess set.")

They had to know Quirrell was involved because he's the one who died/disappeared. As [[/u/Lord-Potter-Black][u/Lord-Potter-Black]], mentioned, Neville knew the Philosopher's Stone was involved (even though that seems one of the least likely things to get out). And Ron and Hermione could have told people their suspicion that Voldemort was involved, so it could have been everything except for Quirrell being possessed.

Year 2, I suspect a lot less, or at least a highly distorted story to protect Ginny. The students were probably told that the monster was a basilisk and that Harry killed it (and that Hagrid was innocent). I'm not sure what Dumbledore would have said publicly about the Heir/Heir's agent that would have satisfied the students, though. He probably wouldn't have mentioned the diary; yet, people could do a headcount and determine that no one was expelled.

Year 3, Harry would have told everyone who would listen the truth about Sirius and Peter. Unfortunately, very few people listened, and he didn't actually get much opportunity. But everything before the time turner was probably there for people who wanted to know.
