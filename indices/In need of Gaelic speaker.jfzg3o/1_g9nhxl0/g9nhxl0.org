But do you really need it to be translated into Gaelic?

When I encounter phrases in languages I don't know I just skip them. No point reading them if I don't understand them. It's very irritating actually.

I think it's much better to write something in italics and mention that it's in another language. Like this:

#+begin_quote
  "/Hello, how are you?/" Harry said in French.

  "/I'm fine./" answered his French friend.
#+end_quote
