There are only around 57k Scottish Gaelic speakers left in Scotland (around 1% of Scots) according to the govt figures, so it's actually quite hard to find them.

You'd be better trying a forum like Fòram na Gàidhlig to stand much chance of reaching fluent speakers than a US-centric Harry Potter subreddit.
