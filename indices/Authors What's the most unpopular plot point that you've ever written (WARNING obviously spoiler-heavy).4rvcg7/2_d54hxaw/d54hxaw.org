Not so much a plot point as a style. I don't feel every question I raise as a writer needs to be answered in the text. Peronally I enjoy books that leave me with questions and a sense of wonder. I also loath exposition and try to avoid it where possible.

As an example, my Harry is searching for a new wand in the RoR where the Diadem is. He finds a chest of test wands made by an ancestor of Ollivander. Harry tries the wand, it works and so far doesn't bother to find out what it's made out of.

It is in part a reaction to the tropes where Harry gets a super cool basilisk venom and Voldemort hair fluid core wand made from the gold plated root of Yggdrasil.... I like the idea of my readers wondering what Harry's wand might be, especially when it starts acting oddly.
