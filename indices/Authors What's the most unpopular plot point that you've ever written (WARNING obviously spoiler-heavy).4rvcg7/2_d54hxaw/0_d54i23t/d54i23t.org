Oh I forgot, I also change Harry's name which some people will immediately drop a fic for doing. However I set it up as both a joke and to show how detached/unstable Harry has become after being alone for so long. Through out the story it keeps coming to bite him in the arse, but I suspect a number of people will see the name change and bail in the same sentence!
