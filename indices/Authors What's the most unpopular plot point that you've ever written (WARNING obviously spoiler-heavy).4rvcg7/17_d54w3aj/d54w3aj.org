It wasn't a huge reaction, because I don't have a huge amount of readers on any of my fics, but in my first finished and posted HP fic, I had a few readers who got annoyed enough to start an argument in the comments. I assume they left, because they never commented again.

The story was a post-Hogwarts AU Lucius/Hermione, Draco/Ginny wangsty romance piece. The readers in question were angry because, for literally three lines, Lucius and Ginny interacted. Ginny was flippant, Lucius was fragile, and Hermione was inwardly horrified at her behaviour. The readers weren't happy because they felt Ginny was justified in being flippant, and in fact could be a total bitch to him without being out of line, considering what he had done to her. This was addressed later in the fic, but they didn't know that. I didn't really expect anyone to react to it simply because it was a /very/ brief moment.

I totally understand where they were coming from - but I wouldn't change it. It would have derailed the fic to address Ginny and Lucius's past history at that time, and I still think they all acted within the confines of their characters as I understand them. I'm sorry people got upset (and started attacking each other over it, leading me to delete all of the comments), but I can't write a story if I'm spending all my time worrying that people might get upset. Things in real life aren't always PC and fair, so they're not always going to be in stories, either, or else the stories won't be realistic.

All anyone can do is try to make the best choices they can for the story and then stick by it. If people get upset - it's a risk you take no matter what you write. The greatest disservice we can do to our stories is not be confident in them and stand by them. Sure, everyone has room for improvement and should be open to constructive criticism, but there's also a time to stick to your guns, readers being angry about the events of the story for no other reason than their opinion is one of those times.
