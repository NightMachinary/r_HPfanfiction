Read at your own risk - it was the first long fic I ever completed, I posted it as I wrote, and I would change a lot of things if I could go back and do it over (not the part I mentioned above, but lots of other things). I don't regret writing it, as I had a lot of fun and learned a lot, but...it's not great.

I have to finish my current WIP, but after that, never posting as I write again. :/
