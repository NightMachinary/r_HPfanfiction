  This highlights what I think is a bit of a problem in fanfic readers--a lot of them seem to expect problems to get solved /asap/.

I'll play the devil's advocate for a bit there and say that, in their defence, way too many fanfic authors never actually get to solving those problems if they don't do it as soon as they happen and have the story progressing as the problem automatically got solved by fuck-if-we-know-what because it's inconvenient for them to actually try resolving it in-story (for whatever reason). With that, the expectations change, and though the /good/ authors tend not to do stuff as stupid as that, the amount of bad authors is far greater than the amount of good authors and many people do read even rubbish before they actually get to reading the better stuff and start rejecting the bad.

In other words, it's bad that it happens and it should not be happening and the authors should not pander to that particular ... viewpoint of some of their readers, but the fact that people want that is not /wholly/ unjustified.

Although, of course, some readers simply are that immature and aren't capable of following the plot whatsoever. That happens too, and those ones have no excuse.
