  This was addressed later in the fic, but they didn't know that. I didn't really expect anyone to react to it simply because it was a very brief moment.

This highlights what I think is a bit of a problem in fanfic readers--a lot of them seem to expect problems to get solved /asap/. This is pure theory, but in reading books there's the expectation that a problem will be solved by the end of the story so you're content to read it all and see where the problem's solution comes, but with fanfic where you're getting chapter-by-chapter updates (unless you read it later) there seems to be an expectation of problems being solved not long, or even immediately, after they're presented.

I wonder if they forget that there's a whole story to be told and it can't all be done in one chapter. Or if they want the details of a story without the effort of reading--I just remembered a reviewer I had who sent me PMs asking if certain things would happen, or how the relationships between certain conflicting characters would evolve, and all the questions were things that would be answered /in the story/ once I got that far.

Readers need to remember that stories are meant to create questions and present issues, but you can't expect an author to answer and resolve them immediately. At least wait until the story is finished before complaining about an author failing to deliver in some way.
