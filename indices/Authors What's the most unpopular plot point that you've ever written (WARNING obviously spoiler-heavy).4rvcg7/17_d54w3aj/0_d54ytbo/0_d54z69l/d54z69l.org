It may be pure theory, but it's a theory I completely agree with! Even with my current story, people want to know plot points and details ahead of time. I understand to a point - they're anxious, my update schedule had been regular but got interrupted - but a part of me just wants to tell them to cut it out! Be patient! You'll find out almost everything you want to know in due course. :P If they really can't take it, I wish they'd wait to read it until the whole thing is up, like a lot of people on this sub do.
