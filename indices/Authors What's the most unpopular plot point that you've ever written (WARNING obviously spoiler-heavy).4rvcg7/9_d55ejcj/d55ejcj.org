In the very beginning of my story, the protagonists' plight was set in motion by a house elf's magic. Many readers - having been raised on a fanfic diet of 'Dobby fixes everything' - wondered why my plot was taking so long to resolve itself.

Edit: oh, and basically any scene with Ron was a magnet for bashing requests and accusations that I wasn't treating him fairly.
