I made Hermione legally defend Draco in a sideplot and made up my own rules about the obviously dodgy Wizarding legal system. This one reviewer left a review on every chapter at ao3 explaining why I was an idiot and how this couldn't be legally possible (even when it actually could) - and then found the fic at ff.net and left reviews there. Dedicated little fellow.
