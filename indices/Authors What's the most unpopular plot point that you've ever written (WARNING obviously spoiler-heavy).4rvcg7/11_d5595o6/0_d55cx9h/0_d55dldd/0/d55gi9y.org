OMG you're perverse_idyll?

Also, thank you. Now that I know it's you I'm kinda afraid to read it haha. When people kill their characters off I usually don't buy it because not many people are good enough writers to either make me connect with the characters or not make death seem like a cheap and easy way to artificially induce feelings into the reader, but you're not/wouldn't do either of those things.

Alsooo... I'm very happy to see you here, didn't expect that. Are you still writing? Are you really going to post the long version sometimes soon? Do you need help with anything?
