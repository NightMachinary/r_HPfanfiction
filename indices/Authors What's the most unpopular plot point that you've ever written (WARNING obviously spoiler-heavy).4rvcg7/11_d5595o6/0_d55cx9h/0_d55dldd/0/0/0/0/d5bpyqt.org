Oh, I know what you mean about favorite writers leaving fandom. Or jumping ship to other pairings where I can't follow. There are so many people I miss, people who made my HP experience a giddy thing full of wonderful stories and heated discussion. And yes, agreed, I too have a very decided preference when it comes to the Snape/Harry dynamic. I want them to work for it and I want the hostility between them to be an issue. I don't want their relationship to be mellow and comfortable. They're both damaged, albeit in different ways, and their shared history is a minefield. That dynamic used to be more common. I enjoy happy endings as much as the next person, but I prefer having my heart ripped out on the way to being healed.

Things are ... hmm. Better than they were, thank you. But still not good. I'll get there eventually.

(Sorry for the delayed response - I tend to vanish during the work week because it wipes me out. Speaking of which, I'd better get to bed before I fall asleep on the keyboard.)
