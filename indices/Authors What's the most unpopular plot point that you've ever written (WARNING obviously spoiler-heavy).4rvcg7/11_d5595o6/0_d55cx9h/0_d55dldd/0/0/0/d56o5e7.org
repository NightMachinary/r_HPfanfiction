That was such a nice and thoughtful reply and reading it made me happy, thank you :)

Of course I know who you are. Most, if not all, of my favorite writers quit writing and that makes me sad because snarry is my macaroni and cheese. I like certain things and a certain dynamic and for things to be pretty grimdark in general and that was pretty rare even while HP/snarry were very very popular. That's part of why I'm so excited to see you here.

I am sad to hear about the tough times. Are things getting better?
