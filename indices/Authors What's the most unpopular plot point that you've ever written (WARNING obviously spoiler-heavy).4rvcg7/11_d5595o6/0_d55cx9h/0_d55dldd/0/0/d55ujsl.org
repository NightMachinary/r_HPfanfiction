Whoa, you recognize my name? That's unexpected. And extremely flattering, especially coming from this part of HP fandom. :)

The Lost World may or may not be satisfying because it does pull the rug out from under reader expectations. It's based more on a fairytale/folklore sense of logic and fate - the darker tradition, where breaking your promise has consequences - than on standard HP tropes, which means the whole fic is a bit strange. The predominant magic is borrowed from older tales like Tam Lin and isn't as whimsical as the usual Potter style.

Aw, it's nice to be missed! I mostly lurk and dabble in fandom these days, although I never stop hoping that I'll find the wherewithal to write again. Or rather, finish all the things I started. Life has been rough for the past few years, and I haven't had the time or energy - the easy pleasure in dreaming up stories and playing with words - that I need in order to write well. Or at all, actually. I'm trying to write a smut fic right now because I assumed it would be self-indulgent and simple enough, and that finishing it might break my writer's block. Gah. Wrong. Nothing involving words is ever easy. Even PWPs require concentration.

I haven't looked at the long version of Lost World for a while, but I really should revise it and get it out there. It's got scenes and moments I really like, and the ending is ... interesting. I'd be curious to hear whether it works for people.

It's so kind of you to ask! Thank you! But no. I just have to keep on keeping on until things get better.
