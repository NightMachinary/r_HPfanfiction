I killed Snape at the end of a Snape/Harry fic. Needless to say, if you're writing ship fic, it's not a popular move to kill off one half of your pairing. Your natural audience will be horrified and not inclined to forgive you, and readers who once trusted you will be hesitant to take a chance on your work after that.

I actually chose that ending because it fit the theme and I couldn't write the story I wanted to write due to word count limitations (this was for a fest). The full-length fic with the original ending is five times as long, and while Snape is still alive at the end, it calls into question whether his survival - and what it means for Harry - is really a better fate.

Death fic is always a hard sell, though. Most readers consider it too much of a downer.
