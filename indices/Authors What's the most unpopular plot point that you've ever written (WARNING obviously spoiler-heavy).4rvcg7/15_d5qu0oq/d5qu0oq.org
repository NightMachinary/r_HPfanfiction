I am writing a fic about Harry/Hermione/Ron/Ginny post war, focusing on the angst and such from going through a war. The characters are supposed to be messed up, and I wrote a chapter where Ron had been moody all day (unnecessarily angry, totally lost his shit at Hermione for no reason) and then he pissed off Harry who hit him. Their fight /really/ pissed of my readers. Still, I'm happy I wrote it. It is the whole plot to show their growth, which means showing where they started.

Seriously though I had one particular reader get very passionate that Harry deserved to go to Azcaban, and at the least never be an auror. I did my best to explain and in the end we had a very calm discussion but he felt the story was ruined.
