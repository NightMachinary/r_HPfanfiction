I have so many to choose from...

I'd guess the most discontent was created when Holly discovered she'd been mutated by the ordeal of fighting against the basilisk and then being cured by phoenix tears. The reveal was intentionally gruesome, but I found a particular division between male and female readership on this point: many guy readers said 'I'm outta here!' while for the most part the girls were 'Gee, thanks for reminding me of how it felt during my first period, jerk.' But then they'd keep reading.

How I felt: this was where I wanted to go. Every other story had magical influences giving the MC superpowers with no downside at all. I wanted to explore dark magic where the side effects really put into question whether the benefit was worth it.

Eventually the whole story turned into an allegory for a girl's (metaphoric) lifecycle, but that was the start of it and I was willing to lose readership to go where others feared to tread. Otherwise what was the point- make yet another ho-hum empowerment fantasy?
