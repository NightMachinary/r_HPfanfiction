At one point, relatively early in the fic, Sirius is captured by Pettigrew. There were some disgruntled readers who questioned Peter's ability to capture Sirius, calling him incompetent and a coward (you know, fanon bashed Peter). One reviewer on FFN sent me a detailed PM about how it was inconceivable that Voldemort didn't immediately summon all his Death Eaters so they could stand in a circle and take turns torturing Sirius in various creative ways once Peter brought him in. Then when the next update dropped and I had Voldemort and Sirius talking over dinner, another PM followed, talking at length about how I don't know how to write a "realistic" Voldemort. I got a good laugh out of that one.
