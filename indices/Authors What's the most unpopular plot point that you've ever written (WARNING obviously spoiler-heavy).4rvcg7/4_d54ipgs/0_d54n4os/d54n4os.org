It's strange, that. I only remember thinking "Damn, well /somebody/ done fucked up!" after reading that scene. Peter's competence aside, the idea of him getting the drop on Sirius is pretty darned realistic.

When it comes to realistic portrayals of Voldemort, I'd always make sure to point people in the direction of Lesser Evils. In stories where Voldemort is a thing, it's nice to be able to read through a whole scene where he doesn't even lift his wand, let alone kill three of his followers for sneezing.
