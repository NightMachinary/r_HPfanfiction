For my fic at the moment, the biggest tantrums I have received - and I definitely view them as tantrums in this because, as they're childish and ridiculous - were from an "unexpected" scene where Harry kisses Blaise some way into the fic.

For some reason, this scene was COMPLETELY unexpected, despite the fact that for the last two years at Hogwarts, Harry had regularly displayed attraction to both boys and girls, and it had even been outright discussed by him and Hermione.

For the fic, I'm going to be portraying more realistic teenage relationships - basically Harry and other teenagers are regularly getting into Oh-So-Serious and not so serious relationships and then breaking apart, because that's what teenagers do.

I'm aware that by the end of the series, when Harry is not in a relationship with anyone, there'll be irritation from the readers who are currently demanding that Harry, Luna and Blaise all get married together.

Because that's TOTALLY realistic.

Ships aside, I think other things will upset some readers - I'm killing off some favourite characters of both my own and the readers, and there's not going to be an out-and-out happy ending. I think there'll always be readers who get angry at that sort of thing.

But for the most part, I think ANY plot point will be well-received by the majority of your readers if it's executed well - focus on how you're writing and how it affects your plot. The more sensitive readers who throw tantrums and leave will only leave ONE review - the readers who keep going will leave you more, you know?
