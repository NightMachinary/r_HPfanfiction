My OC in Aurors is not naturally brave. She's had to learn on the job. She's a young girl who hasn't seen much violence. So when she sees her first dead body (horrifically mutilated with the heart missing), she loses it a bit and panics. I regard this as a common reaction to gruesome scenes, and made it clear in the scene that although she was frightened, she gathers herself together enough to move forward and spot a rather important clue. I also had other characters (Harry) acknowledge it as a flaw, but have it pointed out to them (by Hermione) that everyone is sheltered compared to him.

Not good enough for the reviewers. They wanted her to kick ass from the start.

I even had someone send me a long and detailed message about how she's a nurse and if one of her students acted like that she'd fire them on the spot.

My OC is flawed, but I knew she'd develop and gradually learn, and now she seems relatively popular. I did try and assure reviewers of this, but I know I lost a few who gave up there and then. I found that I didn't really care enough to change anything I had planned, but I did feel a little hurt. I think having a smart, observant, brave, brilliant at fighting character is fine, but a little flat. I wanted Theia to be book smart and observant, but a little lacking in common sense and life experience. I know she's not for everyone - just like people in real life, you're not going to get on with everyone, but I will admit to being disappointed that that one plot point (minor in the grand scheme of things) was enough to make people give up entirely.
