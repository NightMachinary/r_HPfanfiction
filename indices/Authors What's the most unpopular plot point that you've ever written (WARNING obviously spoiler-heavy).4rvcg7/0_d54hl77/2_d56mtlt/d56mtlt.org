I haven't read this story, but the last I checked having an OC that kicks ass from the very beginning and has no flaws is almost guaranteed to be a recipe for a disaster. With that in mind, I wouldn't really care about the reviewers who are raising a ruckus about this at all; because really, they aren't worth your disappointment.

Also, the one who commented about being a nurse is flat-out stupid, mostly due to not actually thinking about the difference in circumstances before going holier-than-thou.
