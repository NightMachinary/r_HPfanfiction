Well, I think I remembered Ollivander saying something about the other person to have a Fawkes-feathered wand when Harry bought Holly. And my mind immediately went "well, no Voldemort but if the other wand gets mentioned, the person who wields it is probably important somehow." And then we get the Albatross mystery, which at first seems like it is Wormtail, but then we learn that's not the truth, and I doubt it is Sirius.

What odds did he give it?
