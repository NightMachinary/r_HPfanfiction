Seeing as your rendition of Hogwarts is pretty gritty from the get-go, I'd say that weak it's totally the wrong word to use there.

Even if it was a decision coming from the place of a broken spirit, Harry in HBS can and has been stone-cold and ruthless towards those who he regards as allies... that's hardly weak.
