I had some interesting reviews...

*SPOILER ALERT*

...at the end of CH45 of HBS. A lot of reviewers were unhappy when Harry turned around and returned to the castle. While there's an interesting conversation to be had on whether Harry was taking control of his life or if he had simply kept playing the game Snape laid out for him, there were plenty of reviewers who thought he should have said, "fuck it," and left.

It was not a vantage point I had ever really considered. Of course, there is a virulent strain of readers who are into independent Harry leaving the shadows of his elders and taking up independence with goblins, but I don't think HBS was ever that kind of story. It was still pretty interesting to see all the reviewers who thought Harry was weak for deciding to stay. Manipulated? Yes. Weak? I didn't expect to see that response.
