  While there's an interesting conversation to be had on whether Harry was taking control of his life or if he had simply kept playing the game Snape laid out for him, there were plenty of reviewers who thought he should have said, "fuck it," and left.

That's rather interesting, because I read the ending of chapter 45 as a "fuck it" moment. He was pretty set on leaving and said "fuck it, I ain't pussying out."
