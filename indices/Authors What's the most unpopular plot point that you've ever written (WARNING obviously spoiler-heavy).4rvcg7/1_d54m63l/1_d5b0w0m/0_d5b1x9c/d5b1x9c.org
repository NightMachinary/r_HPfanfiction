[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9265719/1/For-the-Price-of-a-Soul][For the Price of a Soul]], but it's not actually that good of a fic, IMO. I'd recommend my other fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11767424/1/Butterfly-Wings][Butterfly Wings]], which is a little shorter (still over 300k) but still tragic and better written both in terms of style and story. FPS mostly piles abuse on the characters just for the hell of it (too much so according to several reviewers) while BW is tragic in a more heartbreaking way.
