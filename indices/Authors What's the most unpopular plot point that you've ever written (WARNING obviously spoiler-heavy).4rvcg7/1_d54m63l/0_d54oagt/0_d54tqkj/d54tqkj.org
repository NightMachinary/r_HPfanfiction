my inspirational motivator, a professor I had in high school who loved teaching more than he loved money, and was a published author, stated to me in my freshmen year "Its not a sin to kill in a book. But for the author, its the most grievous thing to ever be done. To the audience, you are killing a person, but in your head, you are killing off one of your children. Do not hate upon an author for killing off one of their characters, grieve with them instead."
