I killed Draco at the end of 400k+ words, with absolutely no warning, right after Harry defeated Voldemort /and/ avoided getting dragged to hell. Given that it's a H/D fic where Harry's love was what gave him the mental strength to overpower Voldemort's possession of him, the reaction was about what you'd expect.

Of course, by that point, there was no changing how things were going and I wouldn't have anyway. I occasionally change a minor point here or there based on reviews, but nothing major because I always have my fics written in full by the time I start posting. If I let reviewer opinions change major plot points, it would lead to re-writing a whole lot of stuff and I'm not willing to do that once I've started posting.
