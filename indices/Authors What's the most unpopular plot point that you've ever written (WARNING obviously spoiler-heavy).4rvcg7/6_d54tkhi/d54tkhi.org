For several years, I wrote scripts, some of which are now being made into movies. Therefore, characters will not be named, and a lawsuit will be avoided! lol

I once wrote a heroine who killed herself at the end. Now, it was not the end of the movie, nor was it a noble cause, but everyone who read the script (a few hundred people max) hated it. they asked why. they asked what was the point. Yet the point was included in the end of the film. during the credits. When there was a shot of her funeral.. where her desire for the entirety of the work is shown. She unified all the people. She did it via pain... but she did it.

Another plot point is one that I am currently working. My editor has expressed outrage that I am doing it, that my work will be for not, that there will be riots in the streets of my fans... and Imma be honest... I will still write it. and yes... its for a fic I am working on.
