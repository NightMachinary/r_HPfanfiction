I'm not an author (at least I've never posted anything I've written lol) but for what it's worth, I write for myself, not other people. If/when I decide to post something, I would take constructive criticism seriously, but I wouldn't re-write an entire plot point just because some people don't like it. And as a reader, I can say that I've never stopped reading a story because of a plot twist that I didn't like.
