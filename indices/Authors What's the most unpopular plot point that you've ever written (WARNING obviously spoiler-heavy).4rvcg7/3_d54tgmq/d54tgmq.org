In one of my stories, one of the protags is raped offscreen. Judging by chapter page hits, I lose about 25% of readers here and I probably have more negative reviews for this one scene than anything else I've written. Were I to write this story again, knowing what I know now, I'd find another way to do what I wanted with the scene.

Stylistically, I've written many stories in third-person present tense, which loses me lots of readers.
