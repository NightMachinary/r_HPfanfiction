I literally cheered in my seat and woke up my poor sleeping cat when I saw the next story up was Turn, as it is definitely one of my favorites. I was planning on re-reading it soon anyway and now I have the perfect reason to do so! Thanks, [[/u/denarii]]!

Also for recs, is there any specific criteria you look for in the stories you pick for the Book Club?
