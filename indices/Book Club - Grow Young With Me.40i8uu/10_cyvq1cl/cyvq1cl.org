Okay, first book club entry I've stuck with (almost). I really like the kids and the older character scenes as standalones. They've definitely grown up. I don't think this is spoiling, but the scene with the microwave and Ron is classic, got me laughing. I could easily return to this and read a single chapter on its own if I'm in the mood for a fast fanfic fix.

The timing's a little off from canon, which threw me off a little but then again that's not the most dramatic change so not really a biggie. I feel like there's a lot of dialogue and inner thoughts, which is fine and well-written in a vacuum, but so much makes it really off balance for me.

Abby reads like a pleasant weirdo. Sort of like a watered down less-whimsical muggle-quirky Luna. She's a good OC.

My biggest gripe is the length. Now I love a short fic, which I'm thinking is probably not the general fanfic reader's preference, and this fic is a little too sprawl-y for me.

I really dislike that there's very little magic in this. Maybe I've scrolled past it (an indication of it getting too long for me), but I'm pretty sure there are entire chapters with no mention of wands and spells, and if it is there are times when it's minor or just in passing (floo, herbology properties of plants, Harry sitting at his desk playing with his wand while bored - yes, yes, I know).
