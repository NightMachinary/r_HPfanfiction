  My biggest gripe is the length. Now I love a short fic, which I'm thinking is probably not the general fanfic reader's preference, and this fic is a little too sprawl-y for me.

Yeah, YMMV. I prefer longer fics.

  I really dislike that there's very little magic in this.

Personally, I find that a nice break. I like a character-focused slice of life fic that doesn't feel the need to focus on [[http://i.imgur.com/YsbKHg1.gif][magic]] and saving the +world+ +Britain+ magical Britain. 99% of fics do that to a greater or lesser degree. In fact I think it would be weird if the author tried to constantly call attention to [[http://i.imgur.com/YsbKHg1.gif][magic]]. The story is about characters as adults going about their lives. They're no longer in school learning about magic. Magic is just another part of normal life for them now.
