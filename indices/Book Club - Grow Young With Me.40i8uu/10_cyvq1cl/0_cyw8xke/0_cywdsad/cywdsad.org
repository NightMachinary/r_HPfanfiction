Precisely because magic is another part of normal life for them is why I find the absence jarring. I don't mean grand spell-waving which saves the world and turning buttons into dragons, but stuff that was present in the series as more run-of-the-mill use. Mrs. Weasley uses a lot of household charms in the books introducing us to the concept of quotidian magic. The characters can refill a drink, float objects behind them, I mean Harry's first instinct in one chapter is to go walk to get his son a soft toy, and only summons it after the kid is basically in tears about him leaving the room.

That GIF represents the world I'd like to live in. And yes, I am short fic crazy. It's rare that I stay with a fic over 200k words.
