I hear what you're saying, but at this point in his life he's been in the wizarding world more than the muggle one, and as an Auror. Regardless, I don't think the author was consciously using it as a character trait or instinct, since none of the other characters seem to be waving their wands around either. It's an overall story choice which I did not like.
