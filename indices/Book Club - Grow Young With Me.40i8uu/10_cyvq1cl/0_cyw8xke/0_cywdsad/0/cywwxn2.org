  I mean Harry's first instinct in one chapter is to go walk to get his son a soft toy, and only summons it after the kid is basically in tears about him leaving the room.

Yeah, though Harry was raised as a muggle. Even though magic's become normal for him, his first instinct for simple tasks may still be to do them without magic. Like.. if I could use magic.. after a while when it became normal for me I'd probably end up leaving my wand lying on a table all the time and such.
