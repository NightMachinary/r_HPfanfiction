I just read this over the weekend and really enjoyed it. I found the characterizations of Harry and the rest of the adults really well done. It was a light and fun read, although it touches on some heavier topics and Ginny's death broke my heart.

The author doesn't seem to have a good grip on the ages / dates that the story takes place. I write a lot of next-gen so it stood out to me that Teddy, James, Albus and Lily are much older than they should be in 2009. For Albus and Rose to go to school in 2017, they would have been born c. 2006 and Lily and Hugo would be born about two years later. Ginny, in this story, died in November 2006. In 2009, Teddy should be 11, Lily should be 1(ish), Albus should be 3(ish) and James should be 4/5. If the author were to say the birthdates were AU for Harrry's kids it would be fine, but Teddy still shouldn't be 13.
