This is so different than what I normally read. I am strongly /not/ a Harry/Ginny shipper and I really never read fics with major OCs. But this is great. It stomped on my heart repeatedly, but I still felt hopeful. And I felt like the family dynamic was realistic. The kids still act out and Harry still responds like a parent.

This is also the best I've liked something that references a positive Harry/Ginny relationship in a long time. I stopped reading that pairing years ago, and now I normally can't stand it, but this time, even though it is only peripheral, I really felt it and actually believed it.
