I enjoyed it because it's well-written, relaxing, and "heartwarming", but it definitely moves a bit slow... If some of the plot threads hovering in the background (Abby's questionable past, innocent man in jail) connect soon then I bet it will become VERY good. I'm looking forward to that. It would be cool to see a fic that goes from sappy love story to mystery/action, rather than the other way around.
