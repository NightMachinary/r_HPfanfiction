This is very much not my type of fanfic. It is pure fluff with a seeming self-insert OC. While I do enjoy a fluff piece now and then, there is usually at least /something/ else going on with it. In this story there's just a very slow progression of romance.

For instance Hope (jeconias), while also a mainly fluff/romance piece, there are other relevant plot pieces occurring like the big Quidditch tournament. In this fic there is a nebulous case which may or may not have some importance and Abby's checkered past or abusive boyfriend/husband. But if something hasn't developed in over 100k+ words, I'm not sure if it ever will or even if I'd want it to.

Preferences aside, it is well written, and the character interaction seems spot on. The pacing is off, but that's the only real complaint I have.
