I /almost/ had the same gripe about the lack of magic as others, but it started to pick up. For me, a Harry Potter story without magic isn't really a Harry Potter story. You can write a romance without needing to use someone else's characters. In this case, we started to get glimpses of the auror office, some accidental magic, etc, which fixed the problem.

I really enjoyed the story. There are a few issues - Ginny's incident (trying to avoid spoilers) seemed a little contrived, for instance - but I can get past those and just enjoy it. The canon adults are done very well - aged up perfectly. Some else already mentioned the scene with Ron and the microwave, and that one tickled me too. I even liked Molly, and that's very rare for me.

The children were done well too. I thought some of their dialogue was a little too old for them, but for the most part it was cute and seemed real.

As for Abby, she can occasionally seem a little too ditzy for I get the impression that's a kind of defense mechanism. When we've seen her thoughts they've been a lot more grounded.

I see a few comments on length. A story should be long enough to finish: no more, no less. Sometimes I read stuff hat has endless descriptions of characters walking around, musing about pointless stuff and only really trying to boost the word count. On the other hand, there are stories where the characters would be replaced by Lego characters for all the characterisation they have. This story has to fill us in on a tragic event, let us know what's happened since, introduce a new character and make us care about them... and then have a plot of its own. I think it's paced just about right. But then I always have a soft spot for slower stories - Vitam Paramus is a particular favourite.

I've added it to my follow list, and I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what happens.
