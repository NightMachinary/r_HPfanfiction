Love this fic. I think Abby is one of the best OCs I've read and I'm really excited to learn more about her character. I think Harry, Ron and Hermione have been aged properly without distorting their characters, and their interactions have been true to this. The relationship forming between Abby and Harry feels organic and real and hasn't been rushed. I think the timeline isn't very well established. I don't have the quotes but I'm pretty sure the fic begins in March and as some point its mentioned they've known each other 4 months and at that point it was May-ish.

My only real complaint is the kids are a bit too perfect. Losing a parent can certainly make kids grow up faster, and be more likely to respond to their remaining parents, but I think one scene where Harry has to yell at them for not listening would dispel this worry.

Also a bit concerned about the auror case that keeps getting brought up. It seems likely it will somehow tie into Ginny's death, which I think would be unfortunate. It's much better that she just died because of shit luck than something malicious. Also Tracey Davis is well done.
