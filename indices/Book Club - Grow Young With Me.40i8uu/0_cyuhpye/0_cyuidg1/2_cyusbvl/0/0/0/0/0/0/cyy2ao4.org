Lol. I like our theorys, they feel solid.

I use the reddit is fun app and spoiler tags show up correctly in it (blacked out text, underlined if you tap it). Yours showed up as a hyperlink on the word "spoiler", with the address something like this:

%I%am%a%very%hard%to%read%fake%spoiler%

Ah the joys of different methods to view reddit not playing nicely
