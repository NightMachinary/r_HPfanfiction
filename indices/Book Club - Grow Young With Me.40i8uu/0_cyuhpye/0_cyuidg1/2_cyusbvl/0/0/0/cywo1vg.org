I think it could go either way. But I read this part from the recent ch. 20 to be foreshadowing [[/Ryan's%20was%20this%20plastic%20little%20thing.%20Chipped%20all%20over%20the%20place%20until%20he%20finally%20managed%20to%20break%20it%20clean%20in%20half.%22%20She%20sniffed%20in%20amusement.][spoiler]] Now call me paranoid but that sounds like an obliviation to me. Maybe [[/her%20brother%20was%20a%20muggleborn%20whose%20wand%20was%20snapped.%20She%20says%20he%20'gave%20up'%20after%20his%20wand%20broke.%20His%20hobby%20of%20doing%20*magic%20tricks*%20sounds%20like%20an%20obliviator's%20way%20to%20cover%20up%20his%20sister's%20memories.%20He%20is%20also%20described%20as%20very%20distant%20now.%20I%20bet%20exiled%20muggleborns%20have%20all%20sorts%20of%20issues%20fitting%20back%20into%20muggle%20society][spoiler]] Maybe I'm wrong? But it sounds intriguing.

 

EDIT: fixed the spoiler formatting, it's a pain
