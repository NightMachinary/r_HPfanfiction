First off, I'm on mobile and whatever your trying with the spoilers is not working well for me.

Secondly, I didn't catch the bit about [[/spoiler][his wand being broken clean in half]] on my read through, but that leads even heavier weight to your [[/spoiler][muggleborn brother]] theory. It has obliviation written all over it!

It could lead into the case too. [[/spoiler][Perhaps a Muggleborn brother would give the auror force a reason to be involved in the investigation of family crimes? Maybe the wife/son murder was a outsiders attack on a muggleborn family?]] obviously rampant speculation is going on here :P
