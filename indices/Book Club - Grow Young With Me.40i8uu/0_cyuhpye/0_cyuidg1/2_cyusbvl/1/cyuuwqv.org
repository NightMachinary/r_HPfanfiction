I haven't read those parts for a while (I started reading it about 3 months ago now), but that's just what my gut was telling me. We know there's something in Abby's past that the author hasn't revealed yet, so there's a possibility that subplot Will merge to the main plot through her past.

To me, it's pretty obvious the 2 plotlines will meet up, either in some way facilitating or hurting Abby and Harry's blossoming relationship, or to give a reason to tell Abby about the wizarding world (perhaps with the threat of obliviation included, if the investigation goes through her.)
