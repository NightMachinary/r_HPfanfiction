There is something about the way the words were woven in this one that is both brilliant and rare. Say what you want about how plain the plot is and you would be right, but that's just one cog in the wheel. When I started reading it about 8 months ago I basically stumbled upon it and had no expectations from the story, what I needed was to really take my mind off things. And in those bittersweet words and in those brilliant kids there was such a 'feel good' vibe that was instantly uplifting and I have been enamoured with this one ever since. But then again it's easy to see how it might not be what one seeks in a fanfiction.
