It wasn't the most comprehensive of comments, but he did participate in the discussion by sharing his opinion. It actually opened the discussion more- I wouldn't have commented otherwise because of the reception this story has. If he had said a positive one-liner, it would have been upvoted. Look at [[/u/inquisitorcoc]] 's comment sitting at +3 or so

I don't think there's anything wrong with either comment. Having a dissenting opinion enriches the discussion and adds another dimension to it.
