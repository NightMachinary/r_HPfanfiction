Lordy, looks like disliking this story makes a downvoting.

I want to be upfront that this clearly isn't the story for me. I cannot get into it at all. It's all dialogue. Abby is the clumsy, endearingly annoying, eyelash batting, only issues exist to make her cuter, sensitive fixer upper and it just sticks in my craw. The story, the writing, the characters are all insubstantial and thin to me. I can't care about the characters, the romance, or what tragedy happened to Ginny.

But, that's okay because people like different things and it's great that they've found something they enjoy.
