I avoided this story like a plague at first.

I read through the first 3 chapters and found myself wondering why so many people would rave about what seems to be an obvious self-insert fluff fic.

I put it away for a while and ignored the many recs, still wondering how it was possible this could be so well recommended.

Then, it was recommended again when I asked for a NextGen fic that didn't focus on the kids and here comes this story again. Fine. I'll read it.

The impossible happened. I started at chapter 7 and kept reading...and reading...and reading. I realized I found a strange kinship in Harry's normalcy. No dastardly dark lords. Just doing shit at work and taking care of the kids. The dialogue, while extremely saccharine at points, wasn't overbearing and the characters were extremely canon compliant.

It was nice.

Which is about all I can say about this fic now that I've got to the end. As chapters 16 to 19 rolled around, I realized why I disliked it in the first place. True, it is highly recommended as a nice "slice of life" fic.

And people are right in a way.

Life is usually as boring as this fic.
