I'm a Harry/Ginny shipper, but I love this story. It's a nice nod to the pairing, but creates something new and beautiful out of a very sad story. I almost started crying on the bus when I read the flashback chapter. Just about broke my heart. Made me think about what would happen to my SO if I should die. I would hate for him to be sad and miserable forever. The story is definitely on my favorites.
