I loved this fic... I was surprised that Abby felt so REAL... I kinda dont like the children characters tho. They just felt... artificial like they werent real. Also, a part of me feels like there should be one person who well... talked to Harry about it. Hermoine only does it during the story, three years later? that seems... bull to me.
