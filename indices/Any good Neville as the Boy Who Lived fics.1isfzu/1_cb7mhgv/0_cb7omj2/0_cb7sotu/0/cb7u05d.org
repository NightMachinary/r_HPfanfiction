I didn't say it's bad. On the contrary. I'm on chapter 9 now and it's starting to look amazing, but just in the first 6 chapters, nothing made sense and it was confusing as hell. More so that most of the character changes were unexplained.

PS: But what i hate about this Fic and have to turn my suspension of disbelief to maximum is that "Ministry drafting kids into war" premise. It's so incredibly idiotic.
