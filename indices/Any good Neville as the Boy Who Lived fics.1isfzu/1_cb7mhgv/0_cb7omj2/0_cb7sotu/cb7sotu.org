Meh. I certainly didn't intend to infuriate anyone when I posted. I would contend that any story with Neville as Boy Who Lived is bound to be an AU of some sort, so differences are to be expected, but I get that the story is not to everyone's tastes.

I'll take a break from posting in this subreddit for awhile. I'm probably spamming more links and such than is appropriate and it's not clear that my tastes in fanfiction align well with others' anyway.
