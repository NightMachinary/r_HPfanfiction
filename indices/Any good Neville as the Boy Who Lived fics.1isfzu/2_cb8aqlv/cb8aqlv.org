[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By_the_Divining_Light][By the Divining Light]] and its sequel, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5971274/1/Conlaodhs_Song][Conlaodh's Song]], are five star DLP fanfics.

They might not be what you are looking for because they are still quite Harry-centric. Basically Neville is like canon Harry "Boy Who Lived" and Harry is more like a young Albus Dumbldore or Tom Riddle.
