Often I've seen it as her whole family's policy of "We don't like or agree with Voldemort, but openly opposing him would see us all murdered, at best." It's ultimately short-sighted, as the classic "First they came for..." quote illustrates, but in many portrayals it's worked to see them through multiple previous Dark Lords.

While I certainly can't praise such a position, neither can I condemn a man for not wanting his wife and daughters brutally tortured, raped, and/or murdered.

Now a more politically-neutral position, where they're definitely opposed to Voldemort's agenda (and to legalizing Muggle-baiting or Muggle-hunting and to oppressing Muggle-born) but are working to preserve the non-bigoted parts of wix tradition (Samhain instead of Halloween, for example) can work. In such fics, Dumbledore is made somewhat antagonistic by wanting to wipe away wix culture in favor of Muggle culture because... reasons?
