If it was just a teenager not wanting to fight in a war, that would be totally fine. But it is portrayed as if both sides are right in some ways and wrong in others and is a way to say that muggleborns are stupid and lesser while purebloods are much better, but they still don't want to eradicate them. Just "re-educate" them.
