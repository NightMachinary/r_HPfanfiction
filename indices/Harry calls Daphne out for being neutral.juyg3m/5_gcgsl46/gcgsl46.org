“to refuse the givens” written by snark on ao3

has some of this. I thought it might have been the best part of the fic, but Harry ended up caving a bit and then it wasn't really discussed again if I remember correctly. Daphne also apologized and it ended up being a compromise of sorts. Decent fic, though it feels a bit like the author is having themself a wank over how well read they are. Muggle literary references coming from a pureblood heiress who doesn't really see why Harry would have a problem with her being around Bellatrix Lestrange was a bit like a cat barking to my mind.
