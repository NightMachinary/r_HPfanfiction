My main issue with the whole House Greengrass and, to an extent, "gray" Harry, is that they jerk themselves off over how much better then anyone else they are when they're very much conservative on the cultural axis. The only difference between Lucius Malfoy and Cyrus Greengrass is that one of them serves Voldemort while the other one really wants Harry to bang his daughter. (And what the hell is up with that, anyway?) They hold the same views on blood and culture, have equally inflated egos and neither really bothered to teach their children manners. Seriously, what's up with Daphne always being a worse female Draco at the start before suddenly "becoming nice"? (to Harry, she's still a massive bitch to everyone else)
