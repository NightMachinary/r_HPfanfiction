Well as we know from canon the wizarding world is filled with cowards. Voldemort and his deatheaters are heavily outnumbered but literally a dozen of them send Hundreds running away.

So all those who state they are neutral are really saying is I don't want to join the Deatheaters because I know I would be sent out to fight (where I might die). And I don't want to join the "light" because then the Deatheaters might come after me so I would have to fight (where I might die). By saying I'm neutral they should both leave me alone.
