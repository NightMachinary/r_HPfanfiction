This is a response based on your comments to other users, and the more general tropes that I've seen in any (mostly poor quality) 'Grey Wizard'/Daphne fics that I've seen.

In my mind, Wizarding Britain's non-economic politics are based on two key issues: blood and 'dark' magic. The challenge is that we don't know enough about the dark arts based on canon to see if that's a reasonable position. Common fanon expansions include family magic that the Light is against because it is not shared, 'positive' dark arts like blood and ritual magic (including the ever-present Samhain and Yule tributes to the Old Way) that are banned, or that the intent of spells matters more than their composition.

We don't really know enough about the economics of the Wizarding world in general, let alone about economic policy within the government, to make an inference on how wizards adapt to a post-scarcity economy.

Parties within the Wizengamot are obviously a fanon development, but the 'Light' and 'Dark' parties are usually made to represent and ratify the views of Dumbledore and Voldemort respectively into law. In the type of fics you're talking about, the 'Neutrals'/'Greys' are the party of stragglers that fence-sit in between the two camps.

On the one hand, you have Dumbledore: believes in equality of blood and is firmly against dark magic. This is based on canon: the Muggle Protection Act was created to root out dark artifacts from ancestral homes, and Dumbledore's rooted out most of the dark arts books in the library of Hogwarts. On the other, you have the obvious 'Dark' beliefs of the Death Eaters, who espouse purity of blood and the use of dark arts.

Most fics do a poor job on developing a coherent platform of the Neutrals. In my experience reading, it's mostly isolationism against the others and letting God sort 'em out in the war. 'Grey' wizards are usually just defined as those that are willing to use lethal force and somehow have a loose morality.

A more developed look could be that there is just a legitimate third (or even fourth) party that have real philosophical differences with the Light and Dark. For example, some may be totally blind to purity of blood, but want the ability to perform some sort of 'dark' magic. I think this actually Grindewald's politics, though his were taken to an extreme. Others could be pro-wizarding tradition^{tm .}

Canon, as a YA book, does not delve into any of this and just pits good against evil. If there was a real party, it would be fine and good to be a part of it. It would not be inherently bad to not be a part of the Order and Dumbledore's group. You can still be good and moral and fight against Voldemort.

There's also the issue to consider of the role of law enforcement. There are probably a great many people that are against Voldemort but believe that the Aurors should be the ones handling it, especially pre-coup of the Ministry. That does not make them evil either, merely self-preserving.
