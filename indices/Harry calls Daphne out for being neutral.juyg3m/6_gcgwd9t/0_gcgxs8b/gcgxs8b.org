Oh, I'm fine with neutrals as a party in the Wizengamot, but what I hate is when Daphne is basically a blood purist and thinks muggleborns are scum, but is depicted as good since she doesn't want to kill all of them. I just read a fanfic where Daphne ranted about stupid mudbloods trying to ruin wizarding culture and I'm so annoyed by how Daphne being a blood purist was never addressed.
