Oh, I'm too much of an SJW to like a fanfic like that. It reminds me too much of when a white classmate told me it's justified to call some people ni**ers, but black people like me who were smart and hard working weren't ni**ers, so I would just be thinking about that while reading that. I don't think offensive slurs like that should describe any group of people, even if it's just about the "bad" people in that group.
