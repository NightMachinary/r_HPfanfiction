I agree that offensive slurs shouldn't be used to anyone, for sure. It definitely immediately disqualifies you as a decent and intelligent person, regardless of any good points that you bring up.

The other less disparaging argument is the tourist one that I've seen Harry use on Hermione a couple of times in fanfiction. The "if you were in Japan, would you force the Japanese to adopt your cultural values? This is not muggle Britain, if you want to go 'native', learn the culture around you"

That's a much more compelling argument. and the answer you want to give is based on situation. People being oppressed should push for change, but eliminating cultural traditions just for the sake of it is more than that.
