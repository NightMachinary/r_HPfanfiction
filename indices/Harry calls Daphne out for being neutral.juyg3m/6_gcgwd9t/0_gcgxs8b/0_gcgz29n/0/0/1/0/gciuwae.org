I don't disagree with you. There is an awful lot of fridge horror that happens with really thinking about the 'whimsical' stuff that JK wrote. There's definitely stuff that is horrifying to think about.

As far as I know, the join or be obliviated, have your wand snapped and your core bound is a fanon thing, but you could tell me otherwise.

It's challenging to come up with any response other than that because a lot of things are based on the context of a fic, because the systems of government and the culture in general are so poorly developed in canon.

There are a lot of horrifying things in cultures that exist around the world today. There's recourse and ways of supporting progress and change vehemently without categorically rejecting the entire thing.
