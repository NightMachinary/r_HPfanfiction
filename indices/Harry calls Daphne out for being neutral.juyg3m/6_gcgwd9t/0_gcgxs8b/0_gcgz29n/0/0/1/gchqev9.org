Any culture that has slavery, legal love potions, the legal right to erase memories of people(muggles) without care(oh look, a wizard killed a father, let's make everyone forget and make a cover story, forensics? what's that?), tortures prisoners and has sentient beings without rights is not a culture worth respecting.

Human rights and war crimes are laws that went against the culture of many countries in the days that they were made but it was a good thing.

Magic britain doesn't have the monopoly of magic, people are born with it. The tourist argument could have some grounds if they let people decide whether they want to be a part of it or not without erasing memories. Right now is either obey our rules or we break your wand.
