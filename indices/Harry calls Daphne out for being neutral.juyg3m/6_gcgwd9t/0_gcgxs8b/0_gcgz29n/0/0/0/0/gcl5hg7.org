But who can tell what's better or worse? Your vision seems more than a bit Imperialist.

It's kind of ironic because European were known for arriving at a place and start trying to change things to fit their worldview without caring for context and ended up completely fucking things up (see Africa and some parts of Asia)

This whole idea of "they should change things because my way is better" is incredibly dangerous and the cause of many a cultural genocide throughout history.

The truth of the matter is people have free will and their own culture, and preferences, as long as they aren't hurting anyone. And if they are, then changing part should be done with extreme care, to not make things worse.

One example is Daenerys conquering cities in Slaver's Bay and just changing things without thinking of the consequences(or ignoring counse)l, the only reason it worked is because she had dragons, and even then thing got really bad real fast.

Hermione is sometimes portrayed as someone who just looks at things superficially and starts criticizing without looking for the context, this is bad, and yes, authors change things up to make it worse, but sometimes it's used for character development.
