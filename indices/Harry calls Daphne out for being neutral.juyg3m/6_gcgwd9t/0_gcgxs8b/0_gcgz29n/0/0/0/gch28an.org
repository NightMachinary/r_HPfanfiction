Don't we adopt each other's philosophies a lot of the time though? I honestly think someone's view on that hinges on an individual's ideology. I think traditions should be changed, and I would advocate for it even if I was an immigrant. There's a lot of unhealthy values that the Japanese (for example, they prioritize work over their lives) have that I think should be changed even if they seem harmless, so I don't think that argument would work on me.
