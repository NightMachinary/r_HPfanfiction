I am not saying it shouldn't be changed, but that the process of changing is not as simple as just complaining about it and telling them how bad/stupid/illogical it is and/or just making it illegal(as some depictions of Hermione do) that's just asking for trouble.

Japan's work culture is somewhat unhealthy(even if they normalized sleeping on the job) but as you said, they themselves are changing it.

Same thing could be said about the anti-social behaviors of some of their population.

Bringing it to HP, I think about how bullheaded Hermione was with the House Elves, she didn't talk with them, she didn't ask their situation, and how they felt. She saw something she didn't like and immediately tried to change it with little study.

Where would the House-Elves go? What would they do? Would they be happy? What forms of employement they could find out of Hogwarts?

They may be sentient, but their psychology is very different from a human's, even in canon you can see that.

It always reminds me of that scene where Daenerys frees ALL the slaves and one old man comes to ask to return to his old family because he was respected there and liked living there(he was treated like a teacher and family friend to the kids).

Blanket, generalized actions with little analysis have been shown again and again to only make things worse in the majority of the time. One of the exceptions would be US slavery because the conditions were much, much different than even slavery in GoT(in some aspects).
