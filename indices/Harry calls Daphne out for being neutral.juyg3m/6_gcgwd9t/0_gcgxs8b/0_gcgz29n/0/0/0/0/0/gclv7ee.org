I do think my view on the world is a bit weird, but I don't automatically assume that my way is better. I just think that every country, including my own, has flaws and attributes that can be fixed by bringing ideas from other countries. If we're talking about Japan, their culture of valuing hard work over everything else negatively impacts their people. They are expected to never take time off of work and have extremely long work hours. They have even have a name for death from overwork. The idea that every culture is perfect is a bit flawed IMO. Sure, we shouldn't change their culture if it's not hurting anybody, but some parts of it are hurting their people. The younger people in Japan have also noticed the problem and want to change it since they don't want their whole lives to be spent working all the time.
