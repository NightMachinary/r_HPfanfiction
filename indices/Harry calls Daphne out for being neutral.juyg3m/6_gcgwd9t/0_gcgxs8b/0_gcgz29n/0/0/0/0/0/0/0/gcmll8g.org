But one of the reasons younger Japanese people don't like the work culture Japan has is because they were exposed to how other cultures did it. Of course I agree that change won't happen by forcing it to happen, but someone has to expose the people to those new ideas. With House Elves, I think they needed to be slowly taught what freedom is and how to embrace it. I think their psychology is different, but a large part of it is brainwashing. In the US, many people actually thought similar things about black people, because they never rebelled. Hell, the people who punished the slaves for stepping out of line were literally also slaves. Even when stretching the definition of a rebellion, and making it so that every revolt that had more than 9 people (white or black) participating, there were only around 30 revolts in total, and even the few "major" ones had around 50 people at most. They were enslaved for 260 years, and an 1860 census reported there were 4.5 million slaves, which shows that they were, for the most part, not fighting back. After the Nat Turner rebellion (probably the largest slave rebellion ever in the US), a Virginia legislator assured his people that Turner and his allies were just outliers and that their slave population "is not only a happy one, but is a contented, peaceful and harmless one‚Äù.

Many slaves in the US loved their masters and actually stayed with them after they were freed. Also, regarding Hermione, I think she was right, even though she went about it the wrong way. Brainwashed slaves aren't reasonable and you can't listen to them, since they'll just parrot that they love their work and their masters. John Brown thought he could convince them to fight against their masters, but he was wrong, and he payed for his actions with his life.
