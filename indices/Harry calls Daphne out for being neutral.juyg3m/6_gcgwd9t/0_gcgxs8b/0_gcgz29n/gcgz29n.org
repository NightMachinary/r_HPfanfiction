It depends on the quality of writing and the context for me to make my opinion on that.

I read an interesting fic that differentiated mudbloods from other muggle-borns. The author had taken the time to establish a nuanced culture, with societal, quasi-religious, and political structure that was different than the Muggle world.

The argument was that 'blood-traitors and mudbloods' were totally against adhering to anything within the culture of the author's wizarding Britain and tried to enforce Muggle standards on every aspect of life in the wizarding world.

Neville was actually the character that called Hermione a mudblood (privately to Harry and only after a long argument) because she was so adamant about making the wizarding world more like the muggle one. He was progressive in terms of most issues and wasn't a blood purist, just believed that their culture needed to be respected.

It depends on how the argument is framed really and what the context was before it.

For example, you could have a situation like the Native Americans who are trying to stop the eroding of a rich history that's unlike the newer European culture that surrounds it. Or you could have a situation where people in privilege are desperately trying to keep the systems that perpetuate systematically grind down those in a less privileged position.
