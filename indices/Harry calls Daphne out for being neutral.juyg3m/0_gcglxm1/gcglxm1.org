Sometimes neutrality is portrayed in the context of the Wizengamots which I don't think is too terrible. But trying to claim neutrality against Voldemort (who is clearly a psycho) is like ðŸ¤®. Just make Daphne say she is against it, but is powerless to do anything.

Though, all in all, I still enjoy haphne and will eat up anything well written regardless if it has some tropes that annoy me.
