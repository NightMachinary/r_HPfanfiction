In general it annoys me how Harry is the one who has to change over Daphne, because Harry always does what is right no matter the odds or consequences. But I think its cause most stories are told through Harry's POV and they need him to go through a character arc.

Its easy to complain about logic and plot holes when your the reader, but when writing a story its really hard to make things fit the way you want.
