I guess that's why every American has health care.... oh, nope.

Or at least 1 out of 6 American children doesn't go hungry.... wait, can't say that.

Well, certainly we didn't lock up an entire generation of black men for minor drug possession... jeez, Biden /wrote/ the Crime Bill!

Remind me again what centrists have done? Well, they joined Republicans to fight illegal wars, massively increase the defense budget, hand trillions to Wall Street, send millions of good jobs to the Third World, created actual slave trading in Libya, and provided almost no stimulus relief in the worst pandemic in a century.

But don't worry, you can go back to brunch while the rest of us line up at food banks and ration our insulin. I'm sure the cops will roust all of the homeless people from your doorstep before you have to step over them.
