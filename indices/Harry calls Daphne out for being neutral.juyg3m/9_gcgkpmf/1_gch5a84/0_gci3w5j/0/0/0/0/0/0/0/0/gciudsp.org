Glad you at least learned something then. Maybe that means the next time the Dems control Congress & the White House, instead of excluding tens of millions of Americans from health care to protect the insurance industry, they'll actually provide it to everyone.

But let's be real, you still don't care about the lives or needs of other people so long as the conservatives in charge have a "D" after their name instead of an "R".
