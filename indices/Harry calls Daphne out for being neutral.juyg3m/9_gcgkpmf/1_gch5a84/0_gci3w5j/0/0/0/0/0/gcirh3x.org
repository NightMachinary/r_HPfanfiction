Lmao you're ridiculous and have no idea what you're talking about. Bernie never had a plan to get anything passed. He just said "revolution" and some nonsense about protesting Mitch McConnell (as if that would work or he couldn't do that now).

Presidents don't just wave magic wands, much less VPs.

Maybe learn how government works and you'll see why Bernie hasn't gotten anything done but rename post offices. If that's pushing to help people then he clearly does a terrible job. He's helped no one
