Lmao it's not like Bernie got us healthcare. Obama expanded healthcare access to 30 million more people than Bernie did.

Bernie hasn't fed anyone. His own campaign staff had to sue his campaign just so they could unionize after he refused to pay $15/hour

Bernie voted for the crime bill and even campaigned on it and how he's "tough on crime" in 2006.

Bernie is a joke. Sorry you're gullible enough to fall for his grift.
