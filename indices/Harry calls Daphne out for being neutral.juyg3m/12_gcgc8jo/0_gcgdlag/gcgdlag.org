I'm not saying she has to fight, but it gets annoying when she acts like the neutral faction is the best while the other factions are too "radical". When one side wants to wipe the world clean of the impure and the other side is protecting them, you should be supporting the side that's protecting them. She shouldn't act like it's stupid to support either side when one side is clearly evil and the other is fighting against that evil.
