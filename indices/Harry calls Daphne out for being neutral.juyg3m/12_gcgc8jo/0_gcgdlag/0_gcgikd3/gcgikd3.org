I hear ya. It's rather like that quote; "the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing".

Some people can't afford neutrality, like you say. The only ones who can say neutrality is the best option is those who have the privilege to allow it. Ergo: purebloods. I would love to read a story where she's confronted with the reality of what it means to stand for nothing when people are suffering and dying. That's what her neutrality would contribute to while she sits safe, not a better world.
