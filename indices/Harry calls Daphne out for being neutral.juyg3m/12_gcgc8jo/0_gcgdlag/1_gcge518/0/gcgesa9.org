Wizarding Britain isn't like Nazi Germany though. Voldemort couldn't kill everyone who doesn't believe in blood purity, since there weren't many Death Eaters and a large portion of their soldiers were non-humans. He was quite willing to spare purebloods if they gave up on fighting him. Also, for a large portion of the books, Voldemort isn't widely known to be alive, so there's no reason to still worry since most think he died more than a decade ago.
