"Goddamn it, Snape, you can't die to Lupin - I need to ritually murder you next week!"

"What was that?"

"I said... your arrogance is reaching its peak."

I imagine you could get some mileage out of a humor fic in which James tries to kill Snape once every other week, while protecting him from horrible disasters the rest of the time. Snape assumes he's behind those problems, but doesn't realize the Wile E. Coyote-style deathtraps he accidentally walks through. I mean, the kid apparently did extensive Potions research before his sixth year, which Hermione notes is quite dangerous. Surely someone pulled his bacon out of the fire once or twice.
