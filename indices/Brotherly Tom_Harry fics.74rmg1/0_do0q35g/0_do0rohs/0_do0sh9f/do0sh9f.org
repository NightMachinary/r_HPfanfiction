Okay, most of those aren't actively slash or slash at all -- in fact, I'd say the only fic really focused on slash of the lot is Rebirth, but it /is/ by Athey, after all.

Twist of Fate says it's slash, but it doesn't really come into play until later on (and considering that it's 700k words long, that's a lot of /later/). Honestly, I reckon that for most of those 700k words, you could skip the actively slash parts and come out none the wiser.

Old Souls & Chocolate Frogs and Time Turners aren't slash.

Fire Born isn't slash (technically, by the virtue of fem!HP), & does focus on their relationship in the orphanage; the fic overall is kind of trite, but whatever.

In Wonderland is slash, but it's only really evident in the prologue -- though I guess it isn't two parseltongue orphans at Hogwarts; adoptive big brother and a little brother is more accurate, for the most part.

Rewritten is more brotherly/generally familial than slash, for the most part.

Rebirth is blatantly slash -- and, quite frankly, the exception out of the list -- but still focuses on a more brotherly relationship early on.
