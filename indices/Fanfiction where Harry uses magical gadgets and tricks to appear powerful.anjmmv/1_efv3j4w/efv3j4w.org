Linkffn(What would Slytherin Harry do by Bid D on a Diet)

This Harry acknowledges the fact that he is not that powerful magically and uses tricks to make him look powerful. Saying anything further would give away the plot.

And in case you don't mind a long fic (around 250k words), there is linkffn(The many deaths of Harry Potter by ShayneT) which has Harry using tricks whenever fight scenes arise.
