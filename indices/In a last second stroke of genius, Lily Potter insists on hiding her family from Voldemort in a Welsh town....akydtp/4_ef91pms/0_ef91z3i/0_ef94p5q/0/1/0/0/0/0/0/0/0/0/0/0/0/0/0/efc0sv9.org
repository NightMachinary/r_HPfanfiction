  But the only distinction between a threat and an offer is defined morally. It's completely based upon the idea of what kind of behavior is considered normal and morally acceptable.

Come on, you know this is easy to look up. From Oxford:

Threat

#+begin_quote
  A statement of an intention to inflict pain, injury, damage, or other hostile action on someone in retribution for something done or not done.
#+end_quote

So no, the definition of a threat is not defined in moral terms. It's just that threats are deemed to be immoral.

  Well, not exactly. For example Voldemort could argue that might makes right and since Voldemort is more powerful and you can't defend yourself it's only natural for him to torture you. Thus, he's not actually coercing you, he is just offering you the privilege of not being tortured anymore (despite being weaker) against the secret in a mutually beneficial business transaction.
#+end_quote

That is literally a threat. All you're doing is saying Voldemort believes he has a justification for threatening a Secret Keeper. That doesn't make it not a threat, what are you talking about? It has nothing to do with solving an ethical dilemma because the charm isn't checking "Is this person good/doing a moral act?" It's checking "Did the keeper give the information voluntarily, i.e. not with the threat or use of force or violence, to the recipient?" None of this is relevant.

And yes, it did contradict what you said. Rowling said that the secret must be given entirely voluntarily, not as a result of removing free will or because of bodily harm.
