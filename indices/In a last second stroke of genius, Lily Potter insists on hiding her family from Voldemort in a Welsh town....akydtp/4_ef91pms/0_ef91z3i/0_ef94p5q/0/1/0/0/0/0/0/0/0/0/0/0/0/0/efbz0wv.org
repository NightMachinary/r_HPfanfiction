#+begin_quote
  The definitional difference between coercion and persuasion is not a moral distinction. Yes coercion is immoral but what distinguishes coercion is the use of threats and violence to change the mind or the action. These terms are not defined morally.
#+end_quote

But the only distinction between a threat and an offer is defined morally. It's completely based upon the idea of what kind of behavior is considered normal and morally acceptable.

If Voldemort tries to torture some Fidelius secret out of you, that's definitively coercion, and thus you couldn't betray the secret, right?

Well, not exactly. For example Voldemort could argue that might makes right and since Voldemort is more powerful and you can't defend yourself it's only natural for him to torture you. Thus, he's not actually coercing you, he is just offering you the privilege of not being tortured anymore (despite being weaker) against the secret in a mutually beneficial business transaction.

Sounds fucked up? Well it is, but the chain of reasoning is completely valid unless you manage to refute "might makes right" at it's core and I seriously doubt a simple charm is smart enough to solve complex ethical dilemmas like that.

Besides, your quote doesn't contradict my interpretation and at no point states that the secret keeper cannot be coerced by any means.
