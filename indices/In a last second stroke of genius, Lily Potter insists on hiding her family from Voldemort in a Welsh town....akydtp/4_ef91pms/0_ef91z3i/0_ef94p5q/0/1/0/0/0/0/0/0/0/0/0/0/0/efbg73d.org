The definitional difference between coercion and persuasion is not a moral distinction. Yes coercion is immoral but what distinguishes coercion is the use of threats and violence to change the mind or the action. These terms are not defined morally, even if they happen to be possibly moral in one case and definitely immoral in the other.

I didn't say or imply the charm can tell moral acts from immoral ones, what it does -both according to the books and the author - is tell if the person willingly gave up the secret or performed an act that imply's willingness.

I mean let's just clear this up and quote JKR directly:

  The Fidelius Charm is not without its weaknesses. If the Secret Keeper wishes to do so, they may divulge the information at any time (although the secret cannot be forced, bewitched or tortured out of a Secret Keeper who does not wish to give up their secret; it must be given voluntarily). [...] In spite of the fact that the secret can only be given up voluntarily, many have been subjected to the Imperius and Cruciatus Curses in an effort to make them share their information.

The user cannot be coerced by any means into giving it up.
