  Willing means that for the person in question the positive consequences outweigh the negative consequences of doing something.

That is absolutely false and not how anyone defines what "willing" means. It refers to whether or not they performed some action under their own free will, that is, without coercion by some other person to force some act independent of what that person wanted otherwise. This is just a basic legal understanding, but even in colloquial speech this is how the term is used. No one sees a person who has another person pointing their gun at their head and says "The victim is acting completely under their own will" (although in law, duress does not allow one to act with impugnity). They would say that person is being coerced, they are not acting freely. Torture is of this sort but at the furthest extreme, it's pyschological harm or direct physical damage being done. People are unable to weigh consequences at that point as you mention in your definition of "willing", at that point they are just having snap reactions in an attempt to stop the pain, i.e. coerced.

It's pretty clear things go awry at 4. 3. is bad but it's not Alice directly doing some coercive action, so while it may be immoral it's not as immoral. And I think anyone looking for hard boundaries is usually missing the point anyway. Your definition of willingness doesn't make sense.
