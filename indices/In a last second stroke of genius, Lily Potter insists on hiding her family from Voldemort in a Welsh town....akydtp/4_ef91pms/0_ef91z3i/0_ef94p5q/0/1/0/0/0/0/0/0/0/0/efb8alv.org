From a legal point of view the only difference between persuasion and coercion is that the latter is a form of persuasion that breaks the law.

If some big company legally buys up someone's debt and then legally uses it to put pressure on him until he is willing to sell his house to them that's not considered coercion even though pretty much everyone would agree that it's a shitty and morally wrong thing to do.

Unless you're suggesting the Fidelius can distinguish between moral and immoral actions, or read British Wizzarding Law, there is no way it could distinguish between persuasion and coercion.

And like, what if Bob really doesn't care that much about the weapon anyway (because to him it was mostly a collector's piece) and definitively isn't willing to die for it, do you really think the Fidelius would force him to die for the secret, even though he'd happily give it up to save his life?
