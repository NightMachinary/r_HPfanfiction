You make some good arguments for why torture is immoral and also dumb, arguments that I completely agree with.

However, if the charm was able to tell the difference between a morally and an immorally given secret then Pettigrew would have never been able to betray the Potters.

The charm obviously doesn't know right from wrong and since by your definition the difference between coercion and persuasion is that one is morally wrong it thus has no basis to tell them apart either.

I always saw JKR's quote as a matter of the secret keeper needing to have a clear mind to give on the secret.

That way if someone currently is or very recently was under cruciatus he can't give on the secret because at that moment his judgment is clouded by the pain, however if he is left to recover and then decides the secret isn't worth getting tortured again it would be his own free will, even if the torturer was using illegal and immoral means to influence that opinion.
