Um no. What I'm saying is torture can get you anything and often nothing. The Guantanamo example isn't even arguable. Massive program, extensive use of torture, information given, turned out to be falsehoods. Iraq didn't attack us, information received said it did. More to the point, Khalid Muhammed was most likely tortured more than anyone else present, we recorded more than 180 torture sessions. Yielded nothing true.

So yes, torture "works" if by "works" you just mean "Sometimes they might give you something, maybe, but the truth of it is just as up in the air as before".
