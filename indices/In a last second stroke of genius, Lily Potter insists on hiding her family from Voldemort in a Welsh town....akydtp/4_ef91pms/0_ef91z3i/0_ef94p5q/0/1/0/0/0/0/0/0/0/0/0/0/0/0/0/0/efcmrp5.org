Someone lent you money. You signed a contract to pay it back within a month with your car as mortgage. Now the month is over but you can't pay him back. However, for a concession he is willing to wait another month.

Depending on your perspective you might argue that this person is threatening to take your car unless you do what he wants, or you might argue that it's not a threat since you agreed to this very thing a month back and that he is merely offering you a deal to extend your debt if you do something in return.

Threat is "If you do this I'll not do something bad", offer is "If you do this I'll do something good", however the difference between "doing something good" and "not doing something bad" can be fluid.

Remember my dragon example (4.)? Going by your Oxford definition that would not be a threat. Alice might have set the dragon loose on Bob, but she is not stating any intentions to hurt him unless he gives her the secret, she is just telling him she won't be able to save him without it.

  And yes, it did contradict what you said. Rowling said that the secret must be given entirely voluntarily, not as a result of removing free will or because of bodily harm.

I still think you're using a very loose definition of free will. Free will just means that your mind isn't influenced by any drugs, spells or other form of direct control, not that you necessarily have to like the decision you end up making.

If someone offers you money to tell the secret and you decide to accept, that's obviously a decision made in free will. You simply decide that the money is worth more than keeping the secret.

If someone offers you to save your kids from a third party if you tell the secret and you decide to accept, that's also free will. The situation is quite a bit more shitty but no one is affecting your mind and if you decide the secret is worth more than the lives of your kids that's your own decision.

If someone offers you to save your kids from a threat that he himself created if you tell the secret and you decide to accept, that's still free will. In this case you're clearly being blackmailed but just because you don't like the options you're being given doesn't mean the choice between those options is any less of your free will.
