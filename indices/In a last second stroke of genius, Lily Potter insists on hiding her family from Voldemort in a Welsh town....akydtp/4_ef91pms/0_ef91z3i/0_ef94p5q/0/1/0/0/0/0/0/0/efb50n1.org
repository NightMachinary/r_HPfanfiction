Willing means that for the person in question the positive consequences outweigh the negative consequences of doing something. In case of successful torture for the prisoner the positive consequence of not getting tortured anymore outweigh the negative consequence of telling the secret. He thus willingly betrays the secret even though he would have been unwilling otherwise.

Like, where would you draw the boundary between willing and unwilling?

Imagine the following situation: The secret under Fidelius is some kind of powerful legendary weapon. Alice wants the weapon, Bob is the secret keeper and he normally wouldn't give it to her. However, in our case Bob is willing to give up the secret because:

1. Without the weapon Alice couldn't save Bob from a dragon that will otherwise definitively eat him.

2. Without the weapon Alice is unwilling to risk fighting the dragon even though she probably could to it without it.

3. Without the weapon Alice won't save Bob from the dragon even though she definitively could.

4. Without the weapon Alice couldn't save Bob and he'll definitively will get eaten, but Alice was the one let it loose in the first place for that very purpose.

5. Without the weapon Alice is unwilling to risk fighting the dragon even though she probably could to it without it, and she was the one who let it loose.

6. Without the weapon Alice won't save Bob from the dragon even though she definitively could, and she was the one who let it loose.

7. Without the weapon Alice will let the dragon loose to eat him.

I'd say that in (1.) the information was definitively given willingly and in (7.) definitively under duress and thus by your definition unwillingly. However, there isn't really any hard boundary between those two extremes because in the end in every case Bob always considers his survival to be worth more than keeping the weapon to himself.
