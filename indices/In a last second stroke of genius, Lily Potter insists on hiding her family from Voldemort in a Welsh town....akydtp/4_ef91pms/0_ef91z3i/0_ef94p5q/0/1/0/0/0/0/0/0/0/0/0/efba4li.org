The colloquial understanding of persuasion is a non threatening attempt to convince someone of something. How you can compare this to coercion, where the threat or the act itself are definitionally present, is beyond me. This would be like credulously arguing "Legally speaking, the only difference between a legal action and an illegal one is that illegal actions are acts you can be punished for. Why does anyone think illegals acts are against the law?"

The example you gave is considered coercion. Whether or not that specific kind of coercion is illegal seems relevant. A buff guy can coerce people into walking away by getting up in their face, but that alone probably isn't going to get him into a courtroom. Torture is usually illegal for an obvious reason (ignoring its own apparent inefficacy): We don't want to government capturing people and using direct violence because those people haven't been put into a court of law, where good evidence is required as opposed to the tortured person saying anything to make the pain stop.

Take a real world example, Guantanamo Bay. Lots of torture used, with some individual people being tortured literally hundreds of times (Khalid Muhammed). Not only did he not succumb to it, but the information we did get turned out to be false. Iraq had nothing to do with the attacks on 9/11 despite some tortured people saying it. It even turned out that a substantial number of people there were innocent of even being in any terrorist group at all, because the government got these people directly from the hands of repressive Middle Eastern governments who were asked by the U.S. to be given Al Qaeda. Of course they ended up just handing over their political opponents. So we invaded a country that didn't attack us, with many innocent people tortured by the state, with the justification from coerced people... Like this is a textbook example of why torture is dumb. It's coercing people into saying whatever they think their captor wants to hear.

We know the Fidelius won't count the Secret as being given unless the Keeper willingly gives it up without duress being the cause. JKR says this on Pottermore, Cruciatus (hint hint, the Torture Curse) and the Imperius will completely fail to yield the secret from it's Keeper. So yes, the charm can tell if one has spoken freely or not.

I don't see how your example prevents Bob from willingly giving it up to someone who isn't coercing him. And even when coerced, he can say the information but it won't count as giving the secret. The magic only counts it if he chooses to and the person isn't making overt or obvious threats to force it out.
