The short answer is no.

The long answer is that Horcruxes and Dementors are 2 completely different things.

Horcruxes are physical vessel containing the shard of the soul of a wizard, which is used to hold said soul into the living world even if his body is destroyed. Since Horcruxes are the "opposite" of a soul, the soul shard cannot exist without its physical vessel. Because of this, wizard wishing to make one are first invited to create a suitable vessel, by putting protections on the item they wish to use (puting a soul shard into an item does not automatically make it resistant to damages).\\
When dealing with an Horcruxe, the true question is not "Can this substance or this spell kill the Horcruxe?", but rather "Can this substance or spell make more damages to the vessels than its protections can withstand?" (this is one of the reasons why the Killing Curse should be totally useless to deal with Horcruxes). In Voldemort case, Fienfyre and Basislisk Venom are 2 things which proved to be able to destroy its Horcruxe. But a less talented wizard would probably have a less well protected Horcruxe (which could be destroy by more banal means), and it is speculated that, had Voldemort got access to Phoenix Tears or Goblin Silver, he may have been able to create an Horcruxe resistant to Basilisk Venom (though nothing known in canon seem to resist to Fiendyre).

As for the Dementors, they cannot be killed, because they are not alive in the first place. They interact at least partially with the physical world (which is why they can be slowed by a physical obstacle, like a closed door), but only the Patronus Charm can truly stop a dementor, and even if this case, the spell is unable to hurt it.\\
All the amortal beings of the HP universe (Lethifolds, Boggarts, Poltergeists and Dementors) share the common characteristic to be impossible to kill, hurt or even exorcist. The only "exception" to this rule would be the Poltergeist, which are physically linked to a place. Should the Hogwarts castle be destroyed, and all his bricks removed, Peeves should "disappear" (not die though, just cease to exist), though the reconstruction of the castle and the gathering of a bunch of young, excited witches and wizards would quickly see the apparition of a new Poltergeist.\\
Sadly, other amortals does not share this limitation of Poltergeist. I guess making the emotion they are linked to /may/ make them disappear, but you can't really remove Fear or Sadness from the world.
