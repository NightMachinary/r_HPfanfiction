Horcruxes are hard to kill because they're hard to permanently damage.

They've got every durability and self repair spell their creator can think of and were probably made from something pretty durable to begin with.

Basilisk venom works because the only counter is phoenix tears and you can't really include those, fiendfire is seemingly some very potent dark magic and nearly as hard to stop as the killing curse, it likely takes active casting of a specific counter curse to stop.

Now the reason those two work and a simple killing curse doesn't is that you don't kill a horcrux, the whole point is that you can't, what you do is destroy the vessel, and a severed chunk of soul can't survive alone, it needs a container and is therefore destroyed when you set it free.
