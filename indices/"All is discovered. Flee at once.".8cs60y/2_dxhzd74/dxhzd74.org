It was chaos, born of a calm breakfast.

Breakfast wasn't meant to be calm. Breakfast was meant to be chaos. But....as Daily Prophets failed to arrive, letters never showed, and Draco Malfoy waited for his care package, people began to panic. Where was the mail? Had something happened?

By the end of the day, the Wizarding World had descended into out right chaos.

It wasn't just Hogwarts.

It wasn't even limited to Magical Britain.

Or the Magical World.

All over the world, no matter how primitive, or how intricately engineered, cages were empty. Nests not abandoned, but gone as though never having existed - even feathers, used as lining in other bird nests, disappeared.

Owls had left the realm, taking with them every bit of physical evidence that they had ever been there.

Of course, no one ever figured out it was due to a poorly trained young raven who mistakenly took a warning meant for "Mundungus Fletcher" to an owl named "Mundungus Fetching", sent by a dyslexic associate of Mr Fletcher the human.
