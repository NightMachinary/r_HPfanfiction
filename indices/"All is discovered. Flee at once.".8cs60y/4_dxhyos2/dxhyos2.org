It was meant to be a joke. A bit of fun, to try get a rise out of a friend. I mean, she wasn't a close friend, but she was still a friend. Well. Acquaintance, really. It's hard to have friendships with other houses, and really, what's the point? Our own House is already 'like a family', and who needs more family? Not the Weasleys. So yeah, I know my classmates by first name, nod to them in the halls, chat here and there. It's not like my parents and grandparents days, where all the Houses were wary of each other. Then, it was perfectly normal for Hufflepuff to turn on a student, for Slytherin to be ostracized, for Ravenclaw to be ignored. These days, the Houses are pretty friendly to each other.

And then, I send off this note. "All is discovered - initiate Plan Omega ASAP."

The next day - well, the entire House had disappeared. I heard they STILL hadn't broken into the sealed common room - though the Map verifies that none of them are on school grounds. Uncle Harry confiscated it, of course. Can't really argue though, I want to find my cousin, too. I'm just thankful Weasleys mostly go to Gryffindor - apparently, all alumni have disappeared. That means someone who used to belong to a House, according to Aunt Hermione. Gran must be going spare - apparently the family clock has stopped working, but at least there's only one grandchild missing out of the entire lot of us.

You wouldn't think it though - honestly, it's the last House you'd expect to have a secret, let alone a Plan Omega level one. I wonder what would have happened if I said Plan Hinkypuff or something. Plan Niffler - ha, that'd probably be worse! Everyone suspects the Hufflepuffs - Slytherin is too obvious, these days, and Gryffindor can't hide a thing, but Hufflepuff are so nice that they scream "it's a cover! We're evil!".

No one looks at a Ravenclaw.
