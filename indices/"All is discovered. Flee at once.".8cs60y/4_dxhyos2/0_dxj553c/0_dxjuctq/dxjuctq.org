Oops. Probably should have spent a but more time on it. Basically, a next-gen Weasley, probably Fred or Roxie, sent the note as a joke to a Ravenclaw mate. Turns out Ravenclaw have a secret ongoing plot/research/experiment that probably breaks the laws of magic, as well as lots of other laws as well, and that they had an ultimate escape plan titled Omega. Omega basically is a total shut down of all things Ravenclaw, which includes the Tower.

It's a play on the fact that Slytherins generally always do have some secret agenda, and that the Hufflepuffs are often used in parody fics as being a secret cult, or communists, or undercover badasses, but no one looks at Ravenclaw. They're just solitary nerds. So I thought they'd be the least obvious House, and tried to write it so that it came as a surprise twist at the end. With Albus Severus in Slytherin, Teddy and conceivably others in Hufflepuff, you might assume the missing cousin, Hugo, is one of them.
