"Oh come on, Harry, it'll never work."

Harry turned to Hermione as he was tying the latest, ever-so-slightly-personalised letter to Lucius Malfoy to an owl's leg in the Owl Office in Hogsmeade, "There's always the tiny chance that it will. Besides, I'm only out 4 galleons if nothing happens."

"Don't let Ron hear you say that, he's still moping a bit about the DA fake galleons..." Hermione muttered.

Lucius Malfoy frowned; who would be sending priority owl post to him? At least he could be sure it was free of any curses, the seal on the bird's other leg proved it was from a qualified owl office and they were fastidious about refusing to take cursed letters...unless the seal was faked...

After waving his wand in a few detection patterns just to make doubly sure, he carefully removed the letter and opened it.

His eyes widened. His legs wobbled. His forehead began to sweat. The handwriting wasn't familiar, nor was there any signature, but...

/You've been exposed. Escape Britain immediately./

Lucius darted up the stairs of his manor, "Narcissa!" he shouted.

The next morning, Draco Malfoy's usual seat at the Slytherin table was empty.

...Actually, quite a few seats at the Slytherin table were empty. Some were missing from the other houses too. Dolores Umbridge had vanished from the staff table along with, strangely, Filius Flitwick.

"Harry!" Hermione hissed across the Gryffindor table as the Great Hall murmured curiously about the vacancies, "Just /how/ many of those letters did you send?"

"I forgot!" Harry whispered back, "I lost track after the first three hundred!"
