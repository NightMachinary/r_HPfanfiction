"Hey, Fred 'n George, you know how Patronus messages are a thing?"

"Yeah...?"

"Well, I just heard about this Muggle prank that I think we could adapt..."

*===[LATER]===*

Dumbledore was pondering the meaning of Life, Paperwork, and Lemon Drops, when an ethereal stag burst into the room. Expecting a message for himself, the Headmaster was shocked when the Patronus turned to portrait of Phineas Nigellus and spoke in a low, deep voice.

"/Flee at once: all is discovered./"

The portrait blinked confusedly as muffled cursing came from his frame. "What-"

He was cut off when his frame swung outwards, revealing a moderately sized space behind it. An overgrown ferret clutching a bulging sack leapt outwards and scampered for the window. "FUCK SHIT BITCH DAMMIT HOW THE SHIT DID THEY FIND OUT FUCK SHIT DAMMIT SHIT" The animal slipped the sack over its shoulder and jumped out the window, still cursing.

Dumbledore's lemon drop fell out of his mouth as he turned to the other portraits in the room. "Did... did any of you know there was a Jarvey that lived there?"

The Hogwarts Heads of ages past shook their heads silently, still bewildered. Dumbledore nodded pensively before looking at the yellow candy dissolving on the desk. "I don't /think/ these are the spiked ones?"
