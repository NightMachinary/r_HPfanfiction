Thank you! I don't think I can deal with reading one where either James OR Lily survives cause that would break my heart. But maybe if you know some good ones! I would love some with Remus raising Harry as well tho ðŸ§¡

I shall try not to start reading any of these before after Wednesday tho! Exam week!
