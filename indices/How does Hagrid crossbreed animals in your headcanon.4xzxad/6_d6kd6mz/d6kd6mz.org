What if he's like Dr. Frankenstein and literally attaches pieces together?

In canon, though, I think that Hagrid probably used the Pokemon Center method, by which I mean that he throws all the animals in one pen because he thinks they can just magically get along (lol) and then leaves them to it.

He's probably like "and then I found this egg!" All happy like in the Great Hall while Minerva looks at him with a bulging forehead vein and says "remind me to Scourgify my brain."
