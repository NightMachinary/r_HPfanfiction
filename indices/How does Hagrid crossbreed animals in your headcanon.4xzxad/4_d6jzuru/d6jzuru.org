This is quite literally the first time I have ever considered that. I suppose it depends on whether he is allowed to be doing it or not. Noone says anything about the blast-ended screwts, other than "oh good god, what on earth is that??", so I am assuming that he is permitted to make horrifying crimes against nature all he pleases. This implies he must do it the, ahem, manual way. After all, if magic was needed then everyone would know he was using magic when he wasn't supposed to and he'd have his umbrella snapped. This does imply that at least the mother of any crossbreeds must be a magical species of course, otherwise the manual method wouldn't work.

This does raise questions of whether a centaur was originally a crossbreed. If so, then either the mother was a witch, which means there's a possibility that the father was a non-magical horse, in which case Ew and also Ick, also this implies a whole bunch of charms to make that possible. Or the father was a human, and there is some sort of magical horse out there, so centaurs are actually half unicorn/Pegasus/Kelpie. As the centaur herd is in Scotland, and kelpies are from Scottish mythology and said to be able to take human form, I rather prefer that idea. Either that or we now know the answer to the question of "if an animagus gets pregnant or impregnates something while in animal form, what species will the babies be?"
