There's canonical mention of a werewolf being bred while in her were form and having pups, I believe, which leads me to think an animagus could probably also get impregnated or sire on an actual animal. There could've been a very horny animagus that turned into a horse and just traveled the world sampling mares.... BRB need brain bleach.
