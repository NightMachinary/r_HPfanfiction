Given that the Ban on Experimental Breeding was instituted as recently as 1965, I'd guess that the process is fairly simple. In the case of the Skrewts it involved a firecrab egg, some Manticore sperm, a cauldron and the waving of a pink umbrella at various junctures, following a recipe book kept in the Restricted Section of Hogwarts' library. At least Hagrid waited until his name was cleared before he started making them.

Does anyone recall whether they were around for the Battle of Hogwarts?
