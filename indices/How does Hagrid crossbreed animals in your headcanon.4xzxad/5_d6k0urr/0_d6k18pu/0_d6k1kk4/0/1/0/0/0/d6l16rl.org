  And on the other hand, they have spells that do a lot of what they should never ever be able to do should knowledge of biology, physics, or chemistry, ever be the limiting factor; and that's not even going into the fact that there is magic in potions in and of themselves.

And how does that relate to the knowledge of sperm and (microscopic) egg, isolating them and inducing fertilization outside of a living organism? Or rather, since you don't seem to get it, do they /know/ what spermatozoa and ova are?

  You are the one who went from “mixing stuff in a cauldron with a bit of wand waving” to “it has to be /in vitro/” and then started talking about how it's impossible for them because /requirements for in vitro/. While it is true that the wizards do not have the requisite knowledge of biology to be capable of in vitro conception, what is described in the very message that'd started the exchange between the two of you is not actually in vitro (which is why I used “in lebes”: “in a cauldron/pot”).

Lmao did you read anything I wrote? I called it /in vitro/ because /in vitro/ is what it is, albeit in a metal and rather large test tube. It's /in vitro/ as opposed to /in vivo/ fertilization. But feel free to point out where I mentioned tech.
