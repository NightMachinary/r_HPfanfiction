How about this new fic called Puzzle linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6622580/1/Puzzle]])? It's not 100k words, but it's regularly updating and is interesting so far. It's Snape/Lily.

linkffn(A dream carved in stone) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8134710/1/A-Dream-Carved-in-Stone]] An AU Snape Lily fic

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/670548]]) The boy who died a lot. It's involves time loops of Snape having to go back and keep saving Harry from dying in all kinds of ridiculous and not ridiculous ways but it's great and really hilarious at times.
