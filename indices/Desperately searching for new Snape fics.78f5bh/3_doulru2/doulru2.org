I can't tell if you mean new as in "recent" or simply "new to me," so I'll just toss out some recs.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/chapters/23404335][Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions]] by Wyste. This is a series, and here's the first part. It turns out Harry finds potions fascinating. Snape mentors him despite misgivings. Seems to be setting up H/D later in the series. Short chapters, easy, sardonic narrative voice. No Snape romance.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/96429/chapters/131926][Everybody's Fool]] by Cluegirl. Snape/Harry, includes magical warding and virgin!Snape.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/55402][Subjectiverse]] by potionpen. Snape/Rosier. Starts more or less with Snape getting a wand and then being sorted into Slytherin. Another series-in-progress. This one may be an acquired taste, as it's very much the fan author's version of Snape rather than Rowling's.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11284494/chapters/25241499][Of A Linear Circle]] by flamethrower. Yet another series-in-progress. Snape/Salazar Slytherin's brother, who starts out as a 1000-year-old portrait.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/147439/chapters/210857][Into the Fold]] by Pasi. How Snape becomes a Death Eater. Involves a great deal of potions and Dark Magic practice. Unrequited Snape/Lily, not very shippy at all.
