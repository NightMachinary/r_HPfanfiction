So I just read Into the Fold and I'm honestly blown away by it. I shouldn't have been considering this is the same author of Penultimate Acts, and I'm kicking myself for not googling them from Snapecase. First War Death Eater Snape fics are so hard to find, especially one that keeps everyone in character. This is one of the best Snape character studies I've read, inciting both feelings of heartbreak and disgust, and I've usually found Snape fics to arouse one instead of the other. I am so pissed off that this has only 28 kudos over the crap that gets 1000s. Thank you for the recommendation!

Do you know of any more similar Snape character studies? Especially long ones?
