  After the fall of Voldemort, the students whose 7th year was so heavily impacted by the war and the Death Eater-takeover at Hogwarts have been called back to retake their last year of school. The power balances in the wizarding world are shifting, but at Hogwarts, the old alliances remain unchanged. The animosity between Slytherin and Gryffindor is as strong as ever, and while Draco is trying to restore some of the lost power and influence of House Malfoy, everyone is trying to come to terms with what happened during the war and who they are now. Voldemort may be gone, but it would be a lie to say that all is well.
