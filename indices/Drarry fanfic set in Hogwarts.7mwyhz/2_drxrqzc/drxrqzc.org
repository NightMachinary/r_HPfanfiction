([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9756136/1/Everything-s-Different-yet-Everything-s-the-Same)ffnbot!directlinks]] I don't know if this will fit exactly what you want because it's a time travel fic but it is Drarry set in Hogwarts. Either way it's a really interesting story and take on things. Unfortunately it is unfinished though.
