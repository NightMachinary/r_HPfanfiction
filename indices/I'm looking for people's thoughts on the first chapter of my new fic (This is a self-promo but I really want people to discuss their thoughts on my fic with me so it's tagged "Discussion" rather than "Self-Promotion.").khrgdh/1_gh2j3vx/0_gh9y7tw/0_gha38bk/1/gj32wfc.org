Since my reply apparently didn't go through, I'm going to answer them again, lol. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

I haven't really decided whether or not Theo will find out who sent them back in time. I think that the closest they're gonna get is them figuring out what the ritual was and that there's no "undo" button for it or whatever. (And I just got the idea, but I may write it that they were possibly sent back via Unspeakables? Or perhaps a group that talks to the Gods---hel/lo/ Master of Death shenanigans!---and that the thing won't happen now that they "fixed" everything. Like, the ritual only works or whatever if one of the people is also a God or deity or extremely powerful---cough, Harry, cough---themselves.)

I was originally planning on them not letting anyone in on the secret, but when I wrote this out the first time, I actually had the idea of both Draco and Blaise figuring out. Basically, Harry's going to form some sort of Marauder group with the two of them and Theo (but they're not really going to act like the Marauders, it's just the fact that there the four of them seem to be close-knit reminds the teachers---Remus in particular when he comes to teach---of James and them). Blaise is pretty much going to find out between the summer of second year and the summer after third year. Basically, Harry and Theo are going to Greece because they heard of some guy who collected time travel shit, and someone (probably Harry) will leave a book on time travel out and Blaise will make---correct---conclusions. Draco will probably find out either during fourth, fifth, or sixth year.

Remus and Sirius finding out is up for debate. You're correct when you say that Sirius is going to need some sirius---pun most definitely intended---therapy and mind-healing. He's pretty immature and he relies way too much on Dumbledore for my tastes. (Regretably, this isn't going to be one of those fics where Dumbledore knowingly leaves Sirius in Azkaban. It just wouldn't fit in with the slightly-meddling! and not-evil!Dumbledore.)

Which leads to your next question: When is Sirius going to get a trial?

Well, I pretty much answered that in the other reply. Harry is going to get super into politics around fifth or sixth year, so that's when Sirius is going to get exonerated. Whether or not he picks up the mantle of Lord Black remains to be seen. Harry isn't going to like leaving Sirius in hiding because he remembers what happened last time that happened, but he can't really get Sirius an immediate trial unless he wants to show his hand too early. To pretty much stop Sirius from getting stir-crazy in a Black-house-shaped-Azkaban, he's going to convince him to pretty much take charge. He isn't going to let Mrs Weasley take charge of Sirius's house (and throw away all of that knowledge!) and he's not going to let the Order/Dumbledore boss Sirius around. He'll just tell him to transfigure himself a collar and to run around as Padfoot like a dog who got off-leash.

I pretty much plan to use the proxy idea. I'm not sure who's going to take up being Lord Potter, but Andromeda will most likely be the proxy for the Black seat. At this point, Harry will be on decent terms with Lucius and Narcissa, but he won't put them in danger by having Narcissa be the Black proxy while Voldemort's up walking around.

Snape's definitely going to be given a little hell. I'm not really sure if I'll let him in on the secret, but Harry's definitely going to enjoy subtly making him hate himself just a little more. Probably just things like him acting super uncomfortable with him (because Harry will be super uncomfortable because of the mind-rape and death thing) and perhaps even flinching and Harry making innocent comments that show his abuse.

Since I want Snape to be somewhat forgivable, I'm not really going to have him be obsessed with Lily. I'll have him love her, no doubt about that, but the way he'll actually view her is as a sister. Everyone just /thought/ he loved her romantically. How Harry discovers this is by two ways; Harry and Snape eventually become close (like I mentioned in my previous response, or Harry visits Godric's Hollow and finds some of his mum's journals that have letters from Snape between the pages---with him calling her "Sister."

I'll also have Harry be befriending Neville (he was still good friends with him after everything was over and since Neville's really good at herbology and has his own gardens with really good herbs, so Harry will defend his friendship with the boy as tutoring lessons and him getting fresh potions ingredients since some Slytherins will see that friendship as weak), so he'll try to get Snape to lay-off him.

Hope that answers any remaining questions!
