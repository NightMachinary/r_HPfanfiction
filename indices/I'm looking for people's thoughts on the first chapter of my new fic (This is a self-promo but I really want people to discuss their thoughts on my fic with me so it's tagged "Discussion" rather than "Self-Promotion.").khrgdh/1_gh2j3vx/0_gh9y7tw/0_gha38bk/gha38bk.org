Thanks for the answers :D Here are some more questions: Will they figure out who send them back? Or that answer will be lost because they already changed the future so it won't be necessary to send them back again? So that group identity remain a secret for good? Or knowing Harry's curoisity he won't rest until he figures it out. Are they going to tell someone that they are from the future? Draco or Blaise? Or even Sirius? Probably not Sirius, he needs to heal a lot to be trusted I think. And here is my other question: what will they do with Sirius? I mean when will Harry help him get a proper trial? After 4th year? After all he will be the Lord to two Most Ancient and Noble Houses. So he can use his power in the Wizangemont to exonerate Sirius. I think you should use the proxy idea, it will give Harry more time to his other activities. Okay, I understand why would you want Snape to remain close, but please give him a little hell after what he did in the previous timeline, the bullying, the mindrape, his obsession with Lily (that is creepy!) and his treatment toward Nevill. I think that's it. You answerd most of my questions :)
