Eee! Thank you so much for the comment! This got me so excited, lol.

For the first question, I do plan at some point doing some other peoples' point of view. The chapter I'm writing now, the third one, I actually originally planned to write in Theo's PoV but decided to go with Harry's. Other than Theo, I'm not really sure whose PoV I really want to do. However, I will probably only have either short interlude chapters with someone else's view on something (i.e. Dumbledore, Snape, Remus, and Sirius) that are only about a thousand words or so. I don't want to be one of those people who write a chapter that's all over the place.

I definitely plan on writing out the whole seven years! I plan to deviate from the original plot of the books in some spots so there will be plenty of different stuff (I forgot the word, lol) to read.

From what I can guess currently, the years will definitely be drawn out in some places while short in others. A part of first year will be short as I will skip a lot of the original plot for certain events, while other parts will be drawn out. This is because I actually plan to have Harry be Sorted into Slytherin. I know this is done a lot, but I really do want him to work with a lot of the Slytherins and to have a reason to be sort of closer to Theo. I also just want to play around with Slytherin politics, lol.

So, first year will probably (I am pretty much guessing for all of these, don't take them to be literal) be between 3-7 chapters, depending on how I write it second year will be around 5 chapters, third year will hopefully contain a lot of Slytherin politics so depending on how that goes it'll probably be at least 5-10 chapters long, fourth year is kind of a toss-up because we already know how much of that goes so it's between 3-10 chapters long, fifth year will contain /a lot/ of politics and Harry preparing for (or dealing with the after-effects of) becoming emancipated so it'll probably be around 5-10 chapters long, and sixth and seventh year are kind of uncharted territory for now.

The summers between the years will also vary in length. For now, I only really know how the summers before first year, after fourth year, and either before fourth or after fifth year will take place. Depending on how long the chapters are (usually between 3-5k words a chapter, though I'm dabbling in extremely long chapters), there will be at least one to two chapters a summer.

(So far, I plan for the summers to feature Harry and Theo discussing what they're going to do for the next year, what they plan to do with various Horcruxes, and them trying to find the ritual that sent them into the past in the first place. At least one chapter will even feature them travelling to a different country.)

This leads to your next topic: Horcruxes and the original timeline.

For the most part, I plan to let things run their course in the first few years with a few notable changes in the plot. Those will be based around Harry's Sorting into Slytherin (and his Sorting itself), of course. That conversation Harry had with Dumbledore at the end of second year will be fun.

I haven't decided yet, but I think I may end up having Harry leave the Diadem alone until second year. I'll probably have him stop by the Room of Requirement when going to get Ginny from the Chamber so he can destroy the Diary and the Diadem together. He'll probably just leave the destroyed diadem in the Chamber because I plan on having Harry explore the Chamber of Secrets later on.

Most Horcruxes will probably be gathered around fifth year. Slytherin's Locket will definitely be grabbed and destroyed when Harry goes to Grimmauld Place. So far, that'll be the Diary, Ravenclaw's Diadem, and Slytherin's Locket down, leaving the Gaunt Ring, Hufflepuff's Cup, Nagini, and Harry himself. The Ring and the Cup will probably be taken out at the same time since I plan on Harry getting into Bellatrix's vault and I don't want Dumbledore to die (no matter how meddling I make him).

I kind of debated on when to kill Nagini. There are two choices: Have Harry kill her in the graveyard or have Harry kill her when he gets his Horcrux removed. The first option, while the easiest, will no doubt piss Voldemort off to no end and he may end up getting paranoid enough to remove his Horcruxes from where they are and realize that half of them are already dead or are in enemy hands. I really don't want to tangle with that idea, so when Harry dies it is. I'll probably have Theo do it.

As for the events, pretty much all of them will be played out. Meaning, Hermione will be attacked by the troll (with Harry saving her), Ginny will be taken into the Chamber (with Harry saving her), Sirius's (and then Pettigrew's) escape will be the same, and so will the main course of the tournament. However, Cedric's not gonna die in this one and while I'm debating whether or not to have Harry get the Chinese Fireball to speak to Parseltongue in, I think I'm just going to have that be the same as well.

Fifth year is where we'll see a lot of changes. Harry /will not/ allow himself to be tortured by Umbitch. Not only will he be (and know) that he's the heir to two Most Ancient and Noble Houses, but he'll also be the /Lord/ to two Most Ancient and Noble Houses. How I deal with that, exactly remains up to debate, however. I might just have Harry ignore her or maybe he'll catch Umbitch carving out Tracey's and some first year half-blood or Muggleborn Slytherin's hand up and he'll get pissed or something.

Harry will also either be appointing himself a proxy for the Wizengamot, or he'll be attending the Wizengamot itself. Sixth year will probably feature Harry, Theo, Draco, and probably some others actually attending Lords and Ladies functions themselves.

For Harry's persona, he probably won't hide it for the most part since he's pretty much just a bit more cunning and quiet, but he'll also mislead Dumbledore a bit. He'll react to the mirror similarly (or even /worse/ in first year) and he'll play up not wanting to be like Tom Riddle after saving Ginny from the Basilisk.

He'll play along with some of Dumbledore's manipulations (such as staying with the Dursleys, but he's not going to deal with their shit and he'll be hanging out with his friends or taking a little trip to Egypt or Italy) for the most part, but he won't allow himself to be turned into a martyr. He'll probably begin to show that he's not fond of Dumbledore in fourth year because the man could've gotten him out of the Tournament, but he'll definitely ignore him during the summer after fourth year due to Dumbledore telling Harry's friends not to write to him (only his Gryffindor friends, mind, I may actually have Harry still be somewhat friends with Hermione and maybe even Ron, just not close friends) and then that little trick he tried to play on the dementors as well as ignoring him.

And for the Snape bit, I'm sorry to say that I really don't intend on sending him to Azkaban or being outed as an "actual" Death Eater. I just really don't know how to write that out and I feel like it won't go with my story. I plan on Harry being on at least cordial tones with him (though Harry will definitely give Snape some grief in the beginning), though I might have Snape realize Harry's being abused sometime and the relationship will play out from there.

(There's a fifty-fifty chance that Harry either acts cordial with the man as a strict student-teacher relationship, or Snape loses his bitterness over James Potter and they sort of not become mentor-mentee, but Snape kind of talks to Harry sometimes or he gives Harry some books for his search or something. Snape could be useful, who knows.)

Other than that, I'm not going to kill or imprison Snape. I /did/ say that this fic is kind of a fix-it and that includes as least deaths as possible.

I know it's a bit disappointing as I also tend to jump on the "crucify Snape" bandwagon half the time, but I feel like that won't fit in and that Harry and Snape being cordial to one another will definitely be useful in the future (possibly for antagonizing Sirius, who knows).

Thanks for letting me rant this out, lol. The reason I asked for people's thoughts and questions in the first place was to actually help me plan out my fic and work out what will happen in it, so your questions are very helpful!

(Also, now that I think about it, I may end up writing a different fic to post when this is done about pretty much the same plot with a few changes, but instead with Harry in Gryffindor, him not pushing away Ron and Hermione at the end of the series, and Draco being his partner instead. I already had the idea bouncing around in my head, but your question or whether or not Harry will hide his true personality is making me itch to write it. I'll just continue with the two fics I'm already posting, though, lol.)

And since I really like working this out, you said you have other questions?
