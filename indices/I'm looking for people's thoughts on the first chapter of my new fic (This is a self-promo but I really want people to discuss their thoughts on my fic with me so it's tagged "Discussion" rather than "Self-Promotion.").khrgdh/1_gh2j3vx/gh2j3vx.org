Hi! I really liked your first two chapters. I love Theo/Harry pairings, so extra thanks for your fic :)

First question: will there be chapters from Theo's point of view? Or this will be only Harry POV? Or someone else?

Are you planning to write the whole 7 years or will there be time jumps? How many chapters will there be in specific years? I mean are you planning to drawn out all the years or will there be some that will get 1 or 2 chapters and the rest more? Like example the 4th year will be longer then the previously ones?

About the Horcruxes....I think you can systematically destroy them: the tiara will be the easiest, but only after the chamber fiasco and then of course the diary, the locket after 4th year and if Harry will be emancipated then he can access the cup as Heir Black.....

I have so many questions. Will Harry and Theo let some events play out the same as in the original timeline? Like the troll with Hermione, the diary with Ginny and Malfoy Senior, Sirius escape, Harry's competition in the Tournament? Umbridge? And Dumbledore? Is Harry going to hide his new persona? Or will he show that he can't be manipulated? Or just simple wait until he is emancipated? What about Snape? Will he finally end up in Azkaban? Because I would really like to read a fic where he finally gets what he deserves. After all he turned spy after the prophecy but before that he was a loyal Death Eater. Will he be punished for his crimes?

I have some more but I will let you answer these :D
