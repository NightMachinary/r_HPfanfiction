This sounds like a really good idea! The first chapter was fun to read, and I'll continue reading when it gets updated. I'd be interested to see how you handle the Harry/Theo relationship since I've never seen them interact properly in any fics before. Having the horcruxes last a bit longer sounds like a good idea; it's no fun if they get destroyed super easily, lol.

Having their reason for time travelling being more distressing/discussed could improve it, especially if it's expanded upon in later chapters.

Really enjoyed this chapter and can't wait to read more!
