Thank you so much! I've actually just completed the second chapter if you want to check it out!

It's actually kind of a little darker than I anticipated (nothing gory, just mentions of child abuse and swearing), and kind of feels like a filler chapter so I'd appreciate your thoughts on it. I feel like I don't really further the plot much save for the latter portion of the chapter and it feels a bit rushed and surreal compared to the first chapter. The ending doesn't seem particularly good, either. It's also significantly longer.

Expanding on their discussion on time travelling will definitely be discussed in future chapters because not only does it explain more about Harry (not that you don't already have an idea as to why he wanted to go back in time in the first place), but it also reveals an event of Theo's past that Harry hasn't learned about yet. It will be the basis of explaining why Theo is how he is and why his childhood is comparatively shitty to Harry's. This will also further their personal relationship with one another. And although I haven't read Cursed Child and I don't like what I've heard about it, it will also tie in the mention of Theo in that book with him creating a time turner.
