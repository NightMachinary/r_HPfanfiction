[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7573003/1/Harry-s-had-Enough][Harry's had Enough]] by sprinter 1988 and it's sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7782623/1/Damn-Wizards][Damn Wizards]] is a good example of this.

Basically, Harry leaves the rewarding world some time around his 5th year and eventually becomes the muggle prime minister trying to bring down the statute of secrecy.
