I think Ron was more ashamed of Arthur's (unreasonable) enthusiasm towards his job rather then the job itself. I mean, Ron collects a comicbook series with a Muggle main character: /The Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad Muggle/. I think it's save to say that he has no problems at all with muggles appart from not understanding much of their culture.

Anyway, my point is that I find it a bit far fetched to extrapolate the whole wizarding world's view on employing muggleborns by how Arthur Weasley (not a muggleborn) is treated in his job. I'm not saying that I think the argument unreasonable. I readily believe that there is discrimination agains muggles and muggleborns in the wizarding world. Otherwise it would have been a lot harder for Voldemort to gain followers the first time around. I also see how it might be harder for muggleborns and squibs to find jobs (see Filch). I just don't think it's impossible. Especially for Hermione how was repeatedly called the 'brightest witch of her generation'.
