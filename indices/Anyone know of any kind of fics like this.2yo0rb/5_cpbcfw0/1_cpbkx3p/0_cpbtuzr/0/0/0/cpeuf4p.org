It does kind of imply that the Wizarding World looks down on Muggles/Muggleborns, through the mocking of Arthur's job. I mean, his own children (namely Ron & Percy) are somewhat ashamed of his lowly job. Though it doesn't say explicitly that the Ministry definitely bans Muggleborns from +certain+ positions, it does paint a (slightly?) distorted picture.
