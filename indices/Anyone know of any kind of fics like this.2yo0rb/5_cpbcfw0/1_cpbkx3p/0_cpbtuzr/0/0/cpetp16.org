Okay, I see how Arthur's paygrade might imply about the Ministry's view on muggles. That doesn't necessarily say anything about it's view on muggleborns, though. One group being part of their society, the other group being a threat to it, no matter how much the don't want to admit it. That being said, I've been trying to remember about characters blood- and social status and I'm drawing a blank at finding any adult muggleborns (that we know of) who are employed. Then again, we don't know about all the characters' blood status. There might very well have been muggleborn Unspeakables or Healers. Also, it's not like the Ministry is the only possible employer one could find in the wizarding world. Not eveyone works for the government.
