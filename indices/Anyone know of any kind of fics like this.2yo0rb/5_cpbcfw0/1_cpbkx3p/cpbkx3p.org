Because outside of the Weasley's (sans Percy), Neville, Hermione, and Luna. He was treated like crap. The entire government, press, and population were out to get him. The world was almost unfixably bigoted and either did not want to be saved, or wanted someone else to save them. And it went the same for many of his friends and loved ones. Hermione before the war would never have been able to be gainfully employed, just because she was muggle born. Sirius was thrown into prison without a trial Remus, the kindest man alive was basically homeless.

Why on earth would he want to stay in a world like that, that was unwilling to change?
