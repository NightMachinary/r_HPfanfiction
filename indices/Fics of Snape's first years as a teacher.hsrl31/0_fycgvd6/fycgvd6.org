There is a bit of it in linkao3(Hatching Robin by Teao), which is the prequel to linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao), but reading the latter is certainly not the prerequisite of reading the former. It is a WAY better explanation of Snape's true loyalties than the obsessive flimsy canonical excuse for the reason.
