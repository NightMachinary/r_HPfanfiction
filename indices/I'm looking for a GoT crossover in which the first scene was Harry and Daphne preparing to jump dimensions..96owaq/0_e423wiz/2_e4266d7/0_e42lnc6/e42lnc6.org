After reading it, I remember why I originally put it down after a few chapters.

Harry and consorts are all - 100% of them - absolute psychopaths. Quite frankly, it just gets boring to read about them killing.

Psychopaths are just not fun to read about, not to mention that they're so far removed from anything remotely reminding of their canon characters that it might as well be a different fandom.
