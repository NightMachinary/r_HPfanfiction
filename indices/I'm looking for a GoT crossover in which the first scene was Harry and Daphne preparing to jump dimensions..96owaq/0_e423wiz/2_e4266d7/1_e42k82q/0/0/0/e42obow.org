You don't need offensive magic to stomp Westeros. All you need is Hermione, someone with a lot of magical power (like Harry) and the favour of a minor lord. Hermione, using her magic, could easily jumpstart an industrial revolution and someone like Harry could use his "muscle" for menial tasks. Multiplying steel plates, gun barrels or shells, applying vanishing charms to improve pumps, reinforcing machinery and so on.

You could probably field a 20th-century army within a month, armed with everything from rifles and grenades up to field artillery. Transfiguration is a bitch if you think about it and it does not randomly expire in canon.
