Not a point of divergence but Linkffn(Deal With A Devil) has COS turning into a deadly horror show till the school is closed. Continued in an unofficial sequel.

A certain unmentionable 800k fic by Noodle hammer has Terry Boot being killed by the basilisk. Being as divisive as it is, search around before reading it.

Linkffn(Her Mother's Love) The basilisk is released into the great hall and several students are murdered in the Chamber.
