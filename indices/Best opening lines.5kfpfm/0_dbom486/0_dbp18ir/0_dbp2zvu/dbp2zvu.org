Actually actually, it's a crossover with specifically the first game in the series, which is why I wrote that it is a video game rather than a whole series.

Your comment did make me aware that there is another game with the same title, but as that other game seems to be of a completely different genre and I presume it is decidedly less known than a fairly popular game released many years later that did well enough to get sequels, I do not think it easy to mistake which one I meant.
