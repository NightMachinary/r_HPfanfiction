It's not exactly just a single line and it's from a Harry Potter story of any kind, but I quite like this one:

  It was a dark and stormy night.

  Well, no, it wasn't. It was certainly stormy, for slashing rain whipped across the wind-tossed countryside, and the sky was covered from horizon to horizon in clouds the colour of lead. And it was most definitely dark, save for the moments when the entire world was cast into bleak contrast by calamitous crashes of blinding lightning. But it was still mid afternoon, and somewhere above the thick clouds the sun was high and bright, as marked by the patch of sky which was merely iron-coloured, rather than lead.

  Hence, it was a dark and stormy mid-afternoon, which is a phrase with far less poetic cachet and precedence than its nocturnal cousin. Still, two out of three isn't bad. It's sixty-six point six recurring percent. It's a solid pass.

In case anyone is wondering, it's the intro for “Overlady”, a crossover between “ゼロの使い魔/Familiar of Zero” and “Overlord”, the former a light novel (and I guess a series of comics and TV series) and the latter a video game. It's not a perfect story, but there are moments when it's quite hilarious.
