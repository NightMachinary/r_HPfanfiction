We have gone through often enough about this topic here and generally agreed that Dumbledore is mostly a dumbed down plot device in a children's series. Useless and negligent adults are after all trademarks of children's literature, and Harry Potter is not that bad in this regard.

Anyway, if you don't write Dumbledore as an incompetent and criminally negligent plot device, you will get something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], in which the plot is solved and there's nothing to do for the kids.

Therefore, you have to do a lot more changes if you want to write a competent Dumbledore and still end up with canon stations. That's also why I and many others HATE canon rehashes so much.
