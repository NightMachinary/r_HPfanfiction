My problem with Petrification Prolifiration is that Dumbledore still has done things that should earn him a jail sentence. The whole Philosopher Stone plot in particular and to a lesser extent not doing anything about Harry's abuse.

But this just serves to highlight your point more. If Dumbledore were competent, then the story would look completely different and there would be no place for Harry and his friends to play heroes.

(As an aside you could probably also lay a large part of the Imperius defense working at Dumbledore's feet. To further drive the point home regarding how much canon would need to change with a competent Dumbledore.)
