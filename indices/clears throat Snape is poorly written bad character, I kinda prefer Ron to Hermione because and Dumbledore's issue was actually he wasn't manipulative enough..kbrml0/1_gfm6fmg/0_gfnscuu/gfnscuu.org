  At no point is it even implied, let alone seen, that he is a skilled politician/general.

He walks into the government bumrushing Harry in 5, outmaneuvers everyone in a handful of paragraphs, and walks back out again. He's seen as a leader by literally the entire society, and of the school. He was the leader in every conflict over the last half century that we know about. He was offered Minister three separate times. Implications were all over the series talking about Dumbledore's leadership skills.

You can argue he did all of those things because of incompetence of everyone else, but that would /still/ make him comparatively fall into those roles.
