I'd more say he did that because Rowling wanted him to.

Nothing he did in the trial is uber-political or some sort of great speech or anything. It was typical Rowling. Everything happens because she wants it to.

It's one of her flaws, she writes a great world, but characterization shows the authorial hand -all the time-.
