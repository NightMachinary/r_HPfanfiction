Snape is just a classic incel. He asks Voldemort to kill Lily's husband and child, so that she can then 'become his'. When that falls through he becomes (or stays) a bitter basement dweller who is so hateful that nobody is surprised when he is his students' nightmare fuel (Neville's boggart).

To be fair to Dumbledore, while many bashing fics portray him as some sort of Machiavellian 4D chessmaster, in canon he is arguably just an inspired academic, who ends up thrust into leadership roles because everyone else is so incompetent. At no point is it even implied, let alone seen, that he is a skilled politician/general.
