To be fair, Hermione being trusting to Authority is one of her earlier personality traits, which she has to overcome.

Also, Snape is not a good person. He loves Lily, yes, but that does not make him a good person. He's just an asshole. He hates Harry's guts because he's reminded that Lily chose James over him, because Harry looks exactly like James, but with Lily's eyes. I'm not saying that Snape treating Harry like that is in anyway right, I'm just pointing out that he's not doing bad stuff without reason. Not a good reason, yes, but still a reason. Also, I'm pretty sure Snape doesn't treat all of the students like he treats Harry. Sure, he's unfair and shouldn't be a teacher, but he doesn't try to make students cry.
