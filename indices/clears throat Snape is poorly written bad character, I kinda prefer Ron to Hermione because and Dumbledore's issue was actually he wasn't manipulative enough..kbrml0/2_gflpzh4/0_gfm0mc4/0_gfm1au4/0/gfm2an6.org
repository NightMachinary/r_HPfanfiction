Because Dumbledore needs him, he overlooks the things that would get Snape fired within a day. Meaning, for all Harry and the co.'s frustrations and misgivings about Snape, him staying as a professor was for the best. He is written in such a way that the reader hates him, and yet can see he was an essential part of the victory so has to give him the necessary credit. That, in my opinion, what makes Snape a great character.
