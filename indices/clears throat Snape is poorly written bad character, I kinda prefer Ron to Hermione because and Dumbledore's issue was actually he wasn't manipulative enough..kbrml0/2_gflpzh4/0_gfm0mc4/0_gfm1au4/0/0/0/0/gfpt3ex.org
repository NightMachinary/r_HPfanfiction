But the narrator of the books is Harry. We don't have much information about the last war, and even if he didn't help in this one, he could have still been a major life-saving asset during the last war. Also, I apologize, but I don't get what you mean at the part where you believe he didn't love Lily? Also also, he is a double spy for Dumbledore. You try gaining the trust of a megalomaniac that loves homicide. Trust me, it wouldn't be easy.

Despite all I've said however, I mean no offense, and I would apologize if I did indeed offended you somehow. So... uhh... That's it?
