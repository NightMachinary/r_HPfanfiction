Good point. But even if that's all true, Snape should still be commended for being brave enough to try to redeem himself for the greatest mistake he made, i.e telling Voldemort of the prophecy/becoming a death eater. It's not gonna be easy to be a double spy, considering Voldemort's nature and his views on traitors.
