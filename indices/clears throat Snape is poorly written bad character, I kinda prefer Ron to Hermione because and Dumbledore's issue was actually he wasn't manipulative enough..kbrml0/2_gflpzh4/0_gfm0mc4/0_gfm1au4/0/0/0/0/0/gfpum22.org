You didn't offend me, but Snape simply does not pass the test for well written character. You saying he maybe did stuff behind the scenes, that's bad writing. Show don't tell is an important concept in all forms of media. If Snape is a character we should view as complicated, we should be informed of specific ways he was in fact useful. Also last war remembered Snape turned right when he learned voldemort was gonna kill Harry's family. That's, right right at the end of the war, so he likely wasn't helpful then.
