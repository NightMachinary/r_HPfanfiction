What does Snape do that is vital? We see 0 times where Snape provides information that helped the war. War is not an evil nessisity, but that implies he is competent. He is bad at all his jobs including being a spy. He kills no death eaters, he doesn't stop things like Azkaban being raided. He is a poorly written character. Also he didn't love lily, last hw actually knew her was 15. He is in his 40s by end of the books.
