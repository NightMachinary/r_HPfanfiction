People often shout out, when I say Snape reminds me of a Mary-Sue.

But to me the thing that makes or breaks a Mary-Sue is the fact if the world and the characters are twisted around them. And that happens with Snape.

And that he is always at least a mini-plot twist.

1st book, Oh shock! Snape isn't the evil one

2nd book, that maybe the book without one...

3rd book, Oh shock! Snape was helping Lupin and hated Harry's father and friends.

4th book, Oh shock! Snape is an ex-death eater.

5th book, Oh shock! Snape had a reason to hate Harry's father.

6th book, Oh shock! Snape kills Dumbledore and is the half-blood prince.

7th book, Oh shock! Snape was on the good side in the end and had a thing for Harry's mum.
