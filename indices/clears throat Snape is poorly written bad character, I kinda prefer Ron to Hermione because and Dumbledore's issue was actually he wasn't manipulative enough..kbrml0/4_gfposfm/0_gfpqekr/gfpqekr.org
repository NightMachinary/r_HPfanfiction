Yes exactly. Fun fact, if you critically think through all the books, Snape only is shown to accomplish 3 tasks. He ineffectivly tries to counter the charm on Harry's broom, he brews wolfsbane third year and he delivers them the sword (although he decides to put it in the bottom of a frozen lake, and not say, near a backpack with supplies for them. ). Literally does nothing else in 7 books.
