Yes, he is not a well-written character, he is a walking/talking plot twist.

He doesn't have to be logical in any way, his trauma doesn't need to match his actions, the character we see doesn't need to match his abilities (how often do we see him lose his cool, see him as an emotional and explosive man, with a short temper, who is unable do hide his dislikes but he is such a good spy that he can control even his own thoughts and never let anything shine through? That doesn't make any sense...). And what kind of reminds me of a Mary-Sue, stories and character wrap around him to make him important. Dumbledore apparently doesn't trust anyone, but that spy with questionable loyalty (and every spy's loyalty should always be questioned and a spy should never know more than they really really need to work). And Voldemort, a cruel man to his own followers, is all too happy to trust him again and let him in on sensitive information and into a powerful position? Smart people have to hold the idiot ball really tight to make Snape important...
