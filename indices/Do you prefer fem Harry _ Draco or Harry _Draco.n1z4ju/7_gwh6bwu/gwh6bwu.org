Id say an advantage would be to ensure the character, who will mostly narrate the romance, is of the same gender(s) as you are. This way you will have a sample of the way it feels for you which will add a nice dash of authenticity.

However that's minor, other than that unless you plan to include a very large amount of smut the situation would be more or less the same, unless you want to dig into gender norms in the Wizarding world as well, but that's a whole different kind of fic.
