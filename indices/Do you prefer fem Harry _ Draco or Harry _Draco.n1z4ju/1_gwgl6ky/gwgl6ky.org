Since genderbending is on the table, I'm now curious about stuff such as Harry/fem!Draco.

With genderbenders in general, I think the most interesting part is reading how gender changes interactions and circumstances. Say, would Ivy Potter be treated differently by the Dursleys? Stuff like, sexism, how much more badly it was seen in the 90s to hit a girl. Would Dudley still be as nasty to her as he was to Harry? Would Petunia perhaps be even more of a spiteful shrew towards her than to Harry?

And further, into the Wizarding world. We know the prophesy specifically mentioned the chosen one as a "he". Assuming Ivy is still part of the prophesy and the GWL, just changing the pronoun to "she", would it be possible that some other unlucky girl had her parents tortured to insanity/murdered in Neville's place? How is sexism in the wizarding world, and how would it affect stuff for Ivy, as the GWL?

Had a weird idea about said unlucky girl. Canonically, unlike many fanon plot points, Susan Bones is not actually an orphan raised by Amelia. She does have her parents. Though being targetted by the prophesy, and having her parents tortured to insanity, might be an interesting setup to make that happen. Or maybe we'd have a fem!Neville running around. Or the prophesy was gender-neutral and Neville still applied, leading to tragedy.

On an unrelated note, about fem!Draco. Would she try to emulate Lucius as much, be as close? Would Lucius be disappointed his only heir is, well, a heiress? Or would she perhaps lean more on the "Black" side from Narcissa, as it were? Would she try harder and be even more obnoxious to impress her father instead?

But anyway, I digress. As to the choice between fem!Harry/Draco and Drarry. While I think both could work pretty well, I'd go with the former mainly out of curiosity, see how their rivalry would manifest in those circumstances.
