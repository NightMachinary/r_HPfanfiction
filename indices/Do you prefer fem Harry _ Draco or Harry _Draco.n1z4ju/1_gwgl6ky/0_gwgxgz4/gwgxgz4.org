Thank you so much for your comment!! You've sparked many thoughts in my brain, and I'd quite like to answer and add to your comments.

I think the Dursleys would treat Ivy differently. The house would certainly be rife with sexism and misogyny, especially from Vernon. I think perhaps he'd be less inclined to physically hurt her with cuffs around the head or slapped wrists, like perhaps he would be/have been with Harry, and rather favours verbal attacks about her gender or looks or stupidity etc. Petunia would almost certainly buy into gender stereotypes, so Ivy would grow up with comments like "a lady does not curse" or "girls should have long hair." Perhaps even racism within the household, if you picture harry/ivy with darker skin like some do in fanon.

In my head, for some reason, Harry has a darker complexion. I'm quite a fan of desi Harry. However, though with not as pale skin as Lily, Ivy looks quite a lot like her. Her hair isn't a blood red but rather a deeper auburn and hair is far curlier. So that would definitely impact Petunias behaviour, with her niece looking far too like her dead freak of a sister. Perhaps ivy's hair lightens to that same blood red as she grows older, and Petunia despises her even more for it.

Your comments about the prophecy I found particularly insightful and thought evoking. Honestly the whole concept of Susan being part of the prophecy is very intriguing. I'm not certain I would gender bend neville? Who knows. Or maybe the prophecy is in gender neutral pronouns, and the reason why Voldemort chose Ivy is because, unlike a male Neville, Ivy is his opposite and yet equal in every way. Or perhaps he too buys into the whole sexism thing like a majority of the wizarding world does.

About fem draco, I really like your ideas. I picture a slightly (and by slightly I mean very) snobby little girl who tries to be the proper heir her father always talks about, but still cannot achieve his unfairly high expectations because she is a girl, not the boy her father hoped for. Which would beg the question if she is an only child or not. But I thought for depths sake she would be an only child, perhaps due to Narcissa being unable to carry another child to term for reasons unknown (a family curse maybe, or due to the severe inbreeding. )

I quite like the idea of fem Harry, especially for the plots I've come up with.

Thank you! :)
