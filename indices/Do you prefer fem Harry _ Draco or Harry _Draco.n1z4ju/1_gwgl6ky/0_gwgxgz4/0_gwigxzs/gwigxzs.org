Tom comes across to me as sexist at face value but it's really because the people he's grown up with let him be disparaging. He actually thinks most men (aside from himself) are equally useless as agents. He recognises society privileges men so as hench people they have more utility. It is sexist but nothing would be helped from pointing that out to him.
