I suppose, I'd honestly say though that the Wizarding World of the 90's is less prejudiced against women than the real world today. Gender seems to play no role at Hogwarts or in government. Half of all Ministers for Magic since the 19th century have been women. Amelia Bones is head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement until her death and replacement with a Death Eater. Out of the few named Aurors we know of, two are women: Tonks and Alice Longbottom. Women appear to participate in gender integrated sports, and have no discrimination for employment, taking high positions at Hogwarts (where they make up a representative percentage of faculty and staff) and in the Ministry.

  You could also write in the idea of males being perceived as true heirs, the children men from long lines, such as the malfoys, seek.

This is perfectly fine and extremely common in fanfiction, but the concept of Wizarding aristocracy is fanon. The only "heir" in canon is the Heir of Slytherin.

  I think you'd have to emphasise it in your writing.

I think it's more along the lines of inventing it. Which is, again, fine and extremely common in fanfiction today. It's also a bit glaringly obvious and out of place when I come across it. It's like inventing a problem so the author can soapbox about it, just not personally a fan.
