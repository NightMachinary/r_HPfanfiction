I think you'd have to emphasise it in your writing. I do agree that the wizarding world is fairly egalitarian but I think you can safely assume that if the WW is racist against blood, then it would definitely be sexist.

You could easily work in the lack of equal opportunity. Things such as how only 9 of 35 ministers of magic are female, the role quite a lot of women seem to take on in Harry Potter (being mothers and wives, which is not a bad thing, but there seems to be less of a focus on their careers and aspirations)

You could also write in the idea of males being perceived as true heirs, the children men from long lines, such as the malfoys, seek.
