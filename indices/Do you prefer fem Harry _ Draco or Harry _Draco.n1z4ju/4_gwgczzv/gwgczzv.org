I generally prefer harry/draco and if there is gender swap in the ship i gen prefer both so like fem harry/fem draco.

otheewise feels more like the gender got changed just to make it m/f instead of m/m which is just pointless imo. Though in gen I usually only like genderswap when changing the gender changes something about the character and how they interact with the world otherwise it seems kinda random.
