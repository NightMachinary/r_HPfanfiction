By pure curiosity, I you are ready to gender bend one of the character, why isn't fem! Draco on the table?

Concerning the favoured pairing, I think I prefer Harry/ Draco? I'm not a big fan of slash, but for some reason the girl ending up with the guy that abused years (or tried to) for years leaves a bad taste in the mouth , which is also one of the reason why I don't really like Hermione/ Draco). There is probably some unconscious sexism involved since a man experiencing the same thing bother me less but whatever.
