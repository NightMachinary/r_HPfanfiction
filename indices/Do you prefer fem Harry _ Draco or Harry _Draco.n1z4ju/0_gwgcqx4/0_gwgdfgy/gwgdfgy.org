Quite honestly, I've never actually considered writing female draco. I think perhaps it's because of a lack of fics with that ship? But now you've brought it up my mind is definitely whirring lol.

And yes, I do agree with you. It's why I hate any harry/Snape slash or dramione. I like any drarry slash, including gender bends, but I won't read it if it isn't eventual! Slash because again, like you said, suddenly falling in love with someone who was nasty to you for years is just icky.

Thank you for replying! You've definitely awoken that dusty fem!draco corner of my brain lol :)
