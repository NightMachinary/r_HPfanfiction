To be Honest, since i had the idea about Delphi pairing with anyone, the picture of her seducing Harry, Ron or their Children (sexually) to either corrupt them or destroy their family was tempting and i could only see her for this "Purpose". Sure, there is a way, that Harry adopting her to care for her, but such a Story would be Boring (didnt read cursed child, dont see it as Canon), maybe my "Older Man/Younger Woman" Mind is going crazy again.
