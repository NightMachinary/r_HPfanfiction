Have I got a /list/ for you! Some are ongoing while others are completed, and some are oneshots. I will put down which ones are oneshots and which are not. I'm linking them, since the fanfic bot is like, really bad at linking things, and has a limit which is very very sad. I will have to reply to this comment as well haha, since it won't allow me to link every single on of my recs on one comment. Anyway, here we go!
