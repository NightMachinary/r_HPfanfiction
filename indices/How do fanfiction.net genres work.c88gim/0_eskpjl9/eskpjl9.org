It helps if you ignore the genres of the original work and focus on the genres that relate to the specific plot you're writing. When people write HP fic, they usually don't label it “fantasy” because they didn't add any new fantasy elements, just used the ones already in the series.

If there's a focus on a pairing, definitely use the romance label.
