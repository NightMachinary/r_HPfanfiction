I think one issue is that a lot of people conflate genre with tropes in a fic. If, for example, a fic features an "arranged marriage" in a non-trivial manner it would generally be conflated in peoples' minds as a romance story. But what if it features other tropes, like say "OP main character" or "Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived?" Is it still a romance genre?

Maybe the best way to go forward is try to identify the tropes that are prominent in your fic, then consider where those usually belong. This is, admittedly, not a perfect methodology by any stretch. It may however help end the commentary about miscategorization from reviewers. If I am being honest though, I doubt it will end no matter what you do, short of not having any genre at all. Any change will be liked by some and disputed by others.

Best answer though is, this is trivial at best and you should focus on what you want your story to be, not what others want to label it. Its your baby, so to speak.
