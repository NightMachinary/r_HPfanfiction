I'm currently writing one called [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8724634/1/The-Snow-Queen][The Snow Queen]], an HP/HG (harry potter/ hunger games, ya doofuses) crossover fic. Expect everyone to be a bit OOC though. Ok, a lot OOC. And [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch]] by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/699762/The-Mad-Mad-Reviewer][the Mad Mad Reviewer]] is definitely the shit if you're into fem!Harry and time travel. Enjoy, my friend!
