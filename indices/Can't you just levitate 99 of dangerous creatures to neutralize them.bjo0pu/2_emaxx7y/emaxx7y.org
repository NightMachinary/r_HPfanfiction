I haven't done it in a Harry Potter fic, but this is one of my go-to strategies when I'm playing Dungeons and Dragons. It doesn't work all the time, but when you're able to simply levitate the big, strong mook, it's a great feeling. Completely takes them out of the fight.

Now that I'm thinking about it, while not exactly levitating the monsters, something similar is done in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][/Seventh Horcrux/]] by Emerald Ashes. Instead of fighting the troll (and other monsters), Harrymort just vanishes them. It's rather effective.
