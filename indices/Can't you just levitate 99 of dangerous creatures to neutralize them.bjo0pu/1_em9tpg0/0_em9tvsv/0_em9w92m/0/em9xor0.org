You should read Rot and Ruin. It's a post apocalyptic zombie book thing where they do things smart. People wear carpet to protect themselves from bites, bedrooms are locked from both sides so people can that die in their sleep can't escape and infect other people, because new zombies are smarter. Everyone carries slivers to sever the brainstem if they get a zombie stuck. They do zombie apocalypse smart, it's great.
