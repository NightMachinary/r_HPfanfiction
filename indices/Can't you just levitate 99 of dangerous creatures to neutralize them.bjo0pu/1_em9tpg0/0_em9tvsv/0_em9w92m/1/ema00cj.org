  Have you tried this before and tried to go about for a day? It can get annoying really quick.

  Have you tried doing some light sparring with this on? It tears off pretty easily unless you have a huge mass of tape that makes you pretty much immobile.

  Did you know that the sheering strength and tensile strength of most forms of denim fabrics used in work clothes are stronger than the scientific maximum bite strength of a human? Adding in socks, boots, gaiters, inner shorts, and kneepads and you basically have something that is more if not absurdly more effective protection that is purposely immune to rain, mud, cold, heat, and are more flexible.

  Also, what if you have to run through a stream? Screw that, what if it's raining?
