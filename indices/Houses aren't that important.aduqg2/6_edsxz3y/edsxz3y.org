In the long run? Yeah, I agree!

But in the short term (at school and immediately after school!)?

Yes, they are!

Why?

Simple:

You have the closest ties to your housemates! You might have some acquaintances in the other houses, but real friendships seem rare! (People were astonished about Lily and Snape for example!)

So for a Slytherin it would be great to call up some of his former housemates once he/she leaves school to help them find a job and the same goes for the other houses!

Still, after a few years that is probably where the usefullness of your house-ties becomes questionable, you probably will ask others regularly what house they were in (to learn if you knew them at school) but you will probably stop discriminating very very soon!

ps: Slytherins might get the most use out of their house-ties, because a lot of rich and well connected people seem to end up there and they probably help their own (especially since Slytherin really is discriminated against in Hogwarts, they aren't treated fairly - look at how Dumbledore ended first year, with the house cup!)! The other houses will probably end up falling back on house-ties far less than Slytherins!
