I don't enjoy traits being used as an identifier for the House right from the start. Because (if am not mistaken) you are sorted according to your values and preferences more than anything else. Hermione WANTED to be in Gryffindor. Neville VALUED courage. Neither was necessarily a representation of the House traits in the beginning. The House just provides an environment where those traits have a higher likelihood of being cultured.

So I think Houses are important. The sorting prophecizes the future character of a person with high reliability: you either posses already, want to poses or unwilling and unknowingly develop under the influence of peers certain qualities. Are there exceptions? Sure. Is House affiliation predicative of the kind of person you are? Yes, to a certain degree (allowing for changes that people undergo during lifetimes).
