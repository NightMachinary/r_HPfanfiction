I always wish people portrayed BOTH extremes of each house and everything in between instead of just hammering the obvious.

Gryffindors ranging from Selflessly Brave to Foolishly Brash. Hufflepuffs from Unwaveringly Loyal to Obnoxiously Naive/Fanatic Ravenclaws from Curiously Intelligent to Selfishly Nosy Slytherins from Endlessly Cunning to Treacherously Greedy.

And not just that, but a combination of traits with one of them being dominant.

Instead we usually get 11 year old "politicians" in Slyherin, know-it-all Ravenclaws and so on. People make the houses needlessly one dimensional, J.K Rowling is guilty of it too.
