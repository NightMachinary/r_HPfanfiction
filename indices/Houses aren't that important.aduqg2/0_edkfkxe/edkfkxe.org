I completely feel the same way. In canon, the only real characteristic that people repeatedly felt was either enforced or engendered by the House you were Sorted into was that Dark wizards came from Slytherin. That's what's driven home, over and over. Harry questioning his placement in Gryffindor is purely because he heard Parselmouth is connected with Voldemort and Salazar Slytherin himself.

Plus, it seems like half the characters defy their House's stereotype in some way. Crabbe and Goyle aren't very ambitious (until the Fiendfyre thing), Cedric is the perfect student, Hermione's the smartest, Justin spreads rumors, Pettigrew is a coward, etc.
