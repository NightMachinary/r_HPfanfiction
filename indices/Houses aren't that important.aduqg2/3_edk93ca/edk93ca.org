  Anyway, my point is that you don't need to point out that your characters are acting "so Gryffindor" or "so Slytherin" all the time. It's not enjoyable to read.

This is true, but to say that Houses are irrelevant is also wrong.

I think that the rivalry with the Slytherins and the overall dislike for them is not because they are Slytherins in a vacuum, but because with the exception of Pettigrew, all Death Eaters we know were Slytherins. You have people like Malfoy pulling shit without other Slytherins stepping in, Snape is an atrocious, bigoted teacher who abuses his power and later on half of Harry's year in Slytherin is at least sympathetic towards Voldemort. Most Slytherins are horrible people, with Andromeda as the only exception that we know of.

And since most people don't bother with fine distinctions, they'd say that Slytherin is evil and avoid them. The relationship between the other houses might be more akin to sports rivalries (there would still be gossip, banter and some jabs), but due to the War(s), Slytherin will be isolated and avoided by most students.
