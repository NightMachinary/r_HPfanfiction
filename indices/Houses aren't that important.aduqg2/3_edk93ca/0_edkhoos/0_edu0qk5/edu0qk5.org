I prefer not to begin these kinds of debates, but I just can't walk by.

We know next to nothing about Regulus. Saying that he is "good" is completely unjustified. From the little we know, we can deduce that he wasn't standing up for or supporting his brother since leaving him alone with their family wasn't a problem for Sirius, and Regulus was well liked by his parents. We do know that he didn't have much trouble fitting into a house where most people (at that time) supported or at least didn't mind a cultured but half-insane even then maniac planning to massacre and/or reduce to sub-human half the magical population. He also willingly served that maniac (for a time at least). And we know little about his actual motivations for trying to destroy the "very valuable thing to Voldemort" aka Horcrux. For all we know, he could have done out of spite or because he cared about his house elf. There's nothing in his final letter to Voldemort that would indicate disapproval of his goals or motives, only that "I [Regulus] face death in the hope that when you [Voldi] meet your match, you will be mortal again". No motive, only desire to see his opponent dead. No motive, no character judgement.

​

Same with Snape: there's no indication whatsoever that he did any of the "brave" or "good" things he did for anything other than selfish reasons such as to relieve guilt, self-preservation and keeping his word (aka stroking his pride as much as acting according to honor, depending on how you look at it).

​

I am not saying they were "bad". I am just saying that we can hardly discern they were "good". On a larger scale, I can't remember any Slytherin who is not acting according to selfish reasons (which is not a bad thing!). And as I view it, characteristics such as cunning, ruthlessness, or some such associated with the house stem from that (in varying degrees in different people, of course). And since historically people connotate "selfish" with "evil" Slytherin reputation is justified if unfair.

Also, my canon knowledge is rusty so I am probably wrong somewhere in this comment. Please, feel free to correct me.
