AFAIK, your canon statements are correct, I really like the thorough summary. I'd actually never considered Regulus's possible motives before.

I guess you could have moral philosophy debates all day about what "good" and "bad" here. The split between the consequences of your actions and the intentions behind them is one of the oldest debates in philosophy and I'm not about to solve it here. In my naming of Snape, Slughorn, and Regulus, I basically meant people who had taken action against Voldemort, regardless of intention. Other "good" actions by Slytherins are unknown because they weren't germane to the plot of the books. That's something fanfic has been great at delving into, expanding characters like Millicent Bulstrode, Adrian Pucey, Daphne and Astoria Greengrass, etc.
