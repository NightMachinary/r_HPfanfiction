Hmmm, let's see.

Maybe, just maybe you're getting down voted because you're suggesting it's okay to cause long-term damage to a classmate for no reason.

Montague once fouled Katie Bell, maybe this makes him a bit of an asshole but it's not a good justification.

He recruited Crabbe and Goyle as Beaters. Probably a questionable move but still, no justification.

He joined the Inquisitorial Squad. Okay, I can see where you're going here but keep in mind that he was shoved into the cabinet just after joining the Squad. He effectively did nothing to "aid a tyrannical rule". Whatever the Squad may or may not have done later has nothing to do with him. It certainly does not justify Fred and George scrambling his brain so badly that he was still in hospital 2 months later.

The only reason you think this is okay is because "hurr durr Slytherin evil". You quite effectively demonstrated what's wrong with the Hogwarts House system.
