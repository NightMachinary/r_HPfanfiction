No, my justification is not Slytherin is evil. His House Status is irrelevant, and in my eyes, Marietta would be an equally valid target after she betrayed the DA.

The argument is that Montague joined the woman who was torturing children for no apparent reason. A woman who sent Dementors after what can be considered a whistleblower in an assassination attempt in a small town. That's the kind of shit Russia gets its economy fucked over. It was very clear what kind of values Umbridge stood for. It was clear that she was sabotating the education of all students (other than maybe sacking Trelawney) and that she was helping Voldemort.

He was helping a woman who helped to get innocents killed through her "academic reforms", and that's not even mentioning the Muggleborn registration shit she would end up doing two years later.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEvyEM0JdSc][Here is what collaborators got in France after the war]]. And Umbridge was basically using the Third Reich as a masterplan for most of her acts, so the comparison is valid.

And if you think that Montagues injuries were bad and Fred&George were out of line, what do you say about Malfoy's attack on Katie, who had similar consequences (but was actually more than one war crime)?
