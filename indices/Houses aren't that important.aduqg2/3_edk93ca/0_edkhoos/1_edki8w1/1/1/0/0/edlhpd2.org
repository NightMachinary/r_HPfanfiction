  You're saying he deserved what he got because of what someone else did 2 years later.

No, I explicitly said that "and that's not even mentioning the Muggleborn registration shit she would end up doing two years later."

Montague knew Voldemort was back. Malfoy was bragging about it, Diggory was dead and the press was suddenly running a character assassination on Harry and Dumbledore after they proclaimed Voldemort's return. Harry had given his interview. The information was there.

People would have known about the torturous detentions. That's a rumour you cannot keep quiet. The whole DA would have seen the scars during their meetings. And I doubt that Harry and Lee were the only victims.

And the sabotage of an entire generation through substandard education is another matter which he would have known of. Which is a direct collaboration with Voldemort's goals.

  I'm sure he knew this group was being given unfair privileges, and he might have just not cared that he was being a dickhead by abusing the system.

So collaborators joining the SS was fine if they were just in for the privileges and not out of conviction?
