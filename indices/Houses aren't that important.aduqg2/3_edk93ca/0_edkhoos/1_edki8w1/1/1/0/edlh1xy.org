You're completely reaching. There's no evidence showing that Montague knew about any of this stuff and some of it even occurs in the future. You're saying he deserved what he got because of what someone else did 2 years later.

He effectively joined some sort of super-charged prefect group. I'm sure he knew this group was being given unfair privileges, and he might have just not cared that he was being a dickhead by abusing the system.

This does not provide a justification for his classmates to attack him, with the consequences being potentially permanent brain damage. You can disagree with me all you want, but this right here is why people are down voting you.
