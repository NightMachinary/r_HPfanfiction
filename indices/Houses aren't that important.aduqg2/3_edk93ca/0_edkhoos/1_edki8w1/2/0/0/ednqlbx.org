  And how many students lost their interest into Potions three lessons in
#+end_quote

you tell me. you can't, because you have no idea, because your claim is unsubtantiated. it's an inference. you say snape fucked the whole country: you have no proof

#+begin_quote
  And you are basically saying that it doesn't matter how bad a teacher is, independent study is a thing
#+end_quote

that isn't what i said, at all. i'm saying you have no evidence that snape's teaching yielded any significant negative outcome

also, umbridge was bad because, among other things, she didn't even teach DADA, and physically tortured the students. it's more likely that the methods/recipes snape gave the students were /more advanced/ given his genius, even if he was an asshole
