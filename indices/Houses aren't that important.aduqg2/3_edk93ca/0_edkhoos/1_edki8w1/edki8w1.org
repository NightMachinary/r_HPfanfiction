Fucked a whole country with his teaching methods and NEWT requirements. He also joined the Death Eaters, had a fascination with the Dark Arts and had shady friends. A good deed does not wash away a bad one.

Was aiding a tyrannical rule which tortured children. Any amount of force is suitable for that.
