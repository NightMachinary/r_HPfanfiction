  Fucked a whole country with his teaching methods and NEWT requirements. He also joined the Death Eaters, had a fascination with the Dark Arts and had shady friends. A good deed does not wash away a bad one.

I totally agree with you about Snape as a teacher, but honestly I blame Dumbledore more. Why didn't he do anything to stop Snape from abusing his power again? Also, choosing Snape as a Head of Slytherin was a terrible idea since he was obviously a bad role model.

The radicalization of Slytherin was at least partially Dumbledore's fault tbh.
