You're right, I should have clarified that houses aren't important--except Slytherin has a bad rap (kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy if nice people are all "not Slytherin!" to the hat, based on the reputation they hear).

There are other "good" Slytherins--Regulus and Snape both sacrificed their life to defeat Voldemort. And Slughorn is such an interesting character who has his follies but could not be called "evil" by most definitions.

Kids, realistically, are gonna be loyal to their friend group and not want to be outcasts. Dumbledore rewards Neville for standing up to his friends because it's so unusual and brave. Nobody in Gryffindor stopped the Weasley twins from giving Montague a brain injury, and that's worse than anything Malfoy managed to pull off. The Hufflepuffs all groupthink their way into hating Harry during CoS and GoF. Not like being cliquish is an exclusively Slytherin thing.
