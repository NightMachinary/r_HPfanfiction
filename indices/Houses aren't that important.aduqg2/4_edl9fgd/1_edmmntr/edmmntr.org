British schools do have houses. I suppose all commonwealth countries that follow the British system do (at least mine does). In my primary school, we had four houses - Red, Blue, Green and Yellow. But that was where it stopped.

In my secondary school which was catholic, we had house names like Lourdes, Loretto, etc. We had pledges, house colours, motto, house captains and the like. It was only ever important during PE class and sports day unlike Hogwarts however
