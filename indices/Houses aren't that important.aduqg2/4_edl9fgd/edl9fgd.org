Hogwarts doesn't have majors or clubs or frats, so the houses seem to take on the importance of those other social structures.

I always assumed they were based on the collegic residential college system, and not anything seriously used in a primary boarding school setting. Part of the whimsey of having more 'adult' structures in a wizarding school.

My experience with the California flavor of residential colleges is they mattered for naught but where you rested your head for the first year. Major and Department/School (major groupings, usually correlated to buildings) were much more important. As we're social clubs/sports. (Frats were banned, but I would imagine they would have been much the same). I would assume it is the same at the Universities the system was based on.

In fact, I would say having residential colleges that group by scholarly interest intensified those other scholarly (major/department) social ties more than being a thing themselves
