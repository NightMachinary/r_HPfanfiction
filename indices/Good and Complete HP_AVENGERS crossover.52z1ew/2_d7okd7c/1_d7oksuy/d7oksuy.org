Oh yes. I'm sorry! I guess I forgot because I don't normally read slash.. And to be very honest, out of the story's 90,000 words and 22 chappies, there are fewer than 10 scenes that have slash content. At its heart, I really experienced the story as more of an action/adventure epic than a romance.

But for those who prefer to avoid slash (my apologies!), there is a M/M rating at the top of each chapter.
