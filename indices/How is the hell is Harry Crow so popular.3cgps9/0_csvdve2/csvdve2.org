Robst has a niche of fans that have followed him forever. They seem to not mind that his characterization is the same in each fic. Even if Harry isn't raised by Goblins, he's still basically that Harry. The same is true for Hermione, Ron and the rest. Maybe that's so you don't have to think too much while reading one. Shrugs. If I read more than two chapters of his, I start to grind my teeth until my jaw hurts, lol. So, I've never been able to finish one of his stories, dental work is expensive.
