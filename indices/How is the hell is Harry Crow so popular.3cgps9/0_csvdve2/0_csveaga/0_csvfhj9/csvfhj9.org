Well, maybe that's part of it--low standards on the part of the readership. When I look at the epilogue chapter of that story, the phrase "grammatically well written" does /not/ come to mind--rather, I see a zillion run-on sentences and missing commas, even without knowing a single thing about the plot. On the two or three occasions on which I tried to read this story in the past, I closed the tab in disgust upon seeing the bad English in the very first chapter, because it utterly broke my immersion. People who even /read/ stories with substandard English--/regardless/ of the quality of those stories' plots--are part of the problem!
