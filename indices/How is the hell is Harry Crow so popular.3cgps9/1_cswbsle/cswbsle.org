/To actually answer the question/, rather than rant and kvetch, it's a feel-good fic where good things happen to good people, bad things happen to bad people, and all children are above average; and there's lots of it, so you can keep reading about yet another easy victory, yet another good thing happening to a good person, and yet another bad thing happening to a bad person.

Harmony love is instant and constant: Harry's personality is rewritten to be the perfect gentleman and a scholar (and an utter badass, of course), and Hermione's is stripped away so that all her thoughts and actions can properly revolve around Harry. There is no real tension, no real conflict, no sense of danger, except maybe some occasional peril for Hermione, so that Harry could be a proper Knight in Shining Armour for a chapter. This is not an uncommon pattern in romance generally written by male writers from the White Knight / Nice Guy school of relationships, as well as by female writers from the /Twilight/ school of relationships.

It's telling that all of the above also describes his newest long fic, /You're my Density/. The formula works.
