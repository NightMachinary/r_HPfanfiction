As someone who read and enjoyed all of the stories Robst has written, I find your post highly offensive. The idea that people are only allowed to like things you approve of makes you an elitist shitbag. You're as bad as the people who say nobody should ever read fanfic, and complain that we should just all read novels and grow up, because liking fanfiction at all must mean something is wrong with us. In fact, you're far, far worse, because as a part of the minority community of people who like fanfic at all, you should really know better than to attack other people for having tastes that aren't identical to yours. I could explain to you why I enjoy Robst, but you know what? I don't have to justify what I enjoy to you, or anyone else. Instead, I'll keep enjoying what I enjoy, and give you a hearty and emphatic "GO TO HELL!"
