I will admit I did enjoy it at first... But then dropped it for a long, long, long time...then decided to re-read it.

And it was...not good. I guess when I got into it originally, I could disregard the "beating someone over the head with personal philosophy" (I read Ayn Rand and loved the stories, at one point. Then went back and went "WOAH. How did I miss that?!" on another read.) but when I tried again, I noticed it more from the get go (I knew, roughly, what happened in all the chapters I read...so I saw things I didn't the first time around, I guess.)

Either way, I just couldn't do it. X.X
