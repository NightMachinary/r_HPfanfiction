No idea, but sadly I've read all of it just to have something to read.

I say sadly. It's honestly kind of one of those guilty pleasures, like "This is so terrible, objectively speaking. BUT I CAN'T STOP."

I mean, honestly, it's the only reason why I can kind of see why people like Methods of Rationality - either I can't understand their likes, which is fine, different strokes and all... Or they've already invested so much time reading it, or it's just a trainwreck they can't look away from.

And uh...do you have some recommendations for stories that barely get attention? >.> I'm out of new reads at the moment. :D

Edit: Thanks guys~!! These look fantastic, haha.
