[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux]] I'm not a fan of comedy fanfics but this is something amazing i tell ya.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2973799/1/]] Equal and opposite really amazing dark harry fic. Superb.

[[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=14151]] Out of the night is a really good one too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Boy_Who_Lived]] Of course the best other boy who lived fanfic ever written I like to think. But everyone knows it no doubt.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force]] Amazingly well done crossover with the star wars universe, the characters in it feel pretty right to me. I love the HK-47 in it, feels right to me anyway.

What I love about these fanfics is that harry is not OP and is not dark like all of a sudden, feels real at least in a fanfic anyway.

There are a couple more I think but these are really the top of the top of all the fanfics i've come across that to me stood really out as something special. They all have pretty low reviews compared the shit that is on top of the sites which to me is appalling, cause they keep reading crap and this amazing stuff get's unnoticed.
