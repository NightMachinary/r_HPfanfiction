I have written fanfiction in which I redeem Draco Malfoy, and I totally agree with you. I play with him because he's not Harry, whom I am a bit in awe of---he's a bit fiddly for me to manage. Draco seems more straightforward to me. And I was a teacher, and I know how brutal some kids can be, and then they grow up to feel wretched about it, or to mould it in their minds as having been different, but they are not vile baddies as adults. So a seventeen-year-old turd is not a turd for life. But doing a close, revisionist parsing of these books looking for St. Draco is more than I can bear. He is gleefully awful in the first four; in the last two he's no better but in over his head. That doesn't make him good; that makes him sympathetic to me only because as a teacher I had to care for all sorts of unlike-able kids.
