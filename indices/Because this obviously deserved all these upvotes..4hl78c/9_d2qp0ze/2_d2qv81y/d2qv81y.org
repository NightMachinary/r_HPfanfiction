  ‘You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.'

  He held out his hand to shake Harry's, and Harry took it.

  ‘Finally, someone worth talking to! Uncle Vernon told me all about making connections with the right people and avoiding the riff-raff,' he said warmly.
