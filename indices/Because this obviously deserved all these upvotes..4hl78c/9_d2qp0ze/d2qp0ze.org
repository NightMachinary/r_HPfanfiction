Have you never heard of the butterfly effect?

The smallest detail can always have the biggest change. Let's say that Harry did shake Draco's hand and they soon became close friends. Best friends, even. Harry would have had some influence on Draco regardless. He would have still been an asshole as people's personalities don't change. But I highly doubt he would have been such an open asshole. I'm sure if Draco learned that Harry was a Parselmouth and told his father, Lucius would be at Harry's feet as it was a trademark of the Dark Lord. Who knows? Butterfly effect. It's ridiculous to discredit the idea, as it has merit.

Also, OP, what gives you the right to bash someone like this? I swear this place was for sharing of fanfiction and ideas, not petty bashing.

Now, to look at your post in it's entirety.

"He's at his worst in the first three years"

What has OoTP got to do with that? The person CLEARLY said the first THREE years.

Third box.

What a great argument you provided. Clearly, the theory has some merit, but it's a movie thing and it has been somewhat adapted. It does make sense as Draco's character does seek after redemption. It does make sense, but I doubt that happened. I believe he just ripped the book because he could.

Fourth box.

The phrasing on this one is horrid, both by your and the person. Dumbledore did seek to 'help' Draco, but didn't seek him out.

Fifth box.

Addressed this one first. :)
