  Let's say that Harry did shake Draco's hand and they soon became close friends. Best friends, even.

How do you go from shaking hands to becoming friends... even best friends? They could never be friends. Can you even imagine if they tried to start a conversation after shaking hands? It couldn't last a minute:

Draco is literally a racist. He wants the mudbloods to die. He and his family are some of the closest supporters of Voldemort (you know, the insane murderer guy who killed Harrys parents). Not to mention that a person with an upbringing like Harry can't relate to an aristocrat like Draco at all: These things that Draco values mean nothing to someone like Harry.

  Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he says that it was all kept quiet and it'll look suspicious if I know too much about it. But I know one thing --- last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it's a matter of time before one of them's killed this time. ... I hope it's Granger,‚Äù he said with relish.

This is Draco Malfoy. How could Harry ever be friends with him? Unless you are thinking about fanon-Draco, who is an entirely different person. It isn't just the case that Harry wouldn't want to be friends with Draco, Draco also wouldn't want to be friends with Harry (and even if he wanted to, he still wouldn't because he listens to his father).

I'm sure Draco could be de-programmed and redeemed, but merely shaking hands or being nice to him and having a talk certainly will not do it.
