Hmm. Maybe it's only me that sees a handshake as a friendly gesture. Draco offered his hand in friendship. If Harry shook it, then that's what it would be, a friendship. As for best friends, you never know. Look at Ron and Hermione.

Putting the sins of the father on a child is worst thing you can ever do. Find me a paragraph where Draco has openly stated that he wants all Muggleborn students to die.

My mum's a homophobe, yet I'm not. It's amazing how children aren't perfect replicas of their parents. What amazing knowledge that I have never seen before. Who knew. Just because my mum hates gay people, doesn't mean that I will. The same applies in the scenario.

Draco was raised to be that way, even if it isn't mentioned, it's shown multiple times. Everything regarding Draco is father this and father that. Do you even think for a moment any of the asinine garbage Draco spat while a child was his own thoughts and beliefs?

Noooope.
