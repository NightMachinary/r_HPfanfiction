  Your standards for friendship seem a tad low. I shake hands with lots of people - most of whom I don't consider friends, barely acquaintances. I even shake hands with people that I don't like or consider my rivals - sometimes out of politeness, sometimes for other reasons.

No no no, all you have to do is shake hands with someone and you're 100% friends for life. This is why Tom Riddle grew up to be a completely sane, well-adjusted, benevolent and productive member of society after shaking Dumbledore's hand as an eleven-year-old.
