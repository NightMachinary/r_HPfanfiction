  Hmm. Maybe it's only me that sees a handshake as a friendly gesture. Draco offered his hand in friendship. If Harry shook it, then that's what it would be, a friendship.

Your standards for friendship seem a tad low. I shake hands with lots of people - most of whom I don't consider friends, barely acquaintances. I even shake hands with people that I don't like or consider my rivals - sometimes out of politeness, sometimes for other reasons.

  Putting the sins of the father on a child is worst thing you can ever do. Find me a paragraph where Draco has openly stated that he wants all Muggleborn students to die.

I just posted a quote where he is quite happy to see Muggleborns die. I think it's a fair extrapolation that it is something he desires in general.

  My mum's a homophobe, yet I'm not
#+end_quote

Good for you. How is that relevant? Draco /is/ a racist because he says racist things. Draco /became/ a racist because of his parents. Are you comparing yourself to Draco? Do you say homophobic things? If you do you should re-evaluate your claim that you aren't a homophobe.

  Draco was raised to be that way, even if it isn't mentioned, it's shown multiple times. Everything regarding Draco is father this and father that. Do you even think for a moment any of the asinine garbage Draco spat while a child was his own thoughts and beliefs?

Yes it's a pity and I sympathize with a child like this. It's not entirely his fault. Yet Harry is not the redeemer of humanity (especially not at age 11-12) who will try to save everyone, see the goodness in their hearts and try to befriend them in order to turn them from their evil ways. He will listen to Draco and see nothing but an asshole who wants bad things to happen to Harry's friends (bloodtraitors and mudbloods).
