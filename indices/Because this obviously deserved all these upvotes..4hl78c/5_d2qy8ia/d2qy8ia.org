I know that everyone says Draco isn't as bad in HBP but I completely disagree. You might pity him because he's being forced into a lot it but no one forces him to so recklessly try to kill Dumbledore and almost kill two other people in the process. He never shows any remorse over almost killing Katie or Ron so it always makes me wonder what people would say about him if he actually did kill either of them by mistake. I don't think everyone would be as quick to redeem him
