Harry discovered a hidden talent the summer after his first year. With his wand and books and broom locked away in his old cupboard, Harry found himself with a distressingly large amount of time on his hands (you know, when he wasn't tending to the garden or mowing the grass or washing Uncle Vernon's car or cooking or dodging his whale of a cousin or... well, you get the point)

He found a ball in the back of his wardrobe, which was filled more with Dudley's broken old toys than Harry's own clothing (which, incidentally, also happened to be Dudley's old clothes too). He figured his cousin wouldn't miss them. Besides, he had to keep his quidditch skills sharp. So he began tossing it in the air as he lay in bed at night. It was a nice, repetitive movement that helped him relax at the end of a long, labour filled day.

Then that blasted elf came and mucked things up and Harry was locked in his room with nothing, not even chores, to distract him. Tossing the ball quickly lost its novelty. Until he found the second one. And the third. With nothing else to do, Harry decided he would teach himself to juggle. And to his surprise, he was quite good at it. Like catching a snitch, jiggling was as easy as breathing, his eyes easily tracking each balls movements. And when that became too easy, he added more balls. When he ran out of those, rolled up socks were tossed into the mix. By the end of summer, Harry was able to juggle 7 things simultaneously.

He never told anyone this. Though there was that one Christmas in his 6th year involving a mistletoe, Professor Snape, and a whole lot of fire whiskey. But we won't talk about that.
