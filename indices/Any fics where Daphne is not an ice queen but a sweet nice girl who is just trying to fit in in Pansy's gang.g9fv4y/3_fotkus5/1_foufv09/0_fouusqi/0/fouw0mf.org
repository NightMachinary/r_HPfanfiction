In most of the fics I see the term in, it's not like that. In fact, if she's important enough in the story to have the nickname used, she usually gets a lot of characterization that either explains it or expands on it - it's a summary but not a shortcut.

It probably helps that I filter out as many bashing-tropes as I possibly can, so I don't actually see the connection between the "Ice Queen Daphne" nickname and "OMG Dumbledore's a manipulative bastard, Ron's a greedy pig, and Slytherin is probably good".
