The correlation is more that a lot of aristocratic/Lord Potter stories are badly written and bash Dumbledore/Ron, and they have an overlap with the stories that have him getting together with a pureblood Daphne/why there's a 'good' faction of purebloods.

It makes it so that there are a lot of fics that have him getting together with Daphne while bashing the other characters - but there's a lot of fics that don't have Daphne in it that also have that bashing, so it's not at all restricted. I could see how someone exposed only to fics where they're put together could think of them as connected.
