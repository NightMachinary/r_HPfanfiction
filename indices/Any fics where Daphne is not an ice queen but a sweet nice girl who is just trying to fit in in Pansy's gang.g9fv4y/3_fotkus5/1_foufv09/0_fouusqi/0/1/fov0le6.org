I get what you're saying. I will also mention though that I struggle to see anyone ever calling someone that as a nick name. This is coming from someone who went to British-South African boarding school, an international school, and two American high schools.

I could readily see a lot more negative ones (ie stuck up bitch, bitchy, offish, awkos, bint, arrogant something, a â€˜Princess' (as in sensitive or stuck up) ect ect. Or perhaps a few less harsh ones around her being timid/shy/too cool. Ice queen though? Eh. Just breaks immersion for me. Which is probably why I categorise it with a lot of bashing fics, super tropes, ect.
