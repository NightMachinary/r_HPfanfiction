I should have clarified... I would prefer canon compliant characters... but since Daphne is in essence an OC, often associated with the description of 'ice queen', I would prefer to see something different. As a matter of fact I wouldn't mind even a self-insert that instead of being a heart breaking ice queen, is a nice sweet but, overall, normal girl with her flaws and insecurities.
