At this point, it's a pretty common fanon nickname - and its usage doesn't force bashing Ron or manipulative Dumbledore.

The advantage it has is that it explains why Daphne is not really mentioned along with anyone ('Ice Princess' = standoffish), and because there's an appeal to having someone with a harsh first glance/attitude, but defrosting over the course of a story/with a heart of gold/whatever other cliche term we might want to use. It helps to put her in her own category within Slytherin, without having to go along with the overt racism of the prominent members of the house that we see in canon - while still being important.

It's also a characteristic that we don't really have in Hogwarts, so now that it's become somewhat fanon for Daphne, it's the logical choice for someone who wants to have a character with that outlook.
