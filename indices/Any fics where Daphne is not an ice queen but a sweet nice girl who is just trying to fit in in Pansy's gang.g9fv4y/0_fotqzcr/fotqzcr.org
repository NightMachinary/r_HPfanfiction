Daphne isn't an ice-queen in the same way she normally is. She's actually pretty sweet, but she has a lot of trouble expressing herself, reading social cues and understanding other people. That earns her the reputation of "ice queen", which she doesn't like.

I find her depiction in this one-shot very close to some cases of autism - and I say that as someone who's on the autism spectrum themselves.
