Linkffn(10937871) Blindness has Harry who has expert control of his magic and manipulates Fiendfire. He also has a deep connection to the Hallows, regularly wearing the cloak.

Linkffn(9704180) "I'm Still Here" by kathryn518 has Fiendfire shenanigans, specifically [[/s][using legilimency to take control of wild fiendfire]]

linkao3(4413323) A Big Happy Weasley Family has the Hallows messing with Harry's mind and making him more aggressive... it is also pure smut. But the final chapter does resolve the Hallows story in a way I wish someone else would borrow.

Linkffn(11669575) For Love Of Magic has Butifly shields and a host of other inventions, although the story takes a while to ramp up. Harry is way into Nietzschean philosophy in this one so take that as it is. There is smut but it's mostly story related smut.

Linkffn(9036071) With Strength of Steel Wings seems to fit the request, although it's been a while.

Linkffn(11585823) The Art of Self fashioning has a Harry who is super into transfiguring himself. The catch is that you lose elements of your humanity as you alter yourself. Like how Pettigrew looks very rat-like after so many years as a rodent, just turned up to eleven.

Not sure which ones are complete. I hope you find something you like.
