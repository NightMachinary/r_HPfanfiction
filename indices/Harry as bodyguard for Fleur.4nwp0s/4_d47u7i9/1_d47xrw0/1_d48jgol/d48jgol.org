Sorry, I was on my phone typing this during lunch and didn't click your comment to reply. It was mostly directed at you, yes. So be confused no longer. Let's take this one at a time. I'm going to do my best to take information from the books only, but mistakes happen. And this is as best as I can remember/google, so feel free to correct me.

  In any case, I think you've ODed on indy!Harry fics, because you're arguing from a position of 'should have' with Harry's power, rather than what we actually see of him.
#+end_quote

During OotP, Hermione said "You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can't." According to Hermione he has power, so I haven't completely ODed yet.

I also want to point out you were arguing from a position of "'hot older girl' fantasy (why 90% of Fleur/Harry exists), and ofc women need to be protected, and men are protectors, so screw making sense. A penis does not make you an effective bodyguard". You were implying that the remaining 10% of Fleur/Harry stores come from the Penis making you a bodyguard. I'm merely arguing that by claiming this you are committing the same misconduct you are blaming others of.

  Point is, he's not hot shit either. He scrambles from situation to situation, lucking out so often that some people practically think Harry has the ability to synthesise Felix Felicis at the cost of his wits. You mention 'gillyweed', a notable point where Harry just got lucky because the plot said so, and him being able to compete at all in the second task was entirely down to author contrivance (aka 'luck' in universe).
#+end_quote

I didn't say he was "hot shit". In fact I said the complete opposite, that Harry was a "namby-pamby teenager who literally let Hermione do everything!" I completely agree that he got lucky and had outside help. And just for your general fund of knowledge when an author writes an unexpected power or event, saving a seemingly hopeless situation, especially as a contrived plot device in a play or novel, is called a deus ex machina.

  The 'over 100 dementors' thing is usually dredged up in uber!Harry fics to try to make their ridiculous powerups seem more canonically sound. It does not, in fact, make them more believable in my opinion.
#+end_quote

Again from OotP, Ron is trying to convince the others to join the DA, "Third year, he fought off about a hundred Dementors at once." I'll grant it's Ron and probably exaggerated, but even doubled that is still 50+ Dementors. In PoA we know there are enough Dementors to surround the school. It is presented to us as if there are enough there that Sirius can't sneak in (and Harry can't sneak out). Given the sheer size of the Hogwarts grounds, at least 50 - 100 seems like a not unreasonable number.

#+begin_quote
  The implication was that any patronus could do this, but Harry being able to do it was impressive because he was young, and the spell was difficult, not because his was particularly powerful.
#+end_quote

Where in the books was this implied? In Deathly Hallows, during the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry, Ron and Hermione are attacked by "A hundred dementors" "advancing, gliding toward them, sucking their way closer to Harry's despair, which was like a promise of a feast...", "Ron's silver terrier burst into the air, flicker feebly, and expire; he saw Hermione's otter twist in midair and fade". Then "a silver hare, a boar, and a fox soared past Harry, Ron, and Hermione's heads: The dementors fell back before the creatures' approach." (*note that 3 patronuses (patroni??) couldn't force back the dementors*) And then Harry gets in gear and sends out his own patronus, "It cantered forward, and now the dementors scattered in earnest, and immediately the night was mild again." So 3 patronuses could barely force back the dementors, but Harry's makes them "scatter in earnest".

#+begin_quote
  I note that you ignore Fleur charming a dragon to sleep in order to hype Harry's ability to outfly one (flying being his main talent, for the record).
#+end_quote

Honestly, I just didn't think of it, but thanks for bringing it up (I was eating lunch). Yep, she did manage to charm the dragon. But this isn't some kind of talent of hers, at least not that we know of. Fleur has had since Hagrid's date to prepare for the Dragon match. It could be some kind of powerful charm only someone powerful could do, but it could just as easily be a simple charm like the Conjunctivitis curse, remember Sirius was telling Harry to use a simple charm (the Conjunctivitis curse, in fact) and Cedric used, transfiguration to distract the dragon. We're not told how complex it is turning a rock into a dog, but according to the Harry Potter Companion a 6th year would work on human transfiguration. I would think this is more difficult than what Cedric did.

  The 'power the Dark Lord knows not' is love, in canon. That's literally it. Voldemort is incapable of love, and Rowling wanted to make a rather shallow point about caring for your fellow man.
#+end_quote

Nope sorry. It is never stated in canon that love is the power. Dumbledore thought it was love, a power studied down in the department of mysteries. And in the end Voldie was killed by the Elder Wand...backfiring? Punishing him for trying to use the Killing Curse against it's master? So Harry's power over Voldie, was his knowledge of wandlore. Voldie couldn't kill harry with the wand in the forest and couldn't silence everyone at Hogwarts, because he wasn't the Master and the wand wouldn't work for him. What's Love got to do with it? Harry going into the forest, literally accomplished nothing other than to cause anguish to his friends.

#+begin_quote
  No, this does not automatically entitle Harry to be the 'most awesome wizard since Ahmenotep', because those plots are usually boring as sin and full of pandering to fifteen year old power fantasies, in my experience. 'Harry is a super special awesome wizard who is more powerful than Ahmenotep and protects a hot french girl in his spare time.
#+end_quote

I didn't say that Love should "automatically entitle Harry to be the 'most awesome wizard since Ahmenotep'". I said the prophecy says Harry should be powerful (obviously I'm wrong, the prophecy says *A* power. And as I pointed out above it was, apparently, wandlore.

#+begin_quote
  No, he is totally not a namby-pamby who needs to rely on a girl, ugh.' I don't know about you, but I don't see anything immature about this line of thinking. The subtext kinda speaks for itself, sorry.
#+end_quote

I didn't say he needed to rely on "a girl". I said he had to rely on Hermione. Unlike Ron, I recognized she was a girl from our first meeting with her. My point was exactly what I said, "Harry had to rely on Hermione." Harry Potter, the protagonist, the main character, *the CHARACTER WHOSE NAME IS IN THE TITLE OF EVERY BOOK*, could not effectively do anything beyond the basics from the classes he didn't sleep through. It was Hermione, a supporting character, who could brew any potion, memorized every book and spell, could figure out logic puzzles, create Mary Poppins' bottomless bag, set up wards, etc. If the books had been set up with Harry as nothing more than a [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425061/][Maxwell Smart]] and his trusty (read: competent) side kick 99, then fine, maybe it would have been funny.

And you assigning to me sexist notions "who needs to rely on a *girl*", is proving my original point, that you are showing your own sexism. Perhaps you should take a look at your self? It's called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection][psychological projection]] when humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others.

Namby-Pamby: lacking energy, strength, or courage; feeble or effeminate in behavior or expression. I was specifically going with the meaning: "lacking in energy" and "feeble in behavior" both of which Harry unarguably represents. He did nothing to prepare for the Horcrux hunt, for instance. Hermione, on the other hand, is definitely not displaying either of those traits.
