Okay, my point about 90/10 split of Fleur/Harry fics being older women fantasy was hyperbole. I was being snarky at the time, so yes, using it as an actual statistic would be stupid, I agree. I apologise for being sexist initially, but I'm so sick of 'white knight' fics that turn female characters into bland, personality-free objects to be protected, so I was blowing off a bit of steam in that direction, my bad. My intention was to equally parody the treatment of 'bland love interest to be protected' and 'expendable bland meat chunk who protects her', because the sexism of rescue romance really does cut both ways. Of course there are Fleur/Harry stories besides 'older woman fetish and bodyguard penis fics', because not every Fleur/Harry uses this particular set of tropes, but my point was that this plot comes across as pretty heavy on those, imo, using hyperbole as a rhetorical device. I actually like Harry/Fleur, believe me. They seem like a solid fit, personality wise.

Regarding patroni, I admit that my knowledge of Deathly Hallows isn't up to snuff. I only read the damned thing once in its entirety, and I didn't particularly enjoy the experience, so the fact that 'a hundred dementors' showed up again is a nice reminder, thanks. Callback to PoA or Rowling reusing rhetorical devices? You decide! And yes, that's a fairly standard 'hero shows up and the hopeless fight becomes winnable' trope, so I'll give you that one. (Edit: upon re-reading the section you quoted, the Dementors were already falling back from the reinforcing patronuses which you mentioned. Harry's is the tipping point, because he's the main character, and it's symbolic damn it) The point where he uses it in Prisoner of Azkaban, on the other hand, is powerful, but at no point are we expected to believe that Harry's patronus is above the norm. If it later turns out to be the case, I'd see it more as an oddity of Harry's character than an indicator that he's the magical equal of Imhotep. Not saying he /shouldn't/ be powerful, but it seems like you confuse who Harry is in canon with who you think he ought to be.

So I don't know, it seems like Harry does become more personally 'special' in later books (OotP-DH), but never in a particularly meaningful way beyond his Plot Armour. He squanders any natural talent he has for things that could be useful for the plot, and doesn't really display much competence in areas outside of his DADA and flying, so... what are we working with, really? He's hyped in universe, and has been from book one, but his 'power he knows not' is underwhelming at best. He's very decidedly average outside of a few specific areas. You argue that this should not be the case. Honestly, given the opportunity, do you really think he'd put the effort in? Does he, as a character, have the drive to become the character you'd want, during his teen years? In light of his inability to prepare for future situations (as you noted with comparison to Hermione), general laziness, and mediocrity in areas outside of DADA/Flying? I don't think it's at all likely for him to apply himself in the way you expect. He'd lean on Hermione for help, and she'd do most of the work, unless you change something rather fundamental to Harry.

Like... honestly, I get the feeling that the main reason you're arguing that Harry should be more powerful is directly because he's the main character, and you prefer a competent main character. And everything else is window dressing to that point, really. He's not the character you wanted him to be, and you feel cheated. That's... perfectly understandable. I feel the same way about canon, for reasons I detailed above, and yes, Harry is underwhelming in canon. However, using his few shining moments in canon to try to justify that gut feeling that 'Harry should have been more awesome' is a mistake, I feel. He has a few cool moments in canon, yes, but not enough that I think making him a fourteen-year-old mercenary is at all believable, even for a minute. Changing him into /that/ really necessitates an AU. I feel that his lack of appreciable power/talent in the series is fairly intrinsic to his personality as presented. He needs to have a personality shift, with different habits and maybe even different talents, in order to be the person you want him to be. So if Harry was more powerful, applied himself, and had talent for a few things outside of DADA, I could maybe see it happening, yes. It would take a talented author to get me to read it, because I've seen way too many awful fics with a premise that started like that, but it's doable, certainly.

The problem with the bodyguard thing is that while having Voldemort after him might (with changes, and a considerable amount of pushing) make him a capable combatant, the fact that he has someone powerful after him makes him a poor choice for a bodyguard. As in, you, as the person hiring him, now have to worry about becoming collateral to Voldemort's attempts to kill Harry. So... you either need to hire a different bodyguard (unacceptable, we want bodyguard Harry as a premise), or somehow mitigate the fact that there is a powerful madman who wants Harry dead, and might just put your head on a pike for associating with him. Well, it's already an AU, so... what if Voldemort never rose to power, or was perma-killed in Godric's Hollow? That neatly removes the issue of Harry being an enormous liability, but one still has to wonder who/what Fleur would need protecting from, particularly the absence of Voldemort. I agree with the traits you assign her for her canon appearances, and she's largely an unknown, but since she's not really anything special... why would she need a hypercompetent bodyguard? So you need to invent a new villain, too, and make him/her hate Fleur far more than they do Harry, taking focus away from him again. So really, it will be Fleur's story, as told by Harry, her bodyguard, because the core conflict has to revolve around her character rather than his in order for the concept to make any sense. I get the feeling that this focus on Fleur would not be what you want, because you want hypercompetent Harry to be the main character and focus of the series. The hoops one needs to jump through to get this plot off the ground in a believable fashion are quite numerous. Not an insurmountable challenge to write, but far more difficult to pull off than the reverse.

Consider this. The Order post guards around Harry when he's staying in Privet Drive. Fleur is a member of the Order, possibly via the Weasleys depending on how you feel about that. She takes the short straw, or loses a hand of wizarding poker to Mundungus, or anything of that nature, and suddenly she has to spend (at least) one night a week watching out for Harry. He's very slightly more curious than in canon (i.e. not played by Keanu Reeves) and the fact that he's stuck there with nobody to talk to bothers him enough to actually do something stupid, as Harry is often wont to do when he doesn't think things through enough. She has to stop him, physically, because his plan was dumb enough that it might just work, and he recognises her from GoF, so they end up talking when it's her turn to watch over him... wow, that's actually incredibly simple. It requires the barest modicum of changes, such as maybe moving Fleur's association with the Order forward a year, and making Harry more assertive, but it fits quite well. Harry could even be naturally more talented than her at stuff, in a raw, unrealised fashion, but he's not a member of the Order, so her position as his bodyguard has nothing to do with her personal power. She just happens to know some people who shanghaied her into protecting Harry, and Harry does not have working inroads with those people. So you can have Harry start to be awesome, and maybe Fleur helps him with that, and sparks fly where they may. Together, they fight Voldemort, who exists in this universe. Harry's personal conflict remains central, as he is the one being protected from bad things. Have your cake and eat it.

This is the crux of my issue with the suggested concept of bodyguard Harry/Fleur. I, personally, find the latter far easier to believe than the former. Not because Fleur has a vagina, or because I think Harry should be stronger, but because it requires a lot fewer contortions of the established characters to get Fleur as Harry's bodyguard to work.
