  So while Harry may be the main character, I would argue that him becoming a capable bodyguard before 14 is far less believable than Fleur being assigned to guard him, regardless of her personal badassery. Because his age and unique circumstances (I.e the enmity of Voldemort) make him much more likely to be in need of a guard, and she was part of the Order, whose job for most of the latter books was to guard Harry. So Fleur pulling protection detail for Harry is vastly more believable than Harry somehow acquiring the skills to protect Fleur... and her needing significant amounts of protection.

Perfectly acceptable answer. I was arguing that as the main character, who is under the influence of a prophecy that says he "will have a power the dark lord knows not", makes more sense to be a guardian, than a character we know: is 3 years older than Harry; likes bouillabaisse; is part Veela (at least 1/4); has a lust allure; can charm a dragon to sleep, can't beat grindylows; has a younger sister; is working for the goblins to improve her English; loves and marries Bill Weasley; fights at the Battle of Hogwarts.

That's what we know about her. To me it doesn't add up to an obvious Xena: Warrior Princess. In canon, as you yourself point out, it's only her age that makes her more likely to be in charge of protecting Harry than vice-versa. I've read several powerful!Fleur stories (The Lie I've Lived, comes to mind), admittedly she's usually a supporting character, but we know so little about her she could be a total kickass and we wouldn't know it.

I also argue, again fully admitting I've read and enjoyed many indy!powerful!Harry stories, that Harry having a madman after him argues he should be more likely to be the guard. In my opinion, any competent guardian (I'm looking at Dumbledore here) would have ensured Harry was getting some serious education, if not before Hogwarts (so he could enjoy his "childhood"), than at least once he was at school, and failing that, once Voldie was back, and has made it obvious he is still after Harry, there should have been constant tutoring, etc., if only so Harry could better run away.

  And yes, a male bodyguard is the stereotype, and it plays directly into the stereotypes surrounding the 'rescue romance' trope, to which the bodyguard romance is strongly related. You know, white knight, princess, that whole caboodle? Arguing that those stories aren't culturally biased by gender would be... really, really dumb. So yes, to some extent, it's because he has a dick. It's probably not the only reason, and it was my mistake to speak as if it was, but it's an important point to mention.

The trope is stereotyped as a male bodyguard. Not arguing that. I'm arguing that you ascribing to these authors a sexist attitude, "A penis does not make you an effective bodyguard", as if they have written Harry bodyguard stories because "ofc women need to be protected, and men are protectors" is wrong. That the authors were merely familiar with the trope and wrote what they knew. They have no intention of saying a penis "makes you an effective bodyguard" or that "ofc women need to be protected, and men are protectors." That they made Harry the protector, and not the protectee, because of the reasons I said above (Harry is the main character, has a "power", Fleur is older, but mostly unknown).

  TL;DR: you had some good points, but I strenuously disagree with your conclusions.

My points had a basis in canon. Feel free to disagree, but please backup your opinions with facts.
