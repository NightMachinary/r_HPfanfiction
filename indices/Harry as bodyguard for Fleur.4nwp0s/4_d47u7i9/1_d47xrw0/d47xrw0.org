Uh... was this directed at me? Because I was the one who posted about gender roles and Harry's penis and such, not OP, but you didn't actually reply to me directly, so now I'm confused. It reads like a reply to my post, so I'll treat it as such.

In any case, I think you've ODed on indy!Harry fics, because you're arguing from a position of 'should have' with Harry's power, rather than what we actually see of him. Point is, he's not hot shit either. He scrambles from situation to situation, lucking out so often that some people practically think Harry has the ability to synthesise Felix Felicis at the cost of his wits. You mention 'gillyweed', a notable point where Harry just got lucky because the plot said so, and him being able to compete at all in the second task was entirely down to author contrivance (aka 'luck' in universe). The 'over 100 dementors' thing is usually dredged up in uber!Harry fics to try to make their ridiculous powerups seem more canonically sound. It does not, in fact, make them more believable in my opinion. The implication was that any patronus could do this, but Harry being able to do it was impressive because he was /young/, and the spell was difficult, not because his was particularly powerful. I note that you ignore Fleur charming a dragon to sleep in order to hype Harry's ability to outfly one (flying being his main talent, for the record).

The 'power the Dark Lord knows not' is love, in canon. That's literally it. Voldemort is incapable of love, and Rowling wanted to make a rather shallow point about caring for your fellow man. No, this does not automatically entitle Harry to be the 'most awesome wizard since Ahmenotep', because those plots are usually boring as sin and full of pandering to fifteen year old power fantasies, in my experience. 'Harry is a super special awesome wizard who is more powerful than Ahmenotep and protects a hot french girl in his spare time. No, he is totally not a namby-pamby who needs to rely on a /girl/, ugh.' I don't know about you, but I don't see /anything/ immature about this line of thinking. The subtext kinda speaks for itself, sorry.

So while Harry may be the main character, I would argue that him becoming a capable bodyguard before 14 is far less believable than Fleur being assigned to guard him, regardless of her personal badassery. Because his age and unique circumstances (I.e the enmity of Voldemort) make him much more likely to be in need of a guard, and she was part of the Order, whose job for most of the latter books was to /guard Harry/. So Fleur pulling protection detail for Harry is vastly more believable than Harry somehow acquiring the skills to protect Fleur... and her needing significant amounts of protection.

And yes, a male bodyguard is the stereotype, and it plays directly into the stereotypes surrounding the 'rescue romance' trope, to which the bodyguard romance is strongly related. You know, white knight, princess, that whole caboodle? Arguing that those stories aren't culturally biased by gender would be... really, really dumb. So yes, to some extent, it's because he has a dick. It's probably not the /only/ reason, and it was my mistake to speak as if it was, but it's an important point to mention.

TL;DR: you had some good points, but I strenuously disagree with your conclusions.
