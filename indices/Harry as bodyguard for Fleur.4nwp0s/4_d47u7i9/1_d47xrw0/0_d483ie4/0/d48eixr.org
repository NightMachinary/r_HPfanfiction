Cheers, throwy :)

The big question I come away with from all of this is 'Why the fuck are we talking about Ahmenotep?' I mean, is there some big fanfic I missed in which one of the Ahmenoteps (there are four, technically) was a powerful wizard, to which this guy is referring? The one that people are most likely to know of was Ahmenotep IV, aka Akhenaten, sole prophet of the sun god, Aten. He's the father of modern monotheism, in many respects (Christianity rips him off wholesale), but there's nothing really supernatural about him beyond the usual myths surrounding a dead Pharaoh (and most of them got this treatment), so I'm left really confused by that angle of the conversation.

Seriously, wtf. Please help me out here?
