In what way? I said "he should have been" amazing. The prophecy does say "he will have power the Dark Lord knows not", right? Unless his "power" was Hermione saving his butt, we only got glimpses of power: his wand reaction , performing the Patronus, and sending dementors scurrying.

During OotP Hermione said "You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can't." So according to Hermione he has power, but beyond those two examples, we don't ever get to see it that I recall.

I don't deny that I've read and really like the Indy!Harry or powerful!Harry genre. But I do argue that it is canon and should have been more obvious.

He doesn't have to be Superman, but asking for Spider-man shouldn't be too much. We got [[http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Phillip_Coulson_(Earth-199999][Phil Coulson]]), a hero, but someone without power.
