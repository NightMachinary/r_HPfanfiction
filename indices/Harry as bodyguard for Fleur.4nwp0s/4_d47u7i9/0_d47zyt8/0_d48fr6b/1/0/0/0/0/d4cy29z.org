No, read it again. I'm saying that the stuff about 'power he knows not' and 'mark him as an equal' isn't a portent of Harry's impending awesome if it's used as a cheap plot device to get the villain into a conflict with the hero. Harry is billed as the 'dark lord's equal' and all that stuff because if that wasn't there, Voldemort would have no reason to go after Harry. Harry is some pissant half-blood who is mediocre at most things, and Voldemort would not give even a quarter of a rat's ass about fighting him if not for the prophecy. And then we would not have a plot. The end.

So Harry is reasonably normal, but has to survive the enmity of a powerful madman (read: a conflict with a clear underdog), and the justification for this in canon is talk of mysterious power and such, which Voldemort believes implicitly. Divination may even be mostly horseshit, we don't know, but the important part is that Voldemort believes it, and is willing to drop everything to go after Harry. Which is exactly what Rowling wanted. It's not hinting that Harry has the potential to be uberpowerful and the equal of Imhotep and such and such that you think he should be capable of. I think you've already reached that conclusion, and are trying to use canon to justify it after you've already decided. You've decided 'powerful Harry is what I want to see, now what evidence can I find?', at which point you might as well stop looking at canon, because what it says doesn't matter anymore. You've already made up your mind what you want it to say, and will see whatever you want to see from it.

Basically, I think you're trying to rationalise your adult dislike for the themes of the Potter books with the nostalgia you still feel for them. Hence why you espouse the idea that Harry should have been more awesome, yet cling to his actions in canon as a justification of that, despite saying that his actions in canon made him a namby-pamby teenager who can't do anything without Hermione. Can you not see how relying on canon Harry while dismissing it at the same time is contradictory argument? It's a cherrypicking argument at best, because anything that backs up your position is 'see! See! I told you he was awesome' and anything that works against it is 'see! I told you he relies on Hermione too much!'

Eh, there's a difference between the blood protection on Privet Drive and the one that Harry's mother gave him. The latter was the result of a powerful, willing sacrifice (and should therefore crop up significantly more often than in canon, yes). Harry's 'death' in DH was meant to be a big, heroic sacrifice for the people fighting there, so he gave them all protection, because 'it's magic, I don't gotta explain shit' (and because Christian subtext).
