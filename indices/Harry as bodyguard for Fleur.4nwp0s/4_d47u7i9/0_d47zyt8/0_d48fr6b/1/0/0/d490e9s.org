I get that you are frustrated with the lack of payoff for the omens and weirdness that surround Harry vs Voldemort, but in truth, they're at least partly there to justify the conflict in the first place. Harry isn't the chosen one because he's awesome, but because that plot device was needed to give Voldemort a reason to go after him in the first place. Otherwise Harry is some random half-blood who has no reason to personally fight Voldemort, and whom Voldemort has no reason to personally hate.

Y'know what could have worked, if in a more adult context than childrens' books like Harry Potter? Hermione Granger dealing with the fact that she inadvertently becomes a symbol for competent, hard-working muggleborns during Voldemort's return, assuming that whole 'kill-the-muggles' thing was given more depth. It could deal with her subsequent conflict with a group of murderers in particular, and a corrupt society as a whole, both of which would like nothing better than to stamp her into the dirt, if not kill her outright. She has reason to be in immediate conflict with both, and this plot requires no prophecies, vague incantations, omens or characters playing chess in the background to justify that conflict. It could make allegory to social issues, and give some idea how magic works, while still being largely about a normal (if brainy) girl who is in way over her head, yet who rises to the occasion. Honestly, barring the existence of the prophecy, you would think that a muggleborn like Hermione would have far more reason to be in ideological conflict with Voldemort than Harry ever did. Harry is fighting in the spirit of dead parents he never knew and was never particularly curious about, against a guy who wants to kill him for initially unexplained (and later not very compelling) reasons. Our hypothetical Hermione's conflict is, by comparison, immediately understandable, and also more complicated if one delves into the reasons behind the anti-Muggle sentiment in wizarding society. If she doesn't fight, she and her entire family will most likely die, or at least live a life of horrible suffering, for the crime of existing.

Either way, it's a damned shame the books weren't better, but at least we still have fanfiction.
