  the omens and weirdness that surround Harry vs Voldemort, but in truth, they're at least partly there to justify the conflict in the first place

So, what you're saying is, the canon material doesn't count, because it is canon? Because that's honestly what I get from your first paragraph.

The books were fine for Young Adult literature, although I think the editing fell off later in the series. As adults we're going to have issues with things. For example: As adults, we find out someone is trying to kill us, we're going to figure out why and hopefully do something to defend ourselves: Self-defense training, running the heck away, something!

My editing issues in the books are the problems any series would have. At a certain point mistakes start cropping up because the author is too close to the work. They have written and rewritten so much that they think they did A but really they did A2. It's mostly the same, but they have slightly contradicted themselves from previous works.

For instance: In OotP Dumbledore explains how Lily's protection was is the base on which Dumbledore cast the blood protection charm, which was activated by a blood relative (Petunia) taking in Harry. This protection lasts until you turn 17. But suddenly in Deathly Hallows Harry has supposedly died and given his protection onto everyone at the Battle of Hogwarts. No one has cast a blood protection charm on them, no one with their blood has taken them into their home, and no where near all of them are under 17.
