I'm not trying to make Harry seem more awesome than he is. I'm saying that according to canon Harry should have been more awesome than he was! That or he should have at least had a power. If you say Character A has a special power to defeat the big bad, then Character A better have and use that special power.

  We have very little reason to believe his reaction to his wand in PS was anything out of the ordinary, beyond Olivander's vaguely creepy melodrama over wand cores.

Now here you have a point. I think for this I was remembering the scene in the movie, more than the books. [[https://youtu.be/5whe9XtdQgw?t=2m25s]] wait for Ollivander's reaction, before the melodrama.

  Likewise, the patronus...

In Deathly Hallows, during the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry, Ron and Hermione are attacked by "A hundred dementors" "advancing, gliding toward them, sucking their way closer to Harry's despair, which was like a promise of a feast...", "Ron's silver terrier burst into the air, flicker feebly, and expire; he saw Hermione's otter twist in midair and fade". Then "a silver hare, a boar, and a fox soared past Harry, Ron, and Hermione's heads: The dementors fell back before the creatures' approach." (note that 3 patronuses (patroni??) couldn't force back the dementors) And then Harry gets in gear and sends out his own patronus, "It cantered forward, and now the dementors scattered in earnest, and immediately the night was mild again." So 3 patronuses could barely force back the dementors, but Harry's makes them "scatter in earnest".

  We never get a solid idea of what magic can/cannot do, or how any of it works beyond the most superficial level. For a series about fucking wizard school this is unacceptable, yes. We never get any idea how things work outside of Britain, and what we know about magical Britain is full of holes.

This, yes, 100%!!! VERY frustrating.
