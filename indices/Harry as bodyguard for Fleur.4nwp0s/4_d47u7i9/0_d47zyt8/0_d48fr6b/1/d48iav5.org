I think you're grasping at straws to make Harry seem more awesome than he is. We have very little reason to believe his reaction to his wand in PS was anything out of the ordinary, beyond Olivander's vaguely creepy melodrama over wand cores. It was flashy and cool, but, here's the thing... what if every witch/wizard had a similar reaction when they found a compatible wand? Crazy, I know.

Likewise, the patronus. It's a cool piece of magic that is meant to be quite hard to do. Naturally, by book five, everyone under the sun is capable of using it, but people fawn over Harry for being able to do it early. That's cool I guess, it just backs up my point about the cool factor being him able to cast it at a young age, rather than it being 'zomg the most powerful patronus ever'. It symbolises a single moment of happiness triumphing over any amount of depression/evil, and therefore Harry's ability to drive off a large number of dementors isn't actually that impressive by comparison to any other patronus. It's an impressive moment, for sure, with good dramatic timing, but it doesn't mean that Harry is secretly super powerful in canon, sorry.

He has some basic heroic virtues (stubborn will, hero complex, etc), is otherwise kind of an ass (a bit selfish and passive), and would likely be a solid professional quidditch player if he didn't have a madman after him. (Edit: He'd probably be a damned good DADA professor, too, speaking to his canonical strengths.)

I get what you're saying, in that you wish Harry had been more active and magical in canon. I would return that I wish /everything/ had been more active and magical in the Potterverse. The main plots often proceed at a crawl, due to the length of the school year, and there's tons of filler in the later books. We never get a solid idea of what magic can/cannot do, or how any of it works beyond the most superficial level. For a series about /fucking wizard school/ this is unacceptable, yes. We never get any idea how things work outside of Britain, and what we know about magical Britain is full of holes. Nothing makes any sense when you examine it closely, and JKR probably never thought any of it through for more than five seconds. So I get what you're saying about 'should have been'. But applying it to Harry only is to miss the forest for the trees, I feel.
