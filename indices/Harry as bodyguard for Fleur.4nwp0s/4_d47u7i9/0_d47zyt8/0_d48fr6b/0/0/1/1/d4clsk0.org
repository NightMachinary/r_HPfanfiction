"One of those people", LOL.

Go read the books again please. In the first book, he's been living /in a cupboard under the stairs!/ In the second, Harry had to duck to avoid being hit by a /frying pan swung by his aunt!/ His aunt, uncle, and cousin call him "freak" throughout the series.

WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU CONSIDER ABUSE?? May you never have children or be put in charge of them so long as you have these opinions!!

Face it, Dumbledore is manipulative. He might be on the good guys side, but it doesn't stop him from being manipulative. There was a thread on this previously that I can't look up while on my phone. But please, take a look.
