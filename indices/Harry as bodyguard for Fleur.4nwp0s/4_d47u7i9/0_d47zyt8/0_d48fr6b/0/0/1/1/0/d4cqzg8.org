I didn't say he was cackling and shouting "Greater Good!" But he does have a serious Glinda the Good Witch of the South issue.

If you remember, Glinda took the shoes from the dead Wicked Witch of the East and gave them to Dorothy (right in front of the Wicked Witch of the West!!), then told her to head to the Wizard. At the end of the movie, Glinda tells Dorothy she had the power to go home to whole time, thanks to the slippers.

Good, but manipulative...actually watching the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IErqIMLwtQ][clip]], Glinda is even more of a... witch, than I remembered.

Edit: You're really going to down vote my above post for pointing out the abuses Harry lived with?? Wow.
