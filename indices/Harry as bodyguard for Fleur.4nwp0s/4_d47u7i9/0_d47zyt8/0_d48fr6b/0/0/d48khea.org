From Rowling herself:

#+begin_quote
  'Harry' has always been my favourite boy's name, so if my daughter had been a son, he would have been Harry Rowling. Then I would have had to choose a different name for "Harry" in the books, because it would have been too cruel to name him after my own son. "Potter" was the surname of a family who used to live near me when I was seven years old and I always liked the name, so I borrowed it.

The series is about a boy who grew up living in a cupboard under the stairs, had frying pans aimed at his head, was called freak his entire life by his family, and was fed through a cat flap. Dumbledore's choice, was to essentially recreate the circumstances of Tom Riddle's youth in Harry Potter to see if he would come out the same and to, hopefully, thereby absolve Dumbledore of the guild he carried for not protecting Riddle from the orphanage. But I digress.

My point, was that according to the books, Harry was to have some kind of power that could defeat the dark lord. That is *canon*. "Born with a power the dark lord knows not" Naturally, I would think, my mind went to the hero, Harry Potter, having an ability, that would foil the dark lord. Even if it is just the power of being immune to killing curses, would have been something. He could be absolutely terrible at everything but gobstones and so long as he used that power to defeat Voldie, I would have been content. Instead we're given glimpses that Harry is special:

  During OotP Hermione said "You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can't."
#+end_quote

but never actually see anything.

Again, he doesn't have to be Superman. Uber!Harry is kind of boring. But if you say Character A has a special power to defeat the big bad, then Character A better have and use that special power.

I take your argument "never in any sort of logical fashion could a teenager beat a 70 year old genius prodigy like Voldemort." and I completely, 100% agree. But we're dealing with fiction and in the universe of Harry Potter, we're dealing with highly illogical wizards. Wizards who think a 14 year old can go against dragons, and a 17 year old, who they've spent the past few years alternately loving and hating, is their only hope against the dark lord. A 70 year old genius prodigy who spends 7 books and 16 years trying to kill a child isn't very logical either. "If the hero has already proven immune to the killing curse, I won't bother using it again on them. I'll just slit their throat," should be on the Evil Overlord List for magic users.

Just a note: if Harry's power was gobstones I would have been seriously pissed. I only said I'd be happy in the spirit of the point I was making.
