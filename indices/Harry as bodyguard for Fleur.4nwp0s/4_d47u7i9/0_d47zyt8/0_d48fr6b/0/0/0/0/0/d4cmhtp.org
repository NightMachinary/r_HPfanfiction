Okay I'm not going to reply after this last post but your comprehension of the words of the prophecy isn't quite there. The 'born' part refers ONLY to the thrice defying parents and end of July. It does not say BORN marked as Voldemorts equal and born with the power - the power (and the marking) comes after.

Mum's love: it's not just that Lily loves her son. It's her sacrifice (because she loves him) that protects him. It prevented Voldemort from harming Harry, until he stole Harry's blood. However, the 'should have stopped working' point is moot, because as per canon it /didn't/ stop working entirely. The protection remained while Harry was near Petunia and home; that is, near Lily's blood. Also, IIRC, Voldemort technically didn't try killing Harry again until he'd left Privet Drive for good (he tried to get Dumbledore to kill possessed Harry in OotP), which suggests that Voldemort did realise that the blood protection could linger beyond when he stole Harry's blood.

Secondly, Harry's love is /also/ very clearly stated in HBP. 'so it just means...love?' Harry asks Dumbledore and Dumbledore explains that yes, the sacrifice borne of Lily's love provided him protection as a child, and Harry's love for his parents and Sirius (and his friends) is what compels his hero complex and desire to defeat Voldemort. It's a very poignant chapter actually, as Harry realises that he has a choice (as Voldemort did) between following the prophecy, or turning his back and refusing to fight, and Harry decides he wants to fight because it's the right thing and to save the people he loves.

Further on Harry's love: Harry does the same chosen sacrifice as his mum did, to save the people he loved (Ginny, Ron, Hermione, others) and to avenge the deaths of his loved ones. Voldemort being unable to silence or attack the crowd had zero to do with the wand and everything to do with Harry's sacrifice (it is explicitly stated in Harry's monologue at the end). The only wand relevant thing is that the wand won't work against its /real/ master - Harry. Voldemort was still able to attack and/or kill others (Snape, for example). He even says 'i have done my usual magic with this wand;' that is, the wand hasn't hindered him until he tries to attack Harry. Harry's sacrifice protected the crowd.

The second killing curse (the one in the forest) did work, because Harry died and went to purgatory. It worked because Harry was WILLING to die, so the wand wasn't acting against its owner. Harry was only able to come back to life because of his mother's sacrifice (again, the love protection) being 'alive' in voldemorts blood (ie, since he had Harry's blood). Harry had the choice to 'go on' which means that his soul /had/ been hit by the Killing curse that time. So again, the wand is irrelevant until Voldemort tries to hit harry with the final Killing curse (against its owner and against the owners wishes), when it backfires. The crowd's protected only by Harry's sacrifice.

So to reiterate: Harry lives (and comes back to life) because of his mother's loving sacrifice. Everyone else (who survived until Harry walked into the forest) lives/cannot be killed by Voldemort because of Harry's loving sacrifice. Supported with clear evidence from the books, most of it /very/ explicitly stated (if I had access to the books rn I'd even quote the entire relevant paragraphs). That is the power that led to Harry's survival and thus, to Voldemorts ultimate demise.

All my points are explicitly stated in the book, enough so that they're clear for the children reading. They require zero guesswork, and are essentially 'Harry Potter canon fact.'

You're majority speculating your opinion, whereas I'm literally just saying what's stated in the books. The books literally say the power is love. It's not 'Dumbledore guessing', because it's a literary work and the author intended it to be love, as was very clearly indicated . I'm analysing it solely as literature; you're trying to analyse it as something that exists beyond what the author meant. There is no extra power that we don't see, because if that power existed, it would have been written (at least implicitly) into the text.

Now, it's fine for fanon and fanfiction to want to promote and create this 'power beyond love's but speaking from a canonical standpoint, the power is love and it was a power Harry learnt and was blessed with, albeit not born with.

Thanks for reading. Once again, I won't be replying further because we've gone WAAAY off the initial topic, and I'm not sure if you're arguing based primarily on fanon or not.
