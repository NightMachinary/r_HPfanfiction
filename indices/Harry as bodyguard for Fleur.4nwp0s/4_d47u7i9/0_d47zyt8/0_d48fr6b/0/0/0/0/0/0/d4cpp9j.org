  Thanks for reading. Once again, I won't be replying further because we've gone WAAAY off the initial topic, and I'm not sure if you're arguing based primarily on fanon or not.

I've only ever given examples from canon. Therefore, I'm arguing from canon.

  However, the 'should have stopped working' point is moot, because as per canon it didn't stop working entirely.

This was my point. Because it didn't stop working, it could not have been Lily's protection that was protecting him there. You can't say that "because what you're saying happened in canon it is not canon." That Lily's protection was gone from Harry after the Graveyard, but not gone from Harry because the house was still protected.

Please reread the prophecy that I quoted above. It specifically states that "the one (Harry or Neville) with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies." "WILL BE born...," they haven't been born yet. They have the power in the womb and then are born. Voldemort merely identified which child it would be (Harry or Neville). He didn't give Harry the power. Especially not, if, as you're saying, Harry's power is love.

You're right, this is way off topic now. But people tell me I'm wrong using only their opinions and not backing up anything they say with any examples and darn it: [[http://xkcd.com/386/][Duty Calls]]. You at least have used examples. I'll leave you with this:

While Harry's mom dying for him was the catalyst, it was the charm that Dumbledore cast and Petunia taking him in that activated the power. Dumbledore explains this in OotP. Also part of the protection that Harry is talking about requires someone of their blood taking them in and it disappears when they turn 17. Everyone at the Battle of Hogwarts is not under 17, not with all the villagers from Hogsmead being there. Harry was wrong about what was protecting everyone in Deathly Hallows.

Excellent discussion! Would 100% debate with you again.
