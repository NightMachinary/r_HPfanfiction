    and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not.

  You misquoted the prophecy. Harry wasn't /born/ with the power the dark lord knows not, he simply has it. The power was love (Lily's and Harry's own) BTW, it was explicitly stated in like two of the books.

First the prophecy:

#+begin_quote
  The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies.

"the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies." Actually, yes he was born with it. He has the power before he's born, therefore he was born with the power.

Dumbledore thinks it's the power of love. And this is repeated. But we don't actually see any evidence of this.

Harry's mom's love: he can't be touched by Voldie. We don't know why, but it is presumed to be his mother's protection. Born out slightly by Voldie touching Harry after the resurrection. But then why are the blood wards still working? The blood wards are linked to the blood of Harry's mother and aunt, therefore they should have stopped working, at least against Voldie, after the graveyard.

Harry's love: I can't say we ever saw any evidence of this. The second killing curse doesn't kill Harry? Harry was the wand's master, and the wand won't attack it's master. Plus there was that second soul it could destroy instead. Voldie can't silence the crowd? Again, Voldie wasn't the wand's master. Harry points this out.
