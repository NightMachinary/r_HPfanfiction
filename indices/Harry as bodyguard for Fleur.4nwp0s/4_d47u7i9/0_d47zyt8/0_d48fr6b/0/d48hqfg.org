I think you've really missed the point. JK named the protagonist Harry Potter for a reason, which is that it's the most common, basic, average name she could find. This fact is a great representation of the character. This series isn't about a great hero who uses his strength and intelligence to defeat evil. Its about an average kid who stands up for what is right and triumphs.

'It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.'

Harry is the best in class at Defense Against the Dark Arts, he's good on a broom, but in everything else he's around average. His strengths help him in the story, but never in any sort of logical fashion could a teenager beat a 70 year old genius prodigy like Voldemort.

I like a good powerful!Harry fic. But they are by nature anti-canon. Which isn't a problem until people start confusing one for the other.
