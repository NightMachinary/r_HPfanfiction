I like Fleur stories. And seeing a badass Fleur would new and pretty cool.

But your sexism/bigotry is showing when you say Harry is the bodyguard simply because he has a penis. Or to fulfill older woman fantasies, although I don't doubt this last is a major component.

Harry is usually the bodyguard because he was the main character in the books. And because he should have been the most awesome wizard since Ahmenotep, instead of the namby-pamby teenager who literally let Hermione do everything!

Harry was born with the "power the dark Lord knows not". I don't care if she has internal or external "plumbing", Fleur couldn't get past the grindylows in the second task!!

You can argue that Barty/Moody was helping him during the tasks, and I don't recall exactly how much he did help (play to your strengths, gillyweed, sabotaging the third task, but not details), but Harry did out fly a Dragon during the tasks and sent over 100 Dementors packing in third year. Both without outside help. Which is far more than we saw Fleur do.
