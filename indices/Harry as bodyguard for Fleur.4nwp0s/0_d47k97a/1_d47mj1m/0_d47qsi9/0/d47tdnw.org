Oh no, badass older Fleur who already made a name for herself as a mercenary could meet badass Hermione while on the job. You could name it The beauty and the bookworm or something similarly cheesy if that's already taken.

I imagine Fleur as the veela version of Draco Malfoy, only slightly more tolerant.

So Fleur seems to be all brawns act first, ask questions later which drives Hermione crazy. Sparks fly. Ron is in the background like "But! But!..." and Harry is worried his bff and his bodyguard will accidentally end up killing eachother and him before Voldemort gets to him.

I don't know how they end up together, but I can see some of that hate sex happening. Fleur is an equal opportunity sex fiend and Hermione never got to figure out her sexuality, but hey're both like this was a mistake and I regret it and it will never happen again.

The fight against Voldemort degenerates into civil war. It gets pretty grimdark at this point. They are forced to fight side by side, to rely on eachother while Harry is kept safe at home. More hate sex happens, just to relieve tension, you understand, only this time there's less hate and more kisses stolen in the night while waiting for an ambush. Meanwhile Harry is moping at home and Ron still doesn't understand what's going on. He's dealing with the logistics of OotP tho, and the strategics side of things, because he proved to be better at that than Hermione, to her chagrin. Maybe she just can't really see the big picture as he can, or can't think as clearly under pressure when people's lives are at stake. So that's why she's on the field while Ron is in the background.

So she's also dealing with a bit of an identity crisis, since the molds she thought she fit in are all shattered. She's not used to being average, and here she is, with Ron of all people upstaging her at the thing she thought she was best at and then Fleur is proving again and again to be better than her at practical stuff, and although that is only because Fleur has years of experience in the field and with guerrilla wars, Hermione's still not happy. She discovers her kinky side at this point. Harry suspects what's going on because he's perceptive like that, but he's all cool with it, which makes Hermione happy. That's why they're bffs.

Anyway.
