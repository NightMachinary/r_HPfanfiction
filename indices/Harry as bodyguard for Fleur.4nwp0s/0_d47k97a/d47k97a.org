See, I saw this, and a thought popped into my head. Why would Harry be a bodyguard for Fleur? What on earth does she have to fear? She's older, generally seen as more competent by the public (if not actually shown to be in the books), and she's not an international celebrity... so wouldn't it make much more sense for Fleur to end up as /Harry's/ bodyguard, since he has at least one threat to his life every year? Harry is one character who, canonically, could really do with having a bodyguard, dammit.

Then I remembered that gender roles were a thing. Shame. I would totally read about badass bodyguard Fleur.
