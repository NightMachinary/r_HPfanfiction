Yeah... I'm thinking the main reason this exists is to fulfil the 'hot older girl' fantasy (why 90% of Fleur/Harry exists), and ofc women need to be protected, and men are protectors, so screw making sense. It kinda bugs me. A penis does not make you an effective bodyguard, especially when you're a scrawny little 14 year old shit with little in the way of believable combat experience. Generally speaking, young!uber!Harry is the most irritating and immersion-breaking kind of uber!Harry.

That's not to say I dislike Fleur/Harry, because it actually fits quite well personality wise, but contrived bodyguard romance would work much better if Fleur was the guard.
