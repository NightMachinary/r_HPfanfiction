It's very well written, but I can't guarantee you'll like it. The protagonist is rather divisive: Depending on who you ask, she's either one of the best characters in fanfiction, or one of the most unlikeable.

For those who do get into it, though, it's probably the most rewarding fanfiction series out there. It's basically like a standalone novel series, with tonnes of room for speculation, discussion, and analysis.

For that reason, it has a small but very dedicated fandom. Over at [[/r/alexandraquick]] we discuss new chapters as they are released. There's also a [[https://quickipedia.fandom.com/wiki/Quickipedia][wiki]] (watch out for spoilers), and a [[http://www.samgabrielvo.com/alexandraquick/][semi-professional audiobook]] in progress.
