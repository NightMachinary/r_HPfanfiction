I'd say give it a try. It's pretty well-written... by fanfic standards it's INCREDIBLY well written. This was the same guy who wrote Hogwarts Houses Divided, which in my opinion is one of the best HP fics ever, certainly the best "next-gen" fic.

Keep in mind, Alexandra Quick herself is not always the most likeable of protagonists... but the author knows she isn't. When she acts like a brat, the narrative treats her as if she acts like a brat. A brave and clever brat but also a TOTAL FUCKING LUNATIC who would have ended up dead ten times over if it hadn't been for some incredible lucky breaks.

I'll take her over any of the indy!Harrys in fanfic, though. The author at least doesn't demand that I worship her.
