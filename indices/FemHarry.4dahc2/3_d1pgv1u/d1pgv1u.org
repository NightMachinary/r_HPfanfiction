A female Harry would not have the same core friends and therefore not experience the same canon events.

Dudley, Vernon, Petunia, Ron, Hermione, Snape, Ginny, and Draco would all treat her very differently compared to the books. How she was treated by them would also heavily depend how she looked.

Most stories assume she looks like Lily, but it would be interesting to explore other looks for her. She looking like James would definitely elicit the same reactions from Snape as in the books. She could look like her relatives from the Black line, for example Bellatrix, Andromeda, or even Narcissa. That would open up completely new possibilities.
