I think she'd be good looking, James and Lily were both attractive (I think or maybe that's fanon) and their kid would get good genes. Maybe not the hottest girl at Hogwarts, but with her being a good seeker and famous she'd have a lot of male attention. Ron would totally have a crush on her, shes his female best friend who plays Quidditch and who he has a lot of fun with. I think Cedric would still go with Cho. Fem Harry would have probably been crushing on Cedric and be disappointed he asked Cho. If fem Harry still looked like James, Snape would treat her the same as Harry. If she looked more like Lily there might be some creepy perving on the Lily lookalike. I envision that relationship to be like Sansa and Littlefinger on Game of thrones. He'd help her but it would be creepy and there would be ulterior motives.
