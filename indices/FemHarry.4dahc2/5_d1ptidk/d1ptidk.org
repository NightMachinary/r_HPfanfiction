  What if Harry was a girl?
#+end_quote

Then Harry would be a girl. The rest depends on the author.

#+begin_quote
  Would she be hot?
#+end_quote

I don't think so; 35,6 degree Celcius is certainly warm but I don't count it as hot.

#+begin_quote
  Would Ron have a crush on her?
#+end_quote

Ron has a crush on his sandwich, so nope, because Harry isn't a sandwich.

#+begin_quote
  Would Cedric ask her for the Yule Ball instead of Cho?
#+end_quote

Nope, being a hufflepuff Cedric is very loyal to Cho so he wouldn't just randomly ask another girl to the Yule ball.

#+begin_quote
  What about Snape?
#+end_quote

Snape would not become a girl just because Harry had.

And that's it. I apologise if it's not nonsensical enough. Honestly though, if you change the character's gender to pair them with people, you kind of fail in my opinion; do it as a “what if” exercise and follow how it naturally progresses or if your plot actually requires it, but not for pairings, please; I mean, if you have a pairing, have it be a part of the story and come naturally, not be forced and the only focus of a “story” that doesn't even make sense.
