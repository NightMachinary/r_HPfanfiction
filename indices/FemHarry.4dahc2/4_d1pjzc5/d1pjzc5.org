I was writing one, and anyone is welcome to pick it up and run with it, but she was physically the flip of Harry, she looked like Lily with Hazel eyes instead, with no glasses. As a result, Petunia treated her slightly better, but refused to have any close interactions, so she had thrift clothing in roughly the right sizes instead of Dudley's cast offs, although generally out of fashion/Weasley-ish. She also wore boots larger than she needed because Petunia could only show her so much decency without bringing it to Vernon and Dudley's attention, so the same large boots were to be for several years of growth. My plans for the fic were that she was going to be far more proactive than canon Harry, directly coming into conflict with Dudley because she realized early that he couldn't tell on her because if he did, he'd be beaten up by a girl. While Vernon obviously still would have done something drastic to her, he would also be disappointed in Dudley.

I think she'd also be far more reminiscent of James in attitude, although with a very justice based angle. The Twins would be good partners in crime, until they disagreed on a target as the twins prank indiscriminately, while Heather (my Potter) would prefer to target people she thought were doing wrong by others.

Magically she would be very powerful for her age, but with absolutely terrible control, as with a lot of normal fics. She would be magically a feeler, she could perform magic far easier in uncontrolled blasts based on her thoughts or whims, and struggle a lot with procedural magics.

I don't think Heather would be hot, but then again, I only really imagined her first few years at Hogwarts. Ron I think would not have much of a crush on her, because I think this particular fem!Harry would distrust boys a lot, and so hold Ron at arms length for a lot of the getting-to-know-each-other period. My iteration of fem!Harry was also going to be split between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, as she doesn't have a subtle or crafty bone in her body. She's ambitious, but all her ambitions have to do with saving people or keeping people safe, righting-wrongs etc. In her more confident moments, she might consider being a super hero as a possible profession.

Cedric would not ask her to the yule ball, she might consider going with friends, and if pressed by being selected in the tournament, she might ask Hermione early as friends.

Snape would be curiously passive to her, unless goaded (which Heather takes care of herself, standing up for Neville and the others), where his temper would be like a flash fire, exploding suddenly, and then sulking. Mostly he would try to ignore her, because she looks too much like Lily until he looks into James eyes, taunting him from death.

I can post the fic if anyone is interested, but I have no real intention of continuing it, and I think I was only two or three chapters in. I'm not dedicated enough to write on a schedule, and I feel too guilty not having any schedule at all, so I tend to not write at all.
