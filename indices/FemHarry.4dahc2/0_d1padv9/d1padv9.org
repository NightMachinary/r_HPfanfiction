  What if Harry was a girl?
#+end_quote

As a first, one could think about how the Dursleys would raise her. There are a couple of ideas there, but in the end I think their hate against magic would win out and Iris would be just as neglected and mistreated as her male counterpart.

  Would she be hot?
#+end_quote

We know that Harry isn't bad looking. If Jasmine had the same luck in the genetic roulette, then she'd be at least pretty if not downright gorgeous as her mother was said to be.

  Would Ron have a crush on her.
#+end_quote

If Ivy has similar interests as Harry, then Ron would certainly see her as a very approachable girl. But I always liked when Heather had other interest than Harry. We are still in the 80's after all and Magnolia was raised in an arguably conservative and regressive household. Ergo she would probably be discouraged by society as a whole from doing some of the things Harry did. The author may decide.

  Would Cedric ask her to the Yule Ball instead of Cho?
#+end_quote

I don't see why he should. Cedric never so much as talked to Harry. And before the tournament, Aster was probably a non-entity in his life as well, being even younger than Cho. If you remind yourself, 3 years difference were half an eternity back in teenage years. Maybe Rose spoke with him at the Worldcup a bit more? It all depends on the story, really.

  What about Snape?
#+end_quote

If Clover is looking like her mother, I could see this becoming awkward really quickly. Maybe she is taken under his wing, maybe he tries to simply ignore her, maybe shes even more of a target.

However, I could also see her looking a lot like her grandmothers, or having some resemblance to the males in the family. Its a matter of establishing the details in the story. If we ignore the recently published "real" family tree of the Potters and go with whats actually interesting, then maybe Senna could look a lot like a Black through her grandmother Dorea Potter. Wouldn't that make for a nice 9 ^{3/4} scene; Narcissa seeing the mirror image of young Bellatrix in Calla?

Also, as you might have figured by now: *Flower names*. My vote in that matter: Poppy Potter
