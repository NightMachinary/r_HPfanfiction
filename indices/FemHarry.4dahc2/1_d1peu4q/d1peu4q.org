I always imagine a Fem!Harry to be a massive tomboy since she grew up in a mostly male household and I highly doubt Petunia would teach her how to be a girl beyond "This is how a lady should act in public!" which would probably drive Fem!Harry further away from feminine pursuits.

She would walk and talk like a boy, dress like a boy when in casual, jeans and trainers and Dudley's baggy shirts, never wear makeup unless forced and be extremely hot headed, Lily was described as being quite vocal and forceful (not sure if it's canon or not but it's my headcanon at least) and Fem!Harry would most likely receive that trait from her

Since Sirius, Hagrid and Dumbledore are canon Harry's role models, then Fem!Harry would be even more driven towards the tomboy ways, only Hermione could possible drive some femininity into her, though Ron would probably exacerbate her tomboyish nature.

Living in the girls dorm wouldn't really help since she would look down on Parvati and Lavender for being /too/ girly and only caring about makeup and gossip and Hermione is too much of a nerd.

With Snape it really depends on how she looks, if she was like canon Harry with the Potter black hair and her mothers eyes nothing much would change, however if she had her mother's hair then perhaps Snape might go a little easier on her, I really doubt he'd crush on her though, to him she would still be half-Potter.

For romance since Ginny wouldn't be an option (unless she was gay but still unlikely) then either Neville, Dean or one of the Weasley twins would be a likely choice.
