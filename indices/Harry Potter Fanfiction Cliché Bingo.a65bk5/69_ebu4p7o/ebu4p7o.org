Hmm. The "Daphne Greengrass" entry - does that just mean "Daphne is developed as a character" or is it more specific? It doesn't say anything specific, but just fleshing out a minor character shouldn't count as a cliche IMO.

If it's specifically about Haphne or similar, then I think Methods of Rationality avoids pretty much everything. Even the Dumbledore bashing freebie.
