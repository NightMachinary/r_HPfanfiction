  please add 'completely ridiculous confrontations in the great hall, where everybody is silent except harry and dumbdor', especially if it includes a very long and incoherent ranting monologue by harry where NONE of the 800 other students make a noise.

Monologueing Harry is so very special! Especially if it goes against Dumbledore and the grand manipulator (according to the fics), who played everyone like puppets for decades is completely dumbfounded by the accusations of Harry the twerp. Sometimes they literally make Dumbledore stutter over his words, because he's so stumped!
