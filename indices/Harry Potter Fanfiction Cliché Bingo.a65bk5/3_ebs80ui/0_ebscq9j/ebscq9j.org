will harry's quidditch toned muscles be enough to resist dan granger's fury at courting Mione? will our heroes realize ronald weasley's table manners means he will become a backstabbing death eater? how many paragraphs will harry's inheritance ritual test at gringotts be - will he slice his palm, or prick his finger on a needle? will lord potter-black-peverell [....] be able to stop dumbdore's twinkling over his destiny (think the guy on the cover of Hobbes' Leviathan, except in garish, flamboyant robes and merry midnight twinkling eyes)

--------------

how quickly will emma granger be able to deduce:

that harry is abused

the exact context behind each of his scars, including the date, the method, the perpetrator and the position of the moon.

an accurate 12-year long overview of every missed meal

the consistency, texture and nutritional value of each morsel of food harry /did/ manage to somehow eat

harry's complete genomic sequence including the epigenetic repercussions of his abuse

--------------

entirely through one look at his cast-off clothes and odd-fitting glasses? (bonus points if its portrayed in BBC sherlock fashion)

will they mention 'british professionals are trained in recognizing abuse' in the car ride home, or at the dinner table? will they reveal that they're also the personal dentist to The Queen, but she prefers them to call her 'lizzie'? will dan threaten his daughter's first friend with the guns or the dentistry drills?
