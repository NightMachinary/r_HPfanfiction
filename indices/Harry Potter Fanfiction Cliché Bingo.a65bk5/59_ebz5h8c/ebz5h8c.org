Lily and James being horrible parents and Snape being some saint. It usually involves some lengthy description of them being described as attractive and wealthy and having good jobs, so that somehow means they must be evil incarnate, especially because Lily chose the smart, attractive guy who grew up instead of the guy who never grew up and joined the magic nazis.. I swear it comes off like an incel wrote it 99% of the time.

Harems

Ron being evil or cartoonishly stupid

Some fancy ass name like Hadrian or Hadrianus or Heironymous. The only time I ever saw it work was a one shot where Harry's real name was never revealed, but the fact that his legal name wasn't Harry enabled him to get out of the Triwizard. Harry does seem simple, even compared to the Weasley's names, but it is his name. And if folks feel the need to create a new one, at least make it something reasonable---Harrison, Harold, Henry, Heinrich---not Hieronymous or Hadrian.

Killing green eyes.

Overpowered adult like 12 year olds.

Slytherin house and Snape easily embracing Harry once he is sorted there. Some of the older kids likely had parents who were put away in prison after Voldemort's first fall, but they just end up loving Harry.

Cartoonishly evil Dudley. He's a nasty little bully, but he's not abusive like Petunia and Vernon and he's a child. People create stories where he outright tortures Harry.

Lordships. There's no sign that heredity nobility exists in the Wizarding world beyond Sirius once sarcastically going "the ancient and noble house of Black." Sometimes people create lordships, which isn't that bad, but then folks go overboard where Harry is Duke Gryffindor Hufflepuff Slytherin Ravenclaw.
