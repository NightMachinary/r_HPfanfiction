This would make it an interesting thing and if you can internal justify it okay. But many times he picks them up in a second hand luggage or the tip top poshes store available and everyone is astounded by it.

If they are more common him having one should be so amazing. If they are ridiculously expensive having one becomes a status symbol. Why live in a Hogwarts bedroom when you can take a whole apartment with all your stuff to Hogwarts?

If there is stigma against them people should be way more wary of interacting with it or look down on him for it.
