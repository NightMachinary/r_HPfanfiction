Who says they don't? Maybe they're a relatively new invention? Maybe they have a bad reputation? Maybe they're seen as base. Or maybe they're extremely expensive? Or maybe brick and mortar is seen as a status symbol but while anyone can pitch a comfy tent or suitcase, that's what magical hobos do? So it's socially frowned on. I don't know.

I admit, writers could do a better job of explaining why this is uncommon. Maybe if I manage to write my own fix one of these days, my hero's backpack house will be some kind of revolutionary thing.
