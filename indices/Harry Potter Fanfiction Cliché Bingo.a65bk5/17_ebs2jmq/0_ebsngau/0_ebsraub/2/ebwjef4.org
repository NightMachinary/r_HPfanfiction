  Even famously-paranoid Mad Eye Moody has an actual home he lives in, instead of living out of a literal palace in a box
#+end_quote

honestly it would be /so good/ if moody in canon just carried around a small spartan cube in which he lived in, just placing wards outside it whenever he goes to sleep and changing his sleeping location up and down england every night (near a pond somewhere, in a welsh forest clearing, in some wheat field in scotland, an inn in bristol, on top of big ben, etc), because you can never be sure when operational security is compromised.

barty could've just intercepted him through the floo when he's going away from some ministry event or something, instead of breaking into his home.

i imagine the floo-interception occurs from a corresponding floo-lane with barty holding a magical shepherd's crook.
