Harry stepped outside of Gringott's in a daze. He was tingling with the amount of power now flowing through his body, both from the tonic repairing his body and the song of magic now unrestrained flowing through him.

Despite being wrapped in the Cloak of Invisibility, a crowd of witches turned towards him, though all stepping back and kneeling once they faced his general direction. The men bowed instead. He felt a tug on his cloak from just behind him. His pulsing senses identified Luna Lovegood even before he turned to see her there.

"Hello, Harry."

"Luna. How did you know it was me? Can you see through the Cloak?"

"No. I saw the back of your shoe in a gap. No one else has trainers wrapped in duct tape."

"I suppose I should get those replaced."

"Why? Do you not want me to recognise you?"

"It's not that. They're not very stylish."

"Are they comfortable?"

"Sure."

Luna shrugged.

Harry focused his eyes on hers, and found himself inside her mind. It was a bit confusing, but the overall sentiment was passive and vaguely interested in everything around her. He caught a stray urge for some ice cream. "Would you like to go get some ice cream?" he said aloud.

In her mind he heard, 'No, it'll spoil my dinner,' and a moment later she said exactly that.

Deciding that the reverb wasn't worth the headache, Harry retracted from her mind. "Is there something you would like to do?"

"There's always something. What would you like to do?"

"I'm not sure. It seems like I can do just about anything I want. There are a bunch of things which I suppose I should do."

"Do you have to do them now?"

"I don't think so."

"Okay, well, when I'm feeling confused and can't decide what to do, you know what I like to do?"

"What's that?"

Moments later, Harry and Luna were sitting in a pile of kittens in a muggle pet shop. Luna was purring the loudest, but Harry was thinking that with a little practice he might be able to catch up.
