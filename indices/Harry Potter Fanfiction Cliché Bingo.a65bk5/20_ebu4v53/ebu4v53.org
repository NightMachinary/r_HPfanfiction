"Greetings, Harry Potter. I am called Ragnuk." the goblin at his desk greeted the wizard who had just entered his office and sat down.\\
"Hello, Ragnuk." Harry said politely.\\
Ragnuk gasped before he beamed, "Harry Potter, no wizard has ever bothered to remember a goblin's name until now. You have earned the sworn allegiance of the entire Goblin Nation today."\\
Harry blinked, "Um, thank you, Mr. Ragnuk. Um, I was asked to come here to perform an inheritance test?"\\
"Yes, /Lord/ Harry Potter," Ragnuk agreed, "In fact, it's already been done. A function of the chair you sat down in just now."\\
Harry looked down at the comfy chair he was in for a few seconds. "Neato." he said wisely.

Ragnuk just nodded, "As it turns out, you are the direct legal descendant and inheritor of the estates of Potter, Black, Peverell, Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ambrosius, William the Conquerer, and a few dozen others that don't need naming just now. You are the richest and most titled person in the world as of-"

The door suddenly burst open to reveal Albus Dumbledore! "I confess!" the aged headmaster with twinkling eyes proclaimed, "I sealed Lily & James' wills to keep Harry ignorant of his titles and money so I could steal them all for myself, despite already being Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump and therefore already rich and famous! My boy!"\\
A security troll standing by the door promptly bashed Dumbledore over the head with his club, before dragging the headmaster away to the Gringotts dungeons.\\
Harry raised an eyebrow, unperturbed by the whole scene, "So, I have more than one vault full of galleons now, Sir Ragnuk?"\\
Ragnuk beamed again at hearing his name, before he pushed over a balance sheet towards the young heir with emerald orbs for eyes, "Yes, in fact, you have over a hundred, and quite probably more money than exists in magical Britain."

And that was when Ginny Weasley barged into the room, "I confess! I've been dosing Harry with love potions to make him marry me so mum and I can get control of all his money!"\\
The security troll (which had just come back) promptly bashed her over the head with his club before dragging her away to the dungeons to join Dumbledore.\\
Without missing a beat, Ragnuk continued, "Also, the main Potter Vault has a grimoire that you can use to learn the secret family spells, the Other Secret Slytherin Vault has a grimoire to teach you parselmagic, the Black Vault has a useful primer on How to Learn Foolproof Occlumency in a Day, and the Special Black Vault has a few dozen-"\\
Ron Weasley burst in! "I confess! I've been hanging around Harry to try and leech his fame and money! And shag 'Mione!"\\
Since the security troll wasn't back yet, the red-head helpfully bashed himself over the head with a spare club before (somehow, despite the concussion) Apparating himself to the dungeons.\\
"...Few dozen magically-binding betrothal contracts, which as they are written, essentially gives you a harem of attractive slave girls, including the lovely Daphne Greengrass, photoshopped picture included-"\\
Cornelius Fudge burst into the room next, "I confess! I see Harry Potter as a threat, so I've been trying to discredit and assassinate him!"\\
The security troll (which had finally returned) raised its club, but before he could bash Fudge, Amelia Bones forced her way into the room and slapped a pair of magical cuffs on the Minister for Magic. "/I/ confess to fully supporting Harry Potter despite his de-facto autocratic power over Britain and the magical world's economy!" she declared, before dragging Fudge away to face trial before the Wizengamot, followed by the somewhat puzzled security troll.

There was a pause. "And?" Harry prompted.\\
Ragnuk shook his head, "That's just about everything, Lord Potter."\\
Then the goblin passed over a bottomless sack of galleons from under his desk and smiled at the young wizard who had inherited everything, "I suggest to you that you go out into Diagon Alley...no-no, make that Knockturn Alley, and get yourself a cool and dark-looking new outfit, a custom-made wand that's unbreakable and makes your spells a hundred times more powerful than before, and a trunk like Mad Eye Moody's, except with enough space to store a few mansions."\\
Harry stared at the big sack of galleons that was offered to him.\\
"I also suggest picking up a couple of self-help books on how to be edgy." Ragnuk suggested, "And when you're done, hurry back, in 3 hours or so I'd like to unseal and read James, Lily and Sirius's wills, no doubt giving you even /more/ wealth than you've just acquired today and telling you where all the secret stuff to become a super-animagus and wandless prodigy and stuff is."
