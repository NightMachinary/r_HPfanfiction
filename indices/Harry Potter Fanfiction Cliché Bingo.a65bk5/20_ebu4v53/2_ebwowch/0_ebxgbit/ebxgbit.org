Mm, no, I'm just parodying those parodies where Harry is loved by Griphook/etc for remembering their names, which in turn are parodies of those fics where Harry gets the help of the goblins just by being polite to them when most wizards just sneer at them. Nothing in particular comes to mind at the moment but I'm sure you know some.

But, hmm...~compares house-elf ears to goblin ears~\\
That has potential for a silly fic where the goblins at Gringotts are house-elves in disguise, serving wizards while the goblins have more important things to do.
