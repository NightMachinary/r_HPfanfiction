The issue is that so much time is spent on a shopping spree that literally has no effect. A full wardrobe of acromantula silk robes/shirt/trousers/underwear that never even gets a mention afterwords. I'd much rather if lots of adults just transfigure/charm their own clothes for whatever they feel like wearing.

As for the candies, I'd totally buy the idea that it's for his own use. Gotta deal with all his work and not curse the shit out of people for being so annoying.
