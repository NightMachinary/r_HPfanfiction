I get the problem with the shopping for clothes, but the alternative is dropping a mention in every few chapters. "Oh, by the way, nice pants, Harry." Gets old after a while.

My current WiP, I had them learn about ordering nice clothes via owl, and then just let the reader assume that they started wearing normal clothes - you know, like people do. The "Oh, this is a thing" moment was necessary, but following on from it wasn't.
