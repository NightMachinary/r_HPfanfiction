Custom clothes should be 'Armor'. There's plenty of cause for a prudent wizard with a life-threatening occupation/hobby/destiny to weave some charms into their clothes -- that's the basis of the Shield Hats made by the twins.

I also protest the inclusion of Knockturne shopping. It's a shopping district. What else would you expect there?

Other ideas:

- 'Only the right person can see/access/open/lift/wear this game-breaking item of power'

- dead muggle loved one

- magical maturity metamorphosis

- potions addiction (usually dreamless sleep or calming draught)

- Dumbledore's doped candies
