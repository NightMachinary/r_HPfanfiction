- "The Dark/the Light"

- "the golden trio"
- "firsties" used excessively
- nicknames being used very inappropriately, like people who aren't trying to annoy Ron calling him "Ronniekins" or people who actually respect Dudley calling him "Dudders"
- calling Gryffindors/Ravenclaws/Hufflepuffs/Slytherins lions/eagles/badgers/snakes, or stupid nicknames like "puffs" and "snakelings"
- Slytherin children having no emotions, friends, or childlike traits; they are politicking 100% of the time
- random British spellings and out of place British slang just for some authentic "colour"
- Fred and George say every- other- word- in- a- sentence- hilarious!
- Hagrid's dialect incomprehensibly written
- Luna knows everything, but also nargles XD
