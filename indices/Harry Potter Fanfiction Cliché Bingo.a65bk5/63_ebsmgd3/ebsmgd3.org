Shitty descriptions deserve their own spot (or row). You have:

- Questions where the answer is obvious (eg Will Love conquer all?)

- A spam of relationships, half of which appear just once or twice (H/G, R/Hr, Ar/M, F/An, G/Al, NL/LL, DM/LV)

- A lot of tropes ("mocking" names for Dumbledore/Voldemort, bashing, harems, overused phrases)
