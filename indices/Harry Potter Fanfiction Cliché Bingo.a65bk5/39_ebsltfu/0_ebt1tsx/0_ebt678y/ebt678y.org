The problem is that in canon pretty much every time Harry is alone with Hermoine he gets depressed and starts missing Ron and his jokes because Hermoine is too serious for him, and both of them absolutely suck at giving each other emotional support.

In fanfics, Harmony only works if Harry and/or Hemione have different personalities but I can't really see their canon versions having a stable long-term relationship that doesn't fall apart after a few weeks.
