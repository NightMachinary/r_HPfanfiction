Yeah. Harry isn't good at provide emotional support. He has no idea what it looks like. This is the same kid whose closest thing to a father just died, and then almost immediately afterward was forced to live with people he hates who hates him, then had absolutely no contact from his friends.

He literally ignored and let Hermione cry for weeks when Ron left them because he had no idea what to do and he was severely uncomfortable. He's always dealt with his feelings by himself (out of neccesity) and just assumed Hermione was the same way.
