I hate Weasley bashing so much. Sure, Ron and his family aren't perfect- but that just makes them human.

Ron is Harry's best friend for a /reason/. Ron was willing to be his friend the moment he met Harry on the train, and he offered Harry his sandwich- even though Ron's from a poor family without much money, his first act is to offer somebody else his food. Ron is Harry and Hermoine's guide through the wizarding world, providing context and background that they don't have. He also keeps them grounded. Without Ron, Harry would sullenly angst all the time while Hermoine would go completely off the rails on a researching bender. Ron's that laid back, down to earth friend who pulls them out when they get too deep. When Harry blows up and Hermoine storms off in anger, Ron is the one to play diplomat between them.

People who cite Ron's mistreatment of Harry in his 4th year and during the Horcrux Hunt forget that in 4th year, Ron was 14, and Harry had expressed a desire to enter the Triwizard Tournament /immediately/ before his name was called. Fourteen year olds aren't known for their wisdom, and Ron making mistakes is understandable. As for the Horcrux Hunt, Ron already had low self esteem, and then he was wearing a mind altering dark artifact that played on his insecurities. He didn't abandon them. He stormed out in a moment of anger to clear his head for a few minutes and forgot about Hermoine's wards. It's not the same thing.

As for the whole "Ginny uses love potion' nonsense, that's just contrived bullshit. Harry sees Hermoine as the sister he never had, and Ginny is a hot fun Quidditch girl who shares his interests and knows how to support him emotionally. Of course he falls in love with her.

People just bash the Weasleys because they get in the way of the HHr shippers or whatever other dumb reason they come up with. Removing Ron from the equation unbalances the whole dynamic between Harry and Hermoine, and I can't imagine it would survive without him.
