I grew up in a relatively small town a county over from Sussex during the 90's.

We had no fewer than ten churches of varying denominations and I certainly grew up with Christian hymns and prayers being said in assembly.

But for all that, the only time someone has ever actually asked me what my religion was were two American Mormon missionaries.

One of the churches has since changed hands and turned into a mosque with absolutely no fuss.

We don't tend to be particularly loud about our religious beliefs, if we have any.
