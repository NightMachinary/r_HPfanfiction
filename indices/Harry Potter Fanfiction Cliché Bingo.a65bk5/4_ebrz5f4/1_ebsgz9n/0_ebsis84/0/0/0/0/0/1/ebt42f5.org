German here and we had a sharp downturn in registered Christians after the relatively recent hedonism and pedophilia scandals of the Catholic Church, but for most of the people who exited church in response to that it was just a wakeup call to actually make things official after not having gone to church for decades (apart from maybe Christmas and Easter.)

Very few people here are regular churchgoers, and that's not a recent development.
