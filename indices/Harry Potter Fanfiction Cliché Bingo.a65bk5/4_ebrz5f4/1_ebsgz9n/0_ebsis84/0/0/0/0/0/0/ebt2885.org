It's not a recent development, [[http://www.vexen.co.uk/UK/religion.html][according to this site]].

  Religion in Britain has suffered an immense general decline since the 1950s. Between 1979 and 2005, half of all Christians stopped going to church on a Sunday. Four in five britons want religion to be private, not public, and have no place in politics5. All indicators show a continued secularisation of British society in line with other European countries such as France.

It's one of the biggest differences between Western Europe and the USA - we really don't care about religion.
