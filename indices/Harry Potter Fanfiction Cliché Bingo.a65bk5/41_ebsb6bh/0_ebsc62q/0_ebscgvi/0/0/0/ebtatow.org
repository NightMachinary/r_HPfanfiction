A surprise prompt appears!

Hermione: Who are the new Slytherins?

Ron, while eating: What, those two blokes? Dunno. Say, when did Malfoy get so short?

Harry: I don't think he did, I think his bookends got tall.

Hermione: We're twelve, people don't get that tall over one summer.

Harry: Hermione, the Goblin healers that my family paid to check up on me in their sealed wills ended up giving me three nutrient potions, and now I'm over two meters tall.

Hermione: HADRIAN JAMES FLEAMONT POTTER That doesn't make sense!

Harry, leaning to see past her: Oh, they got abs too!
