Yay, Nightmares of Futures Past doesn't bingo :).

It has a few. "Mione" pops up occasionally, there's a main Potter family vault firmly out of sight, and Dumbledore initially refers to "Harry, my boy" - although I think he stops that later.

What constitutes "OP" occlumency? NoFP allows second years to keep Snape out of their heads with enough training (most of a year), but it's an obvious block rather than the subtle misdirection Snape was teaching in canon, and it doesn't stop the Sorting Hat, or Veritaserum.
