Actually, I disagree with this one. I think making there be something like 10 or 20 boys Harry's year, instead of the 5 we have, is completely necessary, because he wizarding world is just so damn small. You can just casually throw out names without hem necessarily needing to be important, just like how Dean and/or Seamus have maybe 2 lines in every fic, just to fill out a scene. Alternatively you can do a “war generation” thing to explain the low numbers, which I've seen a lot of fics do, but that usually has a much larger affect on the universe of your story, especially the political situation.
