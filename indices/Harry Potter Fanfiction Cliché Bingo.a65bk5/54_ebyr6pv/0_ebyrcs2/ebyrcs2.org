I think this one /can/ be used right, but very rarely is. Splitting your soul into Horcruxes 100% sounds like something that would degrade your mind and sanity, meaning that you can have both a charismatic Tom Riddle to build up a movement and an insane but incredibly powerful Voldemort to go on rampages and do nothing but cause chaos. A lot of stories do this, but the thing is that they still KEEP Voldemort as the main challenge to overcome. There needs to be another problem or conflict driving the story; stories where the main source of drama is at the equivalent mental level of a 3rd grader quickly stop being interesting.
