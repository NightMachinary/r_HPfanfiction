I think the "Voldemort cursed it" explanation is more likely. Pettigrew was always a coward, and he never had the stomach to do the dirty work himself. Looking his best friend's son in the eyes as he killed him would be something Peter would be hesitant to do.

Voldemort knew Pettigrew was an unreliable traitor who'd jump ship at the first hint of serious trouble, and I think it's likely that he cursed the hand as an extra form of security. Voldemort always kills traitors, as seen by his treatment of Regulus Black. It would be in character to curse the hand to kill Peter the moment his loyalties wavered.
