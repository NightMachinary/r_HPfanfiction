They are canon, but there's no real evidence of what they do. The closest we see to anything in canon is Pettigrew's death. Whether the life debt caused the silver hand to turn on him for honestly seeking to end Harry's life, or Voldemort put a curse on the hand that was activated by Pettigrew's hesitating due to the debt, it's never fully explained.

Basically, writers are given carte blanch to use it however they see fit.
