Not sure how you would trip over that one in a sentence, as a reader. Maybe 'illogical stop at station of canon'. e.g.: 'Yes, I know Harry killed Wormtail in that accidental magic Fiendfyre in chapter 23, but this is chapter 71, and he just caught Pettigrew leaving the Forbidden Forest so that Sirius can be proven innocent.'
