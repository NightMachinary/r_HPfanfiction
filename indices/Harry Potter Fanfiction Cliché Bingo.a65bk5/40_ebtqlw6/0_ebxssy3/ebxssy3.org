"You die from lack of magic if you aren't bonded to a wizard?" Harry questioned incredulously.\\
Dobby nodded, "Yes, Master Harry, that is why house-elves must be slaves."

*Later...*\\
"Dobby, can't you wear something less revealing than that teatowel? We could go shopping at Diagon Alley..."\\
Dobby shook his head, "I am being sorry, Master Harry, but house-elves must not wear proper clothes. 'Tis a sign of their enslavement."

*Later...*\\
Harry raised an eyebrow, "A collar and shackles, Dobby? Really?"\\
Dobby blushed a little, "Um...yes, these are also a symbol of a house-elf's enslavement."\\
"And the reason why I haven't seen any other house-elves in chains before?" Harry asked wryly.\\
Dobby's eyes flicked back and forth, "Um...because Dobby was dismissed by bad master Malfoy. Shackles are only for bad elves who disobeyed their old masters."

*Later...*\\
"A chastity belt? Really?" Harry asked with a raised eyebrow, holding up the device that Hedwig had just delivered.\\
Dobby blushed bright red for a few seconds, before he answered, "Dobby is not allowed to do.../that thing/ with other elves until he's proven himself with years of service to his new master."\\
"Riiiiight." Harry drawled, unconvinced.

*Later...*\\
"A gag, Dobby? Let me guess, 'house-elves must learn that they aren't allowed to speak without their master's permission' or something like that?"\\
The currently-muted Dobby nodded.

*Later...*\\
"Dobby, be honest with me." Harry began, holding up a whip and a paddle that had just been delivered in the mail, "Are you making all this stuff up about house-elf enslavement to get me to go along with your kinks?"\\
Dobby blushed brighter than he had ever blushed before, before ever-so-slightly nodding his head.\\
Harry just sighed, "I expected as much...but I'm putting you on a budget now, understand? No spending more than 1 galleon a week on your 'toys'."
