"Malfoy can't get into the Room of Requirement?" Hermione said, pacing the common room. "How is that even possible?"

"I sealed the room, but it isn't foolproof. He can still collect the key, which I've broken into seven pieces and scattered across the castle. Once he's gathered them all, he'll realize that he didn't need a key. The true key was within him all along."

"...and cannot access the room where he's keeping all of his materials until he completes a quest," Lucius finished his report, placing a kiss on the hem of my robes.

"Hm. What sort of quest?" I asked.

"He must retrieve seven keys, hidden in Hogwarts," Lucius said.

I raised an eyebrow. "Are you sure the key isn't already in him?"

--------------

Draco growled at me and, with a burst of light, the pieces united into an ornate, silver key. He stomped towards the door and stuck it into the lock.

The key broke, its pieces disappearing, and the door remained closed.

The blond whirled around, glowering. "It broke."

I hurried forward. "Draco, don't you deserve to get in?"

Draco sneered. "Of course I do. I did all your stupid trials."

"And learned so many lessons," I mused. "If you truly deserve to go in, then why would you need a key?"

"You're kidding me," he said flatly.

I placed a hand on his shoulder. "Draco, open the door."

Young Malfoy turned the knob and the door smoothly opened.

"You see?" I said. "The true key was within you all along. All you had to do was believe in yourself!"

Draco gazed into the Room of Requirement, which was empty save for the pedestal holding Ravenclaw's Diadem. "I spent a year and a half tracking down the key pieces, all for a key that I didn't need."

I chuckled, pushing past him. "Just because the key doesn't open the door doesn't mean you don't need the key."
