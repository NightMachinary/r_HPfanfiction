I bet it's still taxing, on some level. You'd need stamina of some kind, be it physical or magical, and you'd still need to train.

I concede your point, you can get out of dodging if you are adept at dueling and/or magically powerful enough to always block or shield or parry. But I think we're making a point about the superiority complex that comes with jogging around a lake for a semester. Surely that'll give an edge against Voldemort himself, who can transfigure large objects in a blink. (Transfiguration being the hardest to master, or so I hear?)

I could see all the running translate to something like this, but not much else (as I myself run a 10k regularly):

/Harry, Hermione and Ron slowed to a stop, huffing and panting, leaning against a large ash tree. As they looked around them, they could no longer see the attackers./

/"Did we... outrun them completely?" Hermione asked between large intakes of breath/

/"Blimey, mate! Those four minute miles sure are paying off!" Exclaimed an out of breath Ron. He could spy half a dozen black figures, small as dots, appearing on the horizon "But let's get out of here for real, all right?"/

/He extended a hand to Harry and Hermione, taking in their puzzled expressions. He shot a glance at the brunette girl that could be translated to "Are you a witch or not" before grasping both of his friends and apparating away./

Running only gives you stamina, but no other athletic skills for dodging, which I rarely see any drills being practiced of. It's either jogging, or target practice, or pointlessly complicated duels that don't focus on immediately overpowering and subduing your opponent. I feel like yeah, to a certain point you'd have to be physically able to take someone down, or at least assist the magical side of attacks with a swift kick to the shin, but then you'd also have to practice being ruthless. Not toying with your opponent by conjuring */birds/*, but sending a cutting curse at them and send them down hard so they stay down.

So, TLDR: Dodge and escape if you encounter an opponent with superior magical capacity. Shield and go on the offence otherwise.
