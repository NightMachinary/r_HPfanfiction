If there's time travel involved I don't see why not. Makes more sense than most of that Harry/Bellatrix or Harry/Snape stuff that keeps floating around. McGonagall was probably pretty awesome when she was younger.

Honestly, all this really makes me want to read a fic about Minerva back when she was a student at Hogwarts. Has anyone ever done something like that?
