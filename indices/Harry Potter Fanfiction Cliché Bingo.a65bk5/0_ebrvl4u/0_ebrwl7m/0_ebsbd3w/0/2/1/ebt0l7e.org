I've read one, maybe someone will remember the title. McGonagall de-aged herself with the help of a potion and befriended Harry, eventually becoming more than friends. She called herself Black Owl or Something-Owl, I don't remember exactly. She had to stop using the potion because of some health issue, and they ended up mindwiping Harry to think she had to move away or something so he wouldn't learn the truth.
