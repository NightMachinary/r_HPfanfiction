Governments would design a phased approach that included employing large numbers of graduates as teachers for a national curriculum approved 'magic' class to be taught in public schools.

Production would ramp up on materials such as wand bearing components, and a long phase approach would be taken to disclose both the existence of magic and their childrens abilities. basically by the time their magic matures ten years later and they formally disclose the confirmed proof and policy changes the general public will be tired of the subject and just continue on.
