Why not go the old curse route like tens of thousands of years ago everyone was magical and then for some reason most of the world was cursed to not be able to interact with magic and muggleborns have been people that the curse just didn't take hold on.

And then in the year 2020 the goblins of Gringotts loot the ancient runins were the curse that suppressed the majority of the world magic was cast. The curse breakers do their job breaking the curse and suddenly every muggle, Non-magical animal and planet,ect suddenly has their magic unsuppressed.

The muggle world then has to learn how to deal with not only their population suddenly developing magic but also all the plants,animal the world and environment in general with thing like magic storms and natural disasters.
