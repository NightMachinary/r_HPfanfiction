There are about 130-140 million people born every year worldwide, and around 350-400 thousand born every day - last I recall, the outer limit estimate on the number of Magical people in the world (of all blood types) is about 25 million. Even if every single member of the current magical community became a teacher, there'd not be enough people to teach the new additions. They couldn't even get them all a wand. I imagine the drastic increase in demand and non-commensurate increase in supply, magical resources would drain immensely fast.

You'd also have to have every animal birth or plant germination be magical too, just to be able to keep up.
