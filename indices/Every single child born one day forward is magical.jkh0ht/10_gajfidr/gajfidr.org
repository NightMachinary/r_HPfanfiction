This is legitamately terrifying when you think about it.

This wouldn't be a scenario where every muggle on the planet adapted to wizarding life. Rather, magic would be the one adapting to muggle life. Wizarding problems like blood discrimination would virtually vanish because all the people who gave a shit and have the power to enforce their viewpoint are now vastly outnumbered. Wizarding life would change completely to become "muggleized". No more old clothes, old castles, and everyone will be scrambling to make technology work with magic.

Not to mention prevalent muggle issues. Racism, sexism, terrorism, wars, riots, school shootings, organized crime. Those don't go away, they just replace blood purity. And definitely for the worst. Its not just one radical wizard running around killing babies in magical Britain anymore. Every nation across the globe has an entire population of people who could kill with the swish of a stick. If wizarding society sucked so bad with only one major issue (blood purity) and on such a small scale, it'll be pretty bad news if applied to billions of people who hate eachother based on things like race and religion.

Basically like the cold war all over again. All it takes is one nation utilizing magic as a means of mass destruction and bam you got another world war on your hands.

Also, at first a lot of those kids could be turned into child soldiers.

And a lot of people would go untrained in their magic too, making them dangerous if it acts up.

Totally easier to murder people in general, actually.

Theres a lot of terrible things that would happen if everyone got magic all of sudden Iol.
