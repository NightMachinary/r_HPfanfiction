While I do see racism being a problem, sexism would have to virtually disappear with magic. Magic is a great equalizer as it is far more effective and versatile compared to physical strength. Both sexes would gain an effectively equal ability to defend themselves, so sexism /should/ virtually disappear or at the very least be vastly toned down.
