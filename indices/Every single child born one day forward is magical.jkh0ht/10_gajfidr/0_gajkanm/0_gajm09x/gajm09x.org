I could see that happening, but only after a couple generations a least. Sexism isn't tied only to physical strength after all. It's part of culture. A woman being able to curse someone as well as a man doesn't mean a woman can recieve equal employment oppurtunities, pay, or be recognized by society as a complete equal. Expectations and gender roles are deeply rooted. Magical power would be a gateway to equal rights, but it's not an instant or easy thing. It would just be a tool. It would take decades of trail blazers and a fight for equality to eventually change the culture enough through each successive generation. More so for the nations with an already restrictive and rigid culture.

But I could see it speeding things up. It's easier to organize meetings, marches, distribute informative material, and show examples of feminism if the organizers could fend off those who want to stop them.

Edit: sorry for the rant I'm sorta a history and sociology nerd so i like the what-ifs lol
