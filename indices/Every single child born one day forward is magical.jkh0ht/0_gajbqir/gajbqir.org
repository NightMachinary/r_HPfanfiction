Consider that there is in no way the resources to properly teach every magical child, based on the current infrastructure. So, who would be taught? Are you going to choose at random? No. Those with the connections to secure a spot, Purebloods and Halfbloods would be taught magic. The new muggleborns would probably be left in the dust. Would there even be enough wands for them all? Probably not. Durmstung doesn't even accept muggleborns. Most of them would never be told they're magical, I imagine. The statute of secrecy would be a bust, soon enough, even if the muggleborns are never informed of their magic. The sheer volume of accidental magic would be impossible to hide. Soon enough, you have those who do know magic, and those who don't. And let's be honest, magic is a gamebreaker for the wizards vs muggles debate. Now, there's two ways this can go. One, they expand the wizarding world to eventually teach everyone magic. it's super dope. Or, what I consider vastly more probable, those with power(magic) do their best to retain their monopoly on it, and society enters a strict caste system. Those who are taught magic, and those who are not. But, those who have magic, but know not how to harness it are the majority. Eventually, knowledge would get out. Even if the upper caste do their best to ensure it does not, over the course of years or decades, it would. And the lower caste would revolt, and probably win, ensuring free knowledge for everyone. Or they begin their own tyrannical reign. Or they lose, and deal with dragonhide boots stomping on their faces forever.
