Oh man, that could make an amazing story. McGonagall (And the other hogwarts staff) forming a group, desperately trying to get the government/world ready for the sudden influx. They have to deal with naysayers who claim the book (or whatever tracks magical children) is broken and refuse to take action. They have to deal with purebloods who attempt to use to this barr muggleborns from wizarding society, citing scarcity (iirc it was the Whig party in Britain which cited Malthusian theory to perpetuate the inevitability of scarcity in order to justify large wealth gaps and hating poor people). The obliviators are worked to the bone, desperately trying to keep up the masquerade and governmental and societal pressure forces them to keep quiet. I recently watched The Normal Heart (which broke mine) Which is about a gay men's health group desperately trying to raise awareness/funding/help against AIDs despite the government refusing to take it seriously or even take notice of the death toll. I think that kind of tone could work well. Though, I don't think I could write it lol.
