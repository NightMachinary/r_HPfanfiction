Well, that's a super depressing, though valid, take on this, lol.

There definitely would need to be a lot of changes that would need to be made for that first option, which was how I had been thinking this would go. That's kinda why my idea was to have McGonagall discover this by checking the book of magical births. Presumably she'd check it at least once a year, so that would give the magical world 10 years to prepare before having to deal with magical schooling on a wide spread, global population basis.

How long does it take to make a wand? Would wand makers be able to craft enough in those 10 years? Or would they choose to spend a few years teaching others how to craft wands, so they can start crafting more as well? Or maybe, just due to the numbers involved, it becomes no longer viable to craft wands beforehand and match them to a person (think of how long it took Ollivander to match Harry to his wand, then multiple that across three quarters of a million people - there might not even be enough time in a year to match all of them), so they would have to craft wands on an individual basis, for a person. All this would need to be figured out.

And then you need to do this same thing, thinking through all the consequences of needing to expand the magical government/system to work on a country wide scale, for every career/resource that is needed for the magical world. Combining modern medicine and healers, dealing with magical crime on a country wide basis, ensuring there's enough plant and animal resources for potions to be anywhere near as wide spread as it had been.
