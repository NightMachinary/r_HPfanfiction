There would probably be a magical arms race. If you have some good wizards, it doesn't matter how advanced a security system is. Conversely, you need wizards to defend against other enemy wizards. Another factor of the arms race would be who can produce the most/best magical resources. If there's a forest that has the most of x, you can bet lots of different groups will be fighting over it, similar to a cold war
