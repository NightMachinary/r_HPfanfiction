What actually causes children of wizards and witches to be magical? Is it something in the DNA? Some other property of the cells? Or does it happen during the development in the womb?

A morally dubious wizard with access to test subjects, genetics expert and an IVF clinic could probably do things such as DNA from nonmagical parents in cells from magical parents and the other way around to narrow it down. Once it's figured out which conditions exactly result in magical offspring, it might be possible to artificially produce those conditions at scale.

For example if it's not DNA and the child being magical depends on how magical the sperm and ova cells are plus random fluctuation, then it might be possible to get a witch to donate ova cells, duplicate them somehow and increase potency, then remove the nucleus and replace them with nuclei from nonmagical test tube embryos, and the result would be a magical clone of the muggle embryo, resulting in a magical child with DNA from muggle parents. Therefore growing the magical population without the small gene pool issue. If the approach can be done safely and at scale, there'll probably be more than enough parents who'd pay a few grand to give their child magical abilities to double the population.
