In case anyone else was wondering about the math, there were [[https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/vitalstatisticspopulationandhealthreferencetables][about 730,000 births in the UK in 2018]], which is about 2000 births/day. [[https://www.statista.com/statistics/281977/live-births-in-the-united-kingdom-uk-1961-1990/][The numbers were pretty similar around Harry's time]].

It's not really clear how many students are at Hogwarts. Rowling once said it was about 1000, but she is notoriously bad at math. Most estimates I've seen put the number at about 250-700 based on various numbers in the books. But they definitely wouldn't be able to handle 2000 first years if they didn't prepare for it. Fortunately, the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad would almost certainly have taken note of the massive upswing in accidental magic years before that.
