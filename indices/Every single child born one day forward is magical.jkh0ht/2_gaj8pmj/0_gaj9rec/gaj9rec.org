Oh, I meant every single child from that point forward forever, not just the one day. So 3/4th of a million first years, not 2000, hah.

With numbers like these, I don't know if it would even be possible for there to be enough wizards and witches to field a single teacher at all the schools necessary, much less one for each subject.

Maybe normal schools would just do the basics to teach kids how to control their magic, to avoid accidental magic, and other less directly magic using subjects, until they graduate. And then learning more advanced OWL/NEWT level magic would be treated as more of a trade school thing, taught to people who are interested and want to make a career out of it, not everybody in whatever the British version of high school is called (secondary?).
