Considering this is fanfiction, what happens if you go back in time to kill either Tom or Harry (or their parents Terminator-style) before the prophecy was even made? Time-travel is pretty common trope here.

Here is a thought: if either must die at the hand of the other, does that mean they can't commit suicide? And did Voldemort really die at Harry's hand, since technically he cast the killing curse /both/ times that killed him?

linkffn(Realignment): I have six words for you: Tom Riddle, the Boy Who Lived.
