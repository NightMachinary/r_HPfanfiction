/Moments after Indy!Harry fatally wounds Manipulative!Dumbledore with a powerful withering curse/

â€‹

"Harry my boy, I'm so sorry for all that I've done to you, but for the prophesy to be fulfilled you had to truly mean it."

'What are you talking about?'

"Harry, I'm the Dark Lord of the prophesy. I always was."

/Harry gapes at the manipulative old goat, having absolutely no clue what to do with this news/

'But you said the Prophesy was about Voldemort?'

"Harry, Sibyl could not have given the prophesy to me if I was not part of it. I needed you to hate me, to destroy me. That's why I had to make the decisions that I have, why I had to do things I'll never get the chance to forgive myself for."

'But why? The prophesy never said we had to be enemies, only that I'd be your equal, that I'd have the power to potentially defeat you!'

"Neither can live while the other survives, Harry. So long as I live you can not defeat Tom."
