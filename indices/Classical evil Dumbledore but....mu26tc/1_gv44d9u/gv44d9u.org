It's extremely unpopular here, but in HPMOR Harry and Dumbledore clash a lot, particularly over Snape, the two's different opinions on Death, and a number of other issues, and Harry suspects at points that Dumbledore was insane.

And then it turns out that Dumbledore was walking on a tightrope of prophesy with the world at stake the whole time, and HJPEV's indy moments were often fuckups, which he only learns after he basically accidentally got Dumbledore killed.
