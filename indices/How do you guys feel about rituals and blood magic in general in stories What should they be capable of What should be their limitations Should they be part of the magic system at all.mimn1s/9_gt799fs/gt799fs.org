Personally I feel rituals should always pay little bit of homage to pagan rituals, and blood magic should toe the line between horrific backlash if done wrong and always has a price ,do not preform the magic unless you are willing to pay the toll. I also feel ritualistic magic and blood magic are not everyday Magics they should be portrayed as what, they were thought of back in the day. Magic that is to be feared and respected and not used for trivial things.
