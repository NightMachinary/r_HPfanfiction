There has to be a real reason why it's not used by everyone. In my headcanon 95% of ancient rituals have a modern spell equivalent that's just as good if not better and way more convenient. Basically it's easier to flick your wand than to dance in a circle for ten minutes. The few legal use cases for rituals are mostly very specific things that aren't needed often enough to be worth the effort of developing a spell.

The rituals that do have powerful effects have to be very costly in terms of sacrifice and everything with living sacrifice would be very illegal.

Dark magic refers to several things that are illegal, have negative effects for the user, are only usable for evil purposes, and/or combinations thereof. Many powerful spells need certain emotions like the Patronus requiring happiness. The spells needing anger are the easiest to master because it's easy to be angry and they yield powerful destructive effects. Most don't even magically corrupt the user, just the pavlovian conditioning of connecting being angry with success is enough to wreak havoc on the users mental health.
