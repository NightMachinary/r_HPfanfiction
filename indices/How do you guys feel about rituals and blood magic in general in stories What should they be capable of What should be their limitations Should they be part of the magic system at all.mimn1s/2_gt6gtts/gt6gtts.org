I personally /love/ rituals, but only as long as they focus on the cost of it as well. Even non-dark rituals. In my current WiP, all wizards age extremely slowly, with the most powerful ones aging even slower, and Dumbledore pretty much cut his lifespan 90% to bind with a phoenix so he could defeat Grindelwald.

However, I feel like freely using them makes a character boringly OP unless they're up against similar opponents (the Black Queen series by Silently watches comes to mind, Jennifer and Dumbledore combined can't stand up to Voldemort, and her ritual worship fits in very nicely with the plot). My story's Harry will never use them because he's aware that he's nowhere near smart enough to not get fucked by them.

I generally feel like to have rituals you have to have some form of magical deities, and their potential power directly linked to said deities, which have their own restrictions. So for instance, a ritual to death could piece Voldemort back together or raise a whole graveyard of undead, but it couldn't bring back the dead.

It's something that fanfic authors tend to forget often - unless it's the main focus of a story, unlimited power is only interesting for about two chapters. And rituals are one of the things where authors tend to forget this, simply using them as a metaphorical rock falling from the ceiling to crush Harry's problems.
