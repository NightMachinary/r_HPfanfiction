Like is the general consensus ritual magic in the hp universe is awesome. I'd love to see more non blood related though. Like hangovers from a pre roman/pre christian era. Like it always makes me sad that there is no samhain celebrations/rituals that honor the dead. There are lots of inspirations. Course this leads me to a frustrating pack of wizarding culture. Boo. Anyway. Rituals are awesome.
