I like the way 'The Archeologist' by Racke did a nice inclusion of ritual magic and if I had to use ritual magic in my own work, it'd be something similar.

As for blood magic, there's an argument for it. The concept of blood having power is not new to fantasy or even mythology. Pretty sure a voodoo /fetish/ with the blood of the person your making it of will stronger than if it's just the /fetish/.

I think it's limitations should be like that. Offensibly to directly affectva person. Keying things to an individuals blood is not a nee idea, but is probably fine, though a ward blood-keyed might be immediately dangerous to *anything* not of that blood. (Rip stray kittys). Tracking. Blood trackers are also not new in "fanon". I could see blood as a fuel for runes as blood would contain magic used to power/charge runes. I don't think it makes sense for blood to power up normal spells. Though it could be a component of a spell. Think the Blood Gorger from "Wind Sheer" by Chilord. It was a spell that targeted blood, drained the victim of their blood and the used that blood to "reach" more victims.

In the end though, fanfiction is a realm of infinite possibilities where the limits are only defined by yourself. If you think it makes sense and can justify it, go for it. "Fanon" is a bs word that shouldn't exist. You do you, and people will either hate or enjoy your work.
