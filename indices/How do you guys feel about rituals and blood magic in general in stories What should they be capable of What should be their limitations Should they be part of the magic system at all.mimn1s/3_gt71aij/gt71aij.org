My thoughts on ritual magic:

1. It can do things that ordinary spells can't, especially from a single caster.
2. It's difficult and complex - you might end up reciting minutes-long incantations, and even one flubbed syllable could break the whole thing.
3. It's risky - there's a lot of power involved, and if you screw up that power still has to go /somewhere./
4. It comes with a price, whether in the form of symbolic offerings or actual sacrifice.
5. The cost and complexity of the ritual can be used to offset each other - the more you're willing to sacrifice, the simpler the ritual becomes. Conversely, a particularly skillful ritualist can get away at minimal cost, because they're effectively sacrificing the time, effort, and risk required to pull off something so complex.

   1. Voldemort's resurrection ritual was kept simple by heavy-duty sacrifice: Pettigrew maimed himself, plus took Harry's blood; Voldebaby got dropped in a scalding-hot cauldron; the potion in the cauldron was probably made using evil like human sacrifice or rendering a unicorn down into a liquid (yes, I'm taking that from a fic, A Marauder's Plan IIRC).
