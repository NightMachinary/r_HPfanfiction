I like them quite a lot - I think they add a lot of potential/depth to the world, and should certainly be a part of the magic system (they are in canon), though not necessarily explored in great detail.

In terms of how they operate, I tend to view them as distinct from wand magic - perhaps predating it on the whole. But where the idea is that it's using magic in different, more complicated ways - where there's potentially a lot more potency than the wand magic generally taught at Hogwarts (eg - Voldemort making himself an entirely new body), but also a lot more inflexible (the specific requirements to make said new body, and a ritual like that presumably needing specific changes if doing, say, a body for an animal or a clone or the like, whereas a wand spell would be more flexible).

There's a lot of methods to make them work - one that I particularly enjoyed was in linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings), which uses a mix of runes, blood magic, and rituals for its main focus (basically, rituals done under the sun/moon at specific times that include carving runes with blood magic on the user, with a lot of it being around intent). It's interesting - powerful, but also with extremely obvious dangers and shows why it's considered dark/why most people would stick to wands.

Not all rituals and blood magic need to be powerful/huge things, either - by predating wand magic, perhaps there'd be a lot of inconsequential rituals that people still do from time to time, or that are still in the books. Like instead of being able to unlock a door with a simple spell, there'd be a ritual that takes some circuitous route to doing the same thing - or instead of the patronus, maybe there was some earlier, less convenient way of driving dementors off. It's similar to the potential of runes as a system (which I view as working best when having a lot of those same constraints).

In general though, I think authors should not make them super powerful and with no drawback - wand magic is the core of Harry Potter magic, and any other type being used should have some consideration given to why it isn't the default kind.
