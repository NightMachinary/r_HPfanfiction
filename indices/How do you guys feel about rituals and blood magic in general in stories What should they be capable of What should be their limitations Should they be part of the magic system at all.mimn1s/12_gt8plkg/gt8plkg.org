I quite like it.

I think there's few limits to what it's possible to achieve with it, but conversely, the more the ritual do, the harder it is to do it or the more it takes from you.

Lily's ritual imprinted her protection on Harry's blood and it required her willing life to work. It protected him from an unstoppable curse. Voldemort, on the other hand, was semi-alive and "only" needed a body, so a life wasn't needed in exchange. Yet, he needed bones from a dead man HE had killed, a maimed hand and blood from his enemy.

I also believe it shouldn't be used lightly. The character doing it needs to be magically strong, mentally strong and smart. I don't see it as dark magic necessarily, but just like the unforgivables, intent in required for it to work and the stronger the wizard, the stronger the ritual. They should be magically strong because it's ancient magic, wands won't be used, and mentally because it will probably take a long time in preparation, require attention to the smallest detail.

One more reason why I don't think it should be used lightly is because it will probably require a sacrifice of some sort, which is probably illegal, so I'd say it's a greater need kinda thing.

Again, there's already a ritual to create zombie like creatures, to anchor your soul, to make someone semi-invulnerable, to bring back to life... I think these pretty much show how there are few limits to it. But i also don't think they'd be able to make someone more powerful, or more skillful, it wouldn't conjur an army, or erase someone's existence. It works with things it can be connected to: a corpse for an inferi, an object/being for an horcrux, a body to the homunculus, a protection to a child, a house for wards, blood for protection, someone's magic/life for a promise...

And lastly, authors just make it more interesting, expand the possibilities. It's already cannon and part of the magic system of Harry Potter. So yeah, I'm all for it.
