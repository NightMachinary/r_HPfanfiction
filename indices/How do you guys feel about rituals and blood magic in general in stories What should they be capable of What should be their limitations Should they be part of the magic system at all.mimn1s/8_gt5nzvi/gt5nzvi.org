In linkffn(Double Time) blood magic is described by future Hermione as a very grey area, which is looked down upon because of its /potential/ dark use. In a later chapter, blood magic is put into a good light when it's used to cleanse the Locket of the Horcrux (using 30 millilitres of virgin blood, iirc)

I really liked this interpretation. It makes great sense imo
