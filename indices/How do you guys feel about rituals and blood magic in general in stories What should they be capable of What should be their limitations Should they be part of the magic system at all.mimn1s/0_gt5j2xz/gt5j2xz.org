Personally, I like blood magic because it's interesting and pretty much entirely fanon, so people can go in entirely different directions

But the limits, I think should be that it's more big rituals or stuff with larger magical implications, like instead of using blood to make something levitate, instead you should be using blood to create portals and such, or communicate with the dead, or make a child biologically yours without having conceived them, something that's larger and that you're not really able to do with normal magic.

I also feel like if it's a ritual for intentions, it shouldn't react right away. Like, if it's a ritual to give yourself everlasting good luck, it should start small and then slowly get bigger, you know, building up.
