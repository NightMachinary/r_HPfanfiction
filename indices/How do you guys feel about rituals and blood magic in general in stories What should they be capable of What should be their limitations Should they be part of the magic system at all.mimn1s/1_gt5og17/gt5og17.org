I consider Ritual and Blood Magic as canon because, in my opinion, both Voldemort resurection and Lily protection were a kind of both, which means that they are already part of the magic system.

But even if they exist, people almost exclusively use wands for a reason and rituals/ blood magic should either be significantly weaker than wand magic, or only useful in some /very/ specific situation. Which is why people generaly don't bother anymore, not to mention a lot of rituals would use "sacrifice", which are kinda banned by the Ministry (if not the ICW), the trade off sacrifice/ benefice is also rarely worth it.

As an example, someone may be able to create a source of water, but the ritual takes around 10h and necessite to burn several materials, which makes it kinda useless when /Aguamenti/ exist. Another wizards could also raise his physical strenght using a Norse ritual, but it would take a month, necessite a loooooot of ingredients plus the sacrifice of a beast. But any error during the ritual would kill the wizard, he would also take some mental characteristic of the beast making him more savage (a berserk), and the physical increase is kinda negligible (like +10%), for a ritual than can only be done once.

So yeah, I have nothing against rituals, I even like them a little but it's a bit boring in a fanfic when Harry just have to draw a circle on the floor and say 3 sentences in Gaelic to "multiply by 2 his magical core". I prefer when they are generaly a chore and only useful into a very specific situation where the average wizard would never find himself in. I really like the fanon explanation how what Lily used during Halloween was a ritual, where she sacrificied her life (and maybe James' too) to protect Harry againt one thing : Voldemort.
