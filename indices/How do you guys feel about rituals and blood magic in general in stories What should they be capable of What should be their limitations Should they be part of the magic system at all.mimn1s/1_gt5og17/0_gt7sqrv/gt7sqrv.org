I like some of what you say here but I definitely think ritual magic can be stronger than their wanded counterparts. Obviously everyday magic would be stupid slow with ritual magic (can you imagine molly weasley cleaning with ritual magic?! Lol ). Some rituals would benefit from the use of a wand, while others... Actually I lost my train of thought. Lol TL:DR rituals are a fantastic way to add magic to the hp world. Also I agree it was Lily who is the savior. Oh and I'm thinking the ministry either bans or at least derides rituals as dark magic bc you can't track it like you can a wand.
