I personally find them very interesting and love reading about them in fics.

The general understanding I have of rituals is they need blood of course and any sort of blood magic (or majority of blood magic) is Dark magic which is why they aren't taught in school and I think the only person we know who used a blood magic ritual in canon was Voldemort. He wasn't the one to actually perform his resurrection but the fact that we see no one else ever performing rituals in canon, I'm lead to believe it's either really difficult to do or super risky (which makes sense why Voldemort would do it, he loves to perform complex magic that is not recommended to attempt).

Another thing I noticed about rituals is they're always performed on special grounds. Voldemort's resurrection was performed in a graveyard, I read a fic where it was done in the Death Chamber at the Ministry. Most that i've read in fics they are done on earth either deep below ground or in a forest clearing, so I'm assuming the earth element is either a requirement or increase your chances of success. So I guess some area heavy with the presence of death is ideal for resurrection but otherwise the earth element is also a good source?

Sorry for the rambling I just dumped all my observations about rituals and barely answered any questions you had ðŸ˜­
