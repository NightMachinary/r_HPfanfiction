I don't recall a fic where Dumbledore sets the Goblins on Harry but I do recall a fic where Harry has the goblins join to fight against Voldemort in the final battle. The problem is that Dumbledore arranged for Aragog and his children to attack and kill anything on the outside of the Hogwart's wards. And of course, the Goblins arrive outside the wards so Harry and company leave the safety of the wards (one way only) to help their Goblin Allies. The story is called When Fate Intervened by LordVishnu.
