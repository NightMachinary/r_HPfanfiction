Grades wise yeah he's mostly average only excelling in DADA (debatably could be Ron's influence, most visible in his choice of electives). Power wise, well we don't quite get a lot of proper comparisons aside from him beating Voldemort at Priori Incantatem, his casting patronus in 3rd year when many NEWT students supposedly can't cast it (albeit that could be some kind of skill/talent instead of raw power, and then he teaches a bunch of kids in the DA which waters this one down), and that he pulls off two of the three Unforgivables with only some minor difficulty.

One major thing to keep in mind is that Harry **wants\** to be average, and as 95% of the books follow his perspective, I suspect that tints the narrative somewhat.
