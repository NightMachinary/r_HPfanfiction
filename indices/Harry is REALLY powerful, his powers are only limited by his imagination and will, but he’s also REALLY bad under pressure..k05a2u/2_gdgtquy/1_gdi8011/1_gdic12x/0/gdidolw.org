I think we've got a good idea. In DH, Voldemort manhandles McGonagall, Flitwick and Shacklebolt at the same time, and Harry was giving him a fight even without the Brother Wands.

As for teaching the other students, Harry got his down very quickly in PoA, he just struggled to use it with the memory effect. Teaching it isn't hard, it's being able to use it when in the presence of Dementors which most of them couldn't in DH. He, comparatively, did it even with a few dozen focused solely on him.

I think the problem isn't just Harry's confidence issues, it's that he compares himself to the likes of Dumbledore and Voldemort and even Hermione, with their wider knowledge of magic, and doesn't realise his own strengths in combat magic and combat.
