I agree. I think part of his forced mediocrity is his desire to be normal combined with the fact that the books are from his perspective and he sees himself as “just Harry”. He also doesn't really push himself in subjects that he doesn't enjoy. I think overall Canon Harry is more of a people person. When his loved ones are in danger or the world in general, he can summon massive amounts of power from nowhere to protect them, but the everyday stuff he has to work at. He enjoys socializing more than schoolwork and is great at teaching and leading.
