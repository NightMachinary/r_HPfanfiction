There's an old fic by Jeconnais called "this means war". It's not on ao3 or ffn, buy if you Google for it it'll pop up. Everyone communicates by email (Mail, excuse me) and Harry's denseness is practically a super power - he can do anything because he doesn't know any different.

The "really bad in a crisis" bit doesn't come into play here.
