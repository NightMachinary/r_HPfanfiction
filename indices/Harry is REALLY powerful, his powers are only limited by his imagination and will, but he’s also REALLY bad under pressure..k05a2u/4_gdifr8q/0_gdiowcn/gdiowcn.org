As humorous as this is, the law is that you can't conjure or transfigure real food. Any food you do conjure is practically empty, lacking any nutrients, and permanent transfiguration is really really hard, so it wouldn't be worth trying on food. Any partial transfiguration from, say, a plate into a steak would turn back later, cutting up your stomach with shards of plate. So yeah, don't magic the food.
