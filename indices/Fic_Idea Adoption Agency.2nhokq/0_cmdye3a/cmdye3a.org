DLP has a [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=24752][Plot Bunny thread]] - tons of ideas there, but from what I understand they're not "up for grabs" so much as they are meant to be shared, tinkered with, and then written (or not) by the original poster. I might be getting that wrong, though. Maybe a more experienced user of that site can take it from here?
