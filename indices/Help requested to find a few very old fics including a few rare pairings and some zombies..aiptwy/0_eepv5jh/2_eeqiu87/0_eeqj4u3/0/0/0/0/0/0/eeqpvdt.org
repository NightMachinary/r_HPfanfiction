Like I said, I'm just a creepy stalker :) I saw on her LJ that she mentioned a book and linked to amazon, from there I found her real name and just searched it alongside 'Lazarus', and that led me to her Facebook account. There was also some info in her amazon seller page about her as a person, and tbh her life sounds awesome! I'm going to try contacting her too, to let her know how much I loved Wake the Dead (and I'm sure a lot of her others as soon as I finish them!)
