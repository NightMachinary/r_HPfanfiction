There was a big ffn purge for smut and other dark themes. If I remember right some of it started with a fic called [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/4220/1][Lust or Love]]. It's a good fic that got reported and spawned a few new sites like the now closed unknowable room. If you haven't read it I do suggest it. It's a James and Lily story but a little unconventional.

All the dates on these posts are making me feel very old.

I think Syn ended up moving into real original fiction. I have vague memories of preview chapters of a book being put on her site at one point. I hope that's true but it was a long time ago so I could be confused.

Either way I hope they notice a spike in live journal traffic and realize their stories made an impact. Obviously I remember them fondly after almost 15 years.

Thank you again! It's been a really shit week and this was just a big pick me up ðŸ˜Š
