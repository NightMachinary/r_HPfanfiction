  I think Syn ended up moving into real original fiction.

Because I'm +an incredibly creepy weirdo+ +a stalker+ very inquisitive, I found out that Syn is [[https://www.amazon.com/C.-J.-Baker/e/B004RKH368/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1][C.J. Baker]], author of quite a few books that look well-received if not widely known, and she was active (at least in putting her books on amazon) as of early 2017. Her FB hasn't had a post since 2013, but it could just be set to private after that.

That being said, we could probably get in contact with her and let her know how much staying power her older works have! :)

Hope your week just gets better and better, [[/u/greenmoss101][u/greenmoss101]] ! <3
