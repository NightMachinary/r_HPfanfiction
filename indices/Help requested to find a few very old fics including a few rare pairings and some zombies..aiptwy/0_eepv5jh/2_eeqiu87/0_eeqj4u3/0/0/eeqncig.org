I remember hearing about a ffn purge in the past - but it had occurred after I briefly abandoned the site. Came back a year or two ago and UGH, it looked so weird and I couldn't find a lot of old things that used to be there.

Wake the Dead left me feeling so...I suppose not 'unnerved' but just shocked? I wasn't expecting a happily ever after, per se, but I wasn't expecting THAT either. I loved it - I don't see much stuff like that around.

The Company Ink wasn't my cup of tea but I'm diving into some of Syn's other stuff now. I wonder whatever happened to Syn, if he/she is still active somewhere or is a redditor, even..
