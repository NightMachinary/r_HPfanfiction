Aw, that's great that you like them!

So I found these I think my senior year of high school which was forever ago. I was very very very deep in the internet looking for fanfic after a lot of good stuff was purged from ffn.

If I remember right, this author is prolific and very very good. The Wake the Dead fic might honestly be one of the first zombie cross overs with Harry Potter and just took my breath away. Once I saw your edit about the site name it all came rushing back though. The author also did some great fanart which I'm digging for now.

This is just so wonderful and a blast from the past. I'm so glad I found this sub while googling myself!
