Totally agree! I think part of it is most of these were written, I believe, before Luna turned up in the movies. Evanna Lynch is amazing as Luna which makes it hard to not imagine her when reading the books now or thinking about the character in general for writing a new take.

It's interesting to see a version of her from before Evanna's take on things. Not that I would ever trade her. She IS Luna Lovegood.

I'm still amazed you found it. I legitimately spent an hour googling this morning before I stumbled on the sub and posted for help!
