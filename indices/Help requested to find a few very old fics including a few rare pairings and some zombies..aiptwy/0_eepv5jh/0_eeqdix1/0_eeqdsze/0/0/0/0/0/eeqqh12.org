I'm definitely going to spend some time here. I've recently gotten back into HP fanfic and its been great.

Totally agree on Luna. You're spot on.

On a final great fanfic note, if you haven't read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10672917/chapters/23626929][Debt of Time]] you should do so immediately. I'm sure it's a well known one but I found it about a month ago and it sucked me away from my other fandoms and right back into HP. I've been trapped in HP world ever since catching up after a several year hiatus into other in universes.
