I love Evanna and wouldn't trade her for anything, but I DO think her soft/sweet/spacey voice she used sort of made a lot of authors make her even more naive/ditzy/out of it that book-Luna ever actually was! Book-Luna is still a person, albeit a weird one with strange beliefs and a (outward) lack of care of what others think - she gets short with Hermione, offended when her dad or The Quibbler are attacked, etc. Movie-Luna just has a way of seeming so friendly and spacey that she doesn't even NOTICE things like that.

I spent roughly an hour-hour and a half looking, I think, and I almost gave up after finding that first livejournal that was a list of stories and mentioned Syn. In part, it was because I found LJ a bit annoying and clunky to navigate, lol! But I kept re-reading your summaries of the stories and it made them sound so interesting that I couldn't just leave it there.

Also, welcome to hpfanfiction, and stay awhile :) I've had more luck finding amazing stories on here than I've had looking on my own recently and there's a lot of really good character/plot dissections and discussions that pop up!
