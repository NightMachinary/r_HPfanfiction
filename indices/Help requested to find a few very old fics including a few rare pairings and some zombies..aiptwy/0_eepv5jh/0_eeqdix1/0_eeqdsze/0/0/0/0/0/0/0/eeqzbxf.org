If you prefer it, Debt of Time is actually also on ffn and can be read through their app. It is, however, censored for mature content, so more graphic parts are missing or have been rewritten for a lower rating. That won't impact your ability to fall in love with the plot though so. I actually read it on ffn first then went back to uncover missing scenes on ao3.

All of that said, I totally agree about the interface. I read on ao3 but rarely find new things there.
