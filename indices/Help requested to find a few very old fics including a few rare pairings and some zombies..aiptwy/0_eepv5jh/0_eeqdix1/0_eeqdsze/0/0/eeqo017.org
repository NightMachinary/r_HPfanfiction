That's actually how I found the Cicatrix story, by running across the one-shot first! I was opening and skimming all of the stuff to try and find the keywords, then saw that one was Luna/Percy and mentioned the Prophet - but then realized it wasn't the FULL story!

I love this Luna - in all of Syn's stories!
