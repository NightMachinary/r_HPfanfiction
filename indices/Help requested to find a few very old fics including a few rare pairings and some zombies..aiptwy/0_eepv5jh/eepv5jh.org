Hufflepuffs are particularly good finders ;)

+Think I [[https://audswritesfics.livejournal.com/1455.html][found a lead]]. Does 'audswritesfics' sound correct? It looks to me like that person isn't the author, but compiling a list of stories.+

+I'm not familiar with livejournal, but I finally tracked down #3 - however, the link to that one on their page just leads to a 'SinFree.Net' and won't load anything :/ The person who compiled the list says that 'Syn' is the author of 'The Company Ink', but there's no link to 'Syn's profile anywhere and I can't seem to find it, so I couldn't find anything similar to your #1 and #2 mentioned, sadly.+

+Hope this SOMEHOW can help even a little, even though I can't find an author page for Syn/'The Company Ink'. If you do find out, could you please let me know? They all sound really interesting and I'd love to read them!+

+Edit: I kept digging and think I found Syn's livejournal, now under [[https://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=cicatrixstories][Cicatrix]].+

+EDIT 2: HERE IS [[https://cicatrixstories.livejournal.com/30814.html]['The Company Ink']] ! Having trouble finding the other 2 because I can't easily get summaries for the others, but will keep on digging.+

+EDIT 3: [[https://cicatrixstories.livejournal.com/11851.html][Wake the Dead]] , your #1 story with zombies. Note, this is just the prologue, and livejournal doesn't seem to have a 'next chapter' button, but at least we have the title now!+

FINAL EDIT: Okay, I'm pretty sure I have all the chapters of all 3 stories found now. I also started to get the hang of the website - I made an account in order to get the fic summaries to display, but best I can tell there still is no (consistent/accurate) 'next chapter' function, so I just compiled all the chapters for all of the stories in my 'memories' tab (???), [[https://fairygodcat.livejournal.com/memories][here]], for anyone wanting to read them and not have to dig around to find the next bit. I saved them all as 'public', so they should be visible - let me know if they aren't. I'm not sure if you need an account to see the list or not.
