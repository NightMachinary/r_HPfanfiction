The Animagus-verse is a good example of what I'm looking for initially, yeah. That whole bit with Ms Wilkins and the placement process is what I'm wanting more of. I've read it before, unfortunately, but yeah. That's precisely what I'm looking for, so thanks for the rec!

Alternative Living Arrangements seems close-ish, but not quite. Implied processing, at least, is a step up from no processing at all. Read the first chapter and it was definitely fun, wholesome reading as you said - I enjoyed the slight "What the heck am I doing, feeding Potter's damn bird?" tone to Snape's last scene. :D

Phoenix Burns Brightest is definitely not - as far as I can tell, Dumbledore just takes the kid with no processing whatsoever. It is a good story, so thank you for the rec regardless. :)
