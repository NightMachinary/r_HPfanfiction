Oh i was forgetting, there is the "Animagus verse" series by White Squirrel, in which a five year old Harry escapes the abusive Dursleys accidentally turning into a kitten and ends up being adopted by the Grangers. Very interesting reading but I for myself lost interest once the story veered more toward politics (of the same author I find brilliant the interpretation they have for the subject of Arithmancy, well explored in their series "Arithmancer verse" but there the focus is on Hermione so it's completely off topic now)

The link to the animagus verse vvvv [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/977214]]
