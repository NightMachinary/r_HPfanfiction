Part one of the series Crow Rides A Pale Horse has what you're looking for, Harry grows up in a home for boys after being abandoned. The series is still WiP, and the world building and magic feel epic. I think there is also a part later that focuses on Lupin coming to the home and finding Harry. As the series progresses, there are bits about his childhood there, but the later parts have less of that.
