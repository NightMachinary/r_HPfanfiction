Processing and emotional outcomes? Then orphanages and primary schooling too? Damn. This is sounding more and more like the perfect example of a rec to this request. :)

And yep. Definitely sounds like something that'll engage me throughout - now I just need to read it and find out if they do those things in a way that's interesting and/or fun. They've got all the right content, I'm just hoping they execute it well. Either way, thanks again for a rec that nailed the request parameters. :)
