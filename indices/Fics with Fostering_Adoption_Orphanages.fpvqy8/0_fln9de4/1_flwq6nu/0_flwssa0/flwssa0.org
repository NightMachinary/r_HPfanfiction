There is an adoption ritual somewhere around chapter 20 for a boy that is adopted into the Nott family, that is at least somewhat explored, and then the adoption into the Slytherin Family happens in chapter 88, but there is a whole bunch of pre-adoption talks etc in the chapters before and afterwards some visits from the Wizarding Child Services (or whatever they are called).

Also Harrys adoption is very fast, but the author tries to also deal with the fall out of Harry basically having no choice in the whole thing. Which would be the beginning of the story.

Edit: They also in general explore the setting of an orphange and a primary school etc and how those are run, so maybe the whole story will be a bit more engaging as a whole besides you just waiting for the adoption parts to start :)
