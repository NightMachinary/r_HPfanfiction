Yeah, they do and it's really quite sad sometimes - it can make for some really interesting, character-driven moments when prospective-parents and prospective-child meet, or when the prospective-parents talk to adoption staff about why they want to adopt, etc. Sort of a mix of Meet the Robinsons (the Disney Movie) and Instant Family (the Wahlburg Movie).

Thanks for the rec. Do you know when the second kid gets adopted? General ballpark, I mean - it's rather a lot to read through at just-under 900K words and I'd like to know vaguely when it'll get to what I want to read. :)
