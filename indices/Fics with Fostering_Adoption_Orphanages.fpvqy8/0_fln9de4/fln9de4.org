There would be linkffn(11540013), where Harry gets adopted by Voldemort and while the procedure for him is quite fast etc they get to adopt another kid later on and the procedures have been changed around at that point so there is a lot more to it then.

There are some other fics, but I think most skip over the actual real adoption process, and just have the characters sign some papers and bam now they are magically your new guardian blabla.
