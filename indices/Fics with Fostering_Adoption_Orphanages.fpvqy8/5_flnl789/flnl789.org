That I know of, there are fics where Harry is adopted by: Sirius(with people not knowing of his innocence), Jiraya (naruto), Vampires, The Rock and some random police officer who lives down the street.

Of these, the naruto one is an op harry, the Sirius one is alright, the vampires one is somewhat of a castlevania crossover and is kinda gory, the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7583739/1/][Rock]] one is crack and the Police one is funny.

I'll post the rest of the links if I can find them again
