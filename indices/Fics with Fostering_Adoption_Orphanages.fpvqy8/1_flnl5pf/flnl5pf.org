This is a big chunk of the initial sections of linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom), where Harry is taken from the Dursleys and placed in a 're-education' orphanage for muggleborns. It makes sense in context.

Harry is also raised in a muggle orphanage in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome), and is in conflict over leaving his former childhood friends behind for much of the story.
