If you don't mind crossovers, there's a crossover with the Avengers series titled "Fates Be Changed" where Bruce Banner adopts Harry. I loved this story because the author explores how the two met and how they slowly adjusted to one another. In fact, they didn't even get to Hogwarts until many chapters later. linkffn(11397437)
