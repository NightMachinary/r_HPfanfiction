Less dark are these:

- it is not the main focus of the plotline, but in linkao3(Inner Demons by serendipity_50) (highly recommended!) Harry post-war is the patron of an orphanage for the war orphans, and it is very relevant for the story.

- in linkffn(3912184;4236594) Daphne Greengrass (very different from your stereotypical Haphne, and IMHO the best one out there) is an orphan, living (outside of Hogwarts) with her foster mother, who is a squib.
