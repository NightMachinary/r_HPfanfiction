Neither of them have any entrance processing: in the first one, the actual orphans are just already living in the orphanage sponsored by Harry, in the Daphne ones the story is in her sixth and seventh years, so the orphanage (or actually the foster mother) is mostly in her memories. There is one scene, where she leaves that home because her foster Mum (being a squib) runs away to France, because Voldemort would not be kind to her, and Daphne is for few months before she is seventeen taken over by Weasleys, and then the paperwork is mostly “Albus made the paperwork go away”.
