This is wonderful! Well done again.

The discrepancies between the top words in fanfic and canon is fascinating. Canon has a lot more focus on characters positive to Harry, like Hagrid and McGonagall, or on neutral mundane things, like wand and robes. I think endeavours like this help us learn a lot about how we think of the series and what we do with it.

If you do decide to do this again in future, it might also be interesting to analyse characters separately to the rest of words. That might also help us see what characters get attention, and also what subjects. I found the fact that Remus Lupin, Snape, Sirius and Draco all getting way more interest in fandom than canon text interesting.

It reminds me of my recent reread - I couldn't believe how much Hagrid and Peeves there was in the books, as they almost disappear in fanfics.

Thanks again ðŸ˜Š
