As mentioned in the foreword, it's based primarily on the game universe, so you should be fine. Ideally you'll want to be familiar with generation 4, FireRed and LeafGreen, rather than generation 1, and it doesn't hurt to have some familiarity with other generations just so you know more about geography. But I haven't played anything beyond generation 2, and it hasn't been a big problem.
