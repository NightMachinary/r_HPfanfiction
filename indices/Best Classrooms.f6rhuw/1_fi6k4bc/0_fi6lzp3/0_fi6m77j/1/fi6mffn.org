Oooh, okay. I've been getting into pokemon fanfiction here and there recently, actually. There's a story called 'A smell of petroleum pervades throughout' that was frickin' excellent. Blended Lovecraft and Pokemon incredibly well.

Do I need to know the cartoons stuff, or is just playing the games enough to read the story?
