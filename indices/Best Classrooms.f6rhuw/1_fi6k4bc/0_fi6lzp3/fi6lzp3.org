Ah, sorry. It's not the moral stuff I'm looking for, just the classroom scenes. Basically, any time characters are learning stuff in a classroom - the moral philosophy stuff from Starship Troopers was just what motivated the request.

MoR definitely does do philosophy... not spectacularly well, but pretty well for HP fanfiction. I haven't read the whole thing because it's a lot to read when it stars a character I utterly abhor, but I'll take another look and poke around for some of the philosophy stuff too.
