They're not necessarily in classrooms, but there are quite a few such philosophical debates between characters in Methods of Rationality. Some readers like them, others consider them deadweight. Personally, I find them thought-provoking.

Chapter 87 has quite a good one, where Harry and Hermione disagree about whether Draco Malfoy is inherently and irredeemably evil, or whether that is more properly attributed to his upbringing. And there's an ongoing disagreement between Harry and Professor Dumbledore about taking a hard line vs picking your battles and compromising.
