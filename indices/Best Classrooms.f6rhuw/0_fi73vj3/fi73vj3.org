I know some that are at least noteworthy:

- linkffn(Victoria Potter): there are a lot of good things about this fic, but as per your request there is a lot of nuance and subtext that comes in the classrooms, both for understanding the "mechanics" of HP magic and the wider wizarding world/culture/history. Highly recommend.
- linkffn(Forging the Sword): focuses heavily on Harry, Ron and Hermione's interactions both in and out of the class, and what that can tell you about the world.
- linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): there is a /lot/ in this fic I realize, but many of the class scenes (such as the pagan religion classes) are fairly memorable in the ramifications and world-building. Mostly its about Harry, Snape and Voldemort's interactions overall, each of whom are personally standouts in the fandom.
- linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff): mostly its Harry trying to find the minimal effort he can make to do anything, while everyone else tries to theorize/rationalize the how and why he wants to do what he does. Has some hilarious innovations at points.
- linkffn(The Changeling): arguably one of the best "if-X-character-was-in-Slytherin" fics, most of the story focuses on the subtext and character interaction that often occurs between Ginny and others, both in and out-of the classroom. There is an especially relevant section in Year 6 (or Deathly Hallows in this storyline), where Ginny is learning from Snape.

There are more, but its somewhat dependent upon what you think personally about each individual scene rather than as a whole. I think you may have trouble finding good moral philosophizing like in ST as the Hogwarts students are pre-teens and teenagers rather than young adults regularly interacting with the outside world. You might try something like On the Way to Greatness though if you want some discussions about that.
