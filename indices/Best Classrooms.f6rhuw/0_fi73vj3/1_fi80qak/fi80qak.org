I really need to stop writing so much in these things. Apparently I'm just not good at getting my points across well - it's not about the moral philosophy. The whole thing about Starship Troopers was just what motivated the request. All I was looking for was good classroom scenes where people learn stuff that's relevant to the world or plot. For Starship Troopers, that was moral philosophy, like you said for Victoria Potter, that's mechanics and the wizarding worldbuilding. Not like canon, where he just learns spells that he uses later (mystery solving format), but like fleshing out and exploring details about the world and plot.
