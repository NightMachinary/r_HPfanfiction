I really, really hope that the point of this fic will be to show how absolutely atrocious the ministry decree is. Besides being a complete invalidation of what is generally considered human rights (literal thought crime? What exact definition of "Sympathetic" is it using) it's also a complete atrocity against the rule of law (Innocent until proven guilty, you don't have to prove you're innocent in court, the opposition has to prove you're guilty).

Gonna keep reading for now, but I will so disappointed if the moral lesson at the end isn't : This law is a complete atrocity against humanity.
