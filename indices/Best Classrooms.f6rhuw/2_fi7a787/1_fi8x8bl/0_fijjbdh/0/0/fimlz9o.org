Heh. Fair enough. It is definitely difficult to sympathise with a character doing things like that. I guess it's intended for a similar audience that Game of Thrones, Blacklist, Breaking Bad, and Boardwalk Empire and such are intended for. The kind of people who like Moriarty from Sherlock and The Joker from Batman. I think it's more interesting to me because of that flagrant immorality. The road to hell is paved with good intentions and all that. Well-meaning people really can do the most terrible things.
