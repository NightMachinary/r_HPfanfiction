  guess it's intended for a similar audience that Game of Thrones, Blacklist, Breaking Bad, and Boardwalk Empire and such

Eh, I liked all those shows except Blacklist. I'm not sure I worded my thoughts correctly. Its less that "oh, evil protagonist, I hate it" for me, its that the story presents their actions as a moral good. Breaking Bad never pretended Walt making meth and murdering people was right. Game of Thrones had the Lannisters as objectively villainous as possible, yet still be the focus of the show in certain ways. They never pretended they were righteous. Either the characters in the show (Hank Schrader) or the meta narrative itself pretty much objectively spelled out "This is immoral". I found none of that in this fic. To me it reads like the author noticed no moral qualms about this law. To me all the good characters talking it up as a good thing threw me off. The dissonance was what made me dislike it.
