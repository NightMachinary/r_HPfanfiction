Yes. unless that turns out to be the twist later on, that's exactly correct.

edit: just to be 100% clear, I dont have an issue of virtuous characters being bad sometimes, as long as the narrative acknowledges it. or villainous characters pretending to be good in universe, so long as the author doesnt write them as genuinely good, without explaining why their villainous actions are good.
