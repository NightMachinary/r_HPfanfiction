Okay, yeah. That does make sense. Thank you for the additional clarification - I very much agree with you now I understand your points. :)

It's about narrative meta-honesty. Villains having some angelic tendencies is fine and a villain pretending to be an ally is fine, but claiming their villainy is angelic is a bit too much. Like claiming The Party in Orwell were the good guys doing good things.
