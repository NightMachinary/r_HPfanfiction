It isn't that it's outside the realm of possibility ; It's that the "heroes" of the story seem to act and think that this is a good thing, a just thing. I dropped the fic about 7 chapters in. I couldn't keep reading a story where I'm clearly expected to sympathize with the temperate, enduring, saint Hermione for not sending people to Azkaban for wrongthink.
