I mean, neither of those things are demonstrated in the Harry Potter world and many things are demonstrated that strongly imply neither of those things exist there - The Ministry basically owns the one media source, the Minister is apparently able to act as Prosecutor in criminal trials, Muggleborns, the apparent motto of the Wizengamot is 'ignorance of the law is no excuse', Dementors, right to a fair trial, right to life, presumption of innocence (Listen to how Fudge talks in Harry's trial, he almost entirely talks like Harry is already guilty), etc etc. I agree that it's hopefully shown, but I think it'd be perfectly in-line with canon if it wasn't.
