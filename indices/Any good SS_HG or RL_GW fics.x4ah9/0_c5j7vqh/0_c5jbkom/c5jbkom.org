YES SO HARD. Here's some more, because I read SSHG far too much.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7454117/1/][Just To Be*]]: Snape, Hermione, and Harry work to make sure the orphans of Death Eaters can have a good life. Depressing at times, but SO in character, and absolutely amazing!

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2290003/1/][Pet Project]]: One of the longest-running classic SSHG fics. Not finished, dammit, but really good.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3733492/1/][The Apprentice and the Necromancer]]: Another classic. Marriage law fic from back when marriage law fics were something new and cool.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2162474/1/][When A Lionness Fights*]]: This is tied with Just To Be for the place of my favourite SSHG fics. Basically, Hermione takes over Snape's job as the spy in the Death Eater camp. If you accept that Hermione would do that in the first place... It's really in character. And also amazing. And also a bit dark at times, as SSHG tends to be.
