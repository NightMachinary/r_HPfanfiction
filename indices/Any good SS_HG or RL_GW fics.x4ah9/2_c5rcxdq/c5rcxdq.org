Go to Petulant Poetess and look up "Potions Under Duress" for HGSS wonderfulness. They are my top selection for stories since OWL shut down. Here is my "short" list of stories from there that are excellent and 40k+ words in length. Most are more mature ratings. I wrote the list for someone and copy/pasted it here.

Princess of Gryffindor - BEST HGSS OF ALL TIME. (imho)

Heart with No Companion - Biggest Tearjerker.

A Change is Going to Come - Also called "Vanity" in a couple places, a time travel fic that is pretty good if you are ok with time travel fanfic logic.

Being Hermione Granger - I just remember liking it, not too much more about the plot though. Standard romance I think...

Care of Magical Creatures - Romance adventure, Marriage Law Challenge. I really like MLC and this one didn't disappoint.

Flight of the Prince - I know I liked it, I think it's an adventure romance, but I don't remember plot details.

For Hogwarts: A Regency Gamble - This one was adorable. It reads like a Jane Austen novel. How to raise money for Hogwarts in the aftermath of the war? Have a historical theme week at the castle. Totally AU, but adorable.

Hilltop Cottage - Very cute romance.

Improbable Felicity - Another cute romance.

Phantom of Hogwarts - Hogwarts makes a production of "The Phantom of the Opera". Fabulous story. I also think it is the longest SSHG story in the fandom.

Phoenix Song and Phoenix Tears - Gradual romance, shows the behind the scenes of HBP and DH from Hermione's viewpoint.

Raven - The name sounds awful, but it's a good story! Gradual romance and had a few plot points that you don't see everywhere.

Sage - 30 years later and compliant with the epilogue while also coming across as plausible!

Southern Magic- Neat plot ideas. Totally AU. The story itself is maybe a "B", but it's different and is a nice contrast to traditional stories.

Spinster - Eventually a romance, good traditional plot. Some very funny scenarios.

The Godfather - Achingly beautiful. Just read it if you haven't already.

The Love You Take - Lovely romance.
