Well, linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) is a Severus-redoes-his-life story, so it's Snily, and he's working to bring the war to a shorter close. But James is present and (mostly, eventually) a sympathetic character, and it does depict how the conflict outside the walls of Hogwarts makes it feel a bit like a siege.
