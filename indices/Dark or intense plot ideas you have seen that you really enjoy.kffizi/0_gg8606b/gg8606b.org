[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26917306][Our Minds Work in Mysterious Ways (But We Like It Like That) by InsomniacAndBi]] by InsomniacAndBi is my favorite psychological thriller. It's painful, messed up, and beautiful.

Edit: There is no rape, but there are a lot of murders. I'm not sure if that counts as too much...
