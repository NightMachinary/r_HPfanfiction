That's canon. In the introduction to /Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them/, there's a mention of a dragon that got loose from a reserve in Britain and attacked a seaside town. Thanks to the quick actions of several families of wizards who were on vacation there, no one died. The families were awarded Orders of Merlin, First Class for their efforts at preserving the Statute of Secrecy. The Oblivators took care of most of the witnesses, but they missed a guy. To this day, he drinks heavily and tells anyone who comes near him about the "great bloody lizards in the sky, breathing fire."

The Oblivators did not go back to wipe his memory because it doesn't matter. No one believes him, and some wizards think it's funny.

So this is canon. Oblivators do not do a perfect job. There are people they miss. These people then canonically become conspiracy theorists or what most of us consider to be crazies. In reality, they're telling the truth. No efforts are made to patch up these holes in the Statute because nobody believes those people, and because wizards seem to think it's funny when a muggle ruins their life trying to tell the truth and get people to believe them.

So this is explicitly real.
