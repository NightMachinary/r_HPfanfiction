I'm picturing a Bewitched type scenario where Martin Miggs is a bit like Agnes Cravits (always trying to get Abner to look when the neighbors are performing magic, but they suddenly stops whenever he looks) but leaves the house more and goes on all sorts of adventures that have him colliding with magic all while he's desperately trying to expose the conspiracy of magic, but even his conspiracy circle friends think he's a hit out there.
