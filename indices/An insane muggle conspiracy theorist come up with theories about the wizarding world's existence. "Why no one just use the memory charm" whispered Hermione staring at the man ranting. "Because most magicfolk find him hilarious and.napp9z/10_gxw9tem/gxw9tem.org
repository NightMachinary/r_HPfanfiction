There was a crossover with Harry in Japan where this was explicitly a thing.

All the 'bad special effects' Sentai shows and live action magical girl shows that crop up? Actually partially funded by the magicals so if film pops up, they can doctor it to look just a little more fake and people think it's just cosplay or done for press or art.
