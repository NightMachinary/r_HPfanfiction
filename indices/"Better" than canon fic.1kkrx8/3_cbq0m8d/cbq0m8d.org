Have you read The-Caitliff's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3022004/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Freak-Parade][Harry Potter and the Freak Parade]]? It's a bit crackish, though it does feature a wiser, time-traveling Harry and Luna who manage to save everyone (and annoy them).

  Starts as parody of the formula most independant!Harry stories follow. Overly friendly Goblins, Manipulative Dumbledore, a shopping trip, a will from Sirius etc... Then it gets weird.
