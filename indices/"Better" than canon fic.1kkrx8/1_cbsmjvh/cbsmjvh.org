So I just recommended this one in another thread but it's so good i'll mention it again. Try Lightning on the Wave's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Sacrifices Arc]], you will not regret it.

Also, a good time travel fic would be May Marlow's [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/284278/chapters/453146][If Them's the Rules]], which focuses on Harry going back in time to raise a more humane Tom Riddle and avoid all the atrocities that he commits. May Marlow is slow on updates but always worth the read. Her other fic [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/294722/chapters/471501][The Train to Nowhere]], an AU take on where Harry would be if he had been raised by his parents and grown up in a Voldemort-led wizarding Britain, is also really good.
