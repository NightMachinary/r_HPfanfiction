[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment]] - just a really good fic. Harry doesn't lead a resistance per se (unless you define a resistance as two people), but he does fight and kill Grindelwald.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12177140/1/Phoenix-Corrupted]] - Harry is gearing up to fight against Grindelwald but the fic ends before the conflict before Grindelwald comes into play.
