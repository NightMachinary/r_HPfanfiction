I felt the same way at first, but as explained in [[/u/grace644]]'s post, there are reasons for why people are acting the way they are. I originally only read a couple chapters of Saving Connor before giving up on it. I was convinced to give it another shot and it's good. Don't expect the characters to ever come back to how they were in the originals, though. This is very AU, and even though you learn why things are the way they are, that upbringing shapes Harry into a very different person.
