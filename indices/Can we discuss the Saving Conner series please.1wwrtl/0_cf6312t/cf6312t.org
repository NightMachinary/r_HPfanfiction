SPOILERS!!!

Okay, so you obviously have not gotten past the second book in the series, which for your reasoning I understand. BUT after that second book, Draco and Snape both realize that Harry was abused. That he had been brainwashed, that his magic had also been confined, and that they now had to deal with a child that was not only abused, but magically gifted. NOT to mention a child whose mind had been warped into a soldiers' from an early age. As the books progress we slowly learn what the "training" was that Harry had to under go and Snape eventually decides to bring the Potters and Dumbledor to trial. AND he gains custody over Harry. Draco and Snape then have try to heal the damage done to him.

I have a degree in Human and Family Development and I was really taken aback with how well the author was in showing how certain aspects of the abuse morphed Harry's mind. It was very accurate.

What I also liked about the series was that as the books progressed other things about the magical world was talked about. How houseelves were enslaved, what would have to be done in order to eliminate inequalities in the wizarding world in a peaceful manner etc. They even went into details on werewolves. The series takes off incredibly by the fourth book (not counting the small story maze of light). I want to tell you more, but I already gave you a lot of spoilers. I know someone that felt the exact same way you did, and when I got him to push through and read the books he ended up loving them. So I am telling you now push through ;)

EDIT: Also I should mention that Harry is very much in denial about the abuse.
