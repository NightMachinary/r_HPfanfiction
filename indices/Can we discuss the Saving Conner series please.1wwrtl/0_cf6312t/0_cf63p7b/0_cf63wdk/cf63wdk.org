What I really liked about this series, is that in the first two books you see Harry's mind and exactly how messed up it truly is. You as a reader get frustrated, and it allows you to identify more with Draco and Snape in this frustration. Which trust me both Draco and Snape realize that they way Harry is thinking is warped, but they don't know yet why. So there is this long process of them finding out. In the first book as it progresses though, Harry begins to see some holes in his training. He starts to want things. Like a friendship with Draco, and he begins to feel guilty as he begins pursuing that friendship. More stuff does happen in the first and second book. There is more development, trust me.
