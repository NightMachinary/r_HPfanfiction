I never said the ones before were bad. I enjoyed the second book, because Harry's whole life perspective was beginning to be change. I liked seeing how he coped with learning that his brother was not infallible, that what his mother did was not moral, and seeing him choose Draco over his brother a few times. Completely going against his training. It was to me the beginning of something new.

The third book I enjoyed, because it was when his mind was starting to be put back together after it was shattered. (You have to read the ending of the second book to know how that happened) Draco and him became closer, and Snape started becoming involved with him in a more guardian like manner.

There were things that happened in the other books that grip at your attention.

BUT 4th books is when it just takes off. It's more action packed, there is more adult content, more philosophical questioning, more alliances, more Drarry, more things other than Voldermort that Harry faces, and we get to see more Slytherin characters in a flattering light. The whole story begins to really show the other side's trial over the war.
