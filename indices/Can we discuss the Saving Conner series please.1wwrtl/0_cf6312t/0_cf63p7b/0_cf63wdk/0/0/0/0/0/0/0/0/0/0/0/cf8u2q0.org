  I feel that this series was interesting from the start.

Obviously many people, like the OP disagree.

  So before giving it a chance to see where it goes, they deem it un-interesting, solely based on their perception of other fanfics

Yes. I'll give a fic a few chapters to try and entertain me and when it can't do that, I drop it. That's the way I, and many many other people try to wade through the "90% is shit"-rule. You can't seriously expect people to read over 3 million words of a fic before they make up their mind??

If the start doesn't work for me, I won't continue. I really don't care if things make sense in context when that context won't show up for another three books. That's not how good storytelling works.
