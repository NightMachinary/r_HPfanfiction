My whole point was, I saw it as interesting from the start because I did not have other bad fics clouding my judgment on it. It looked like OP disliked it after a few chapters because they had this impression of what the story was going to be about. I was trying to convey that if others did not have the stereotypical bad fics in their head, they may find this one more interesting. Give it more of a chance, before dismissing it as another mary sue Harry fic or something.

I am not saying that you should read this. I have not once advised you to read this fic, because you do not like slash. I am advising people who have stopped reading this fic based on reasons such as judging it by other fics to read it.

I do still feel that three chapters is not a good place to stop reading, but if you want to stop reading books after the first three chapters that is your business, I'm merrily pointing out that by doing so there is the chance that you will miss out on good work. OP wanted to know why this was a big deal to people, so I pointed out why and suggested to OP that based on the reasons they describe they continue reading.

Also, considering you do not like slash and have no intention of reading this why are you on this at all?
