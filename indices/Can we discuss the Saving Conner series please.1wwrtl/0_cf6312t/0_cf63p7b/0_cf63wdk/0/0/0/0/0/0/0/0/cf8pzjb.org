I disagree with the three chapter rule and to some extent with the notion of a book needing to capture the audiences attention immediately. Some would argue that the Harry Potter series started out slow with the first book's chapter. All of Jane Austen's books were exceptionally slow at the beginning, and some even past the middle. The Lord of the Rings was slow to start, and was also filled with slow chapters, but all of these books are considered amazing literature. The three chapter rule, could take away a multitude of amazing stories.
