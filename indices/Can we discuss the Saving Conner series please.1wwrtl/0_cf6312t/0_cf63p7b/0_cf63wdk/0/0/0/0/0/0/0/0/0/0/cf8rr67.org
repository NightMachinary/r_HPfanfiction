I feel that this series was interesting from the start. I think that people who have been let down with other fanfics begin reading it and think it is going to have the same flaws like the other ones. So they dismiss it the idea right away.They think it's another super powered Harry, where he can just wave his wand and do anything. Or that it's this super Mary sue Harry with no flaws, when in reality he is the most flawed character in this. So before giving it a chance to see where it goes, they deem it un- interesting, solely based on their perception of other fanfics. Look at the things OP listed as their major faults with the series. Each one is addressed in the story, and it was not at all what OP thought it would turn out to be. The series has thousands of followers and reviews... It's interesting. I have only had one person that I asked to re-read it dislike it at the end. All the others have loved it, and even deemed it one of their favorites.
