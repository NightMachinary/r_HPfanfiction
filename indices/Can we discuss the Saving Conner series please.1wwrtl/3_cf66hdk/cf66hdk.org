I agree. I see this fic recced in almost every thread, but I can't stand it. Like you said, everyone is ridiculously ooc, and the interactions make me cringe with just how forced they seem.

Also I don't like stories with Harry's parents where they intentionally mistreat him. Or slash. Or wrong BWL stories. Basically, Saving Connor is just not for me on way too many levels
