Going in a different direction, what I loved about this series and what made me reread it (I rarely reread stories) is how fleshed out the magic in this story really is. Things that JK pretty much hand waved and even terms that are used as if we should already know what they mean are given really deep, well thought explanations that drew me into the world more than familiar characters and story lines ever have.

I would almost suggest that, when you read it, you forget that it is HPFF. In terms of character relationships, the changes to this AU are so drastic as to make the cannon side almost irrelevant. As for the more specific complaints you made. Lily is a sycophant for Dumbledore just as much as Bellatrix is for Voldemort, James is a wet noodle wrapped around Lily's finger, and Harry is a nearly textbook child soldier who has never known another way of life.
