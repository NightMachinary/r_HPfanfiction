I managed to read half of the first one. This is taking the selfless hero idea to a mockery of an extreme. I won't go into the OoC characterizations, that is a writer's prerogative, and you can make a case as to why it's that way (Snape doesn't cling to Lily because she didn't die, Dumbledore was always kind of a bastard, the Marauders may have not really matured, etc)... but Harry as the lead is just cringeworthy.

He's completely selfless, super-powered, both brave and cunning, loving, the best flyer, fighter, and whatever in the world. His entire way of thought two-dimensional, his interactions with other characters dull, and most unforgivably, he is uninteresting. This is either building up to a complete Mary Sue, an immature angstfest, or both. In any case, it was enough to make me stop reading it.
