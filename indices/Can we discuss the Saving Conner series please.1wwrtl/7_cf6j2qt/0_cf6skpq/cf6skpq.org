Hey, I'm not going to say you should read through the series or anything, but if you had gotten past the first books you see that Harry was extremely flawed.

He wasn't loving, that is one of the major issues he faces when he realizes that he had been brainwashed into being this perfect child protector. He starts to wonder if he loves his brother at all, or is just too tied into his duty to him. He has major intimacy issues, which hurt his relationship with everyone around him. He was so used to being so secretive, and everything never being about him that he couldn't talk to others and couldn't think of himself. Then as the story progresses, physical intimacy becomes a subject and he can't even bare to be touched. He shys away from pleasure, because Lilly had trained him too.

He also is too self-sacrificing because of how he was raised. He doesn't even think of himself as a person. Which is another thing he has to struggle through. It also is one of the reasons he thinks so two-dimensional, when he begins to accept more of what happened to him he starts thinking in different ways.

Too sum it all up, as the books progress Harry is basically the extremely messed up one. Everyone sees it, but he maintains denial for the longest time about it.
