I read it till about the 4 book I think (it's bean a while) but in the end I had two major problems with it. First, how very much mary-sue Harry was starting to be and second how ooC not just a few but /all/ the characters were. I liked it at first for the interactions between Harry, Draco and Snape but at some point I just couldn't take the ridiculousness anymore.
