I'm going to say from the start that I haven't read the Sacrifices Arc in 7+ years, so my memory is fuzzy at best about it. What I /can/ say though is that part of the hype is about the sheer length (even if I didn't like the series, I have to respect the dedication to write /three million words/ of fanfiction) and the speed at which they were released. Back when the series was actively updated, you could expect a five to ten thousand word chapter released daily.

That was a huge part of the hype back in the day.
