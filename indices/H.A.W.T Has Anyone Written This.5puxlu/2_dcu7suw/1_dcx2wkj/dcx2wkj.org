I would love to see more stories about Lockhart in general. Like one where he is almost as great as he stay, completely full of himself, arrogant, and sometimes afraid, but truly talented, adventurous, and good at teaching students.

Sort of a mix between a magical Indiana Jones, and Hercule from Dragon Ball Z.
