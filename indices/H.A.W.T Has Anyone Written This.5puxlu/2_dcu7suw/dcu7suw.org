Lockhart fell into a giant cauldron of Felix Felicis as a toddler, which has left him kind of insane, but also incredibly lucky. He stumbles his way from one improbable success to the next and finds himself as Harry's mentor at Hogwarts. Because his luck makes him so competent at stuff, it takes Harry a while to figure out that Lockhart has no idea what he's doing most of the time.
