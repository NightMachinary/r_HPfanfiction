I have two ideas that I plan to eventually do snippets of, but I'll post them here for now...

--------------

Number 1: Harry dies. Met by Osiris (what? Do you think that after dealing with Death Eaters he'd want a Grim Reaper with a skull mask and black robes too?) in the underworld, he's informed of the true nature of Horcruxes; they don't merely allow their possessor to defy death, but to defy fate itself, manipulating fortune and granting their wielder power enough to subvert logic and destiny. Therefore, Voldemort is unbeatable with sheer power, wisdom, or luck, he can only be destroyed through exploiting the dark lord's own flaws.

With that in mind, Osiris offers to send Harry back to try again (typical Peggy Sue, you know); though he can't keep his knowledge of the Horcruxes or advanced magic (after all, divine intervention would only let Voldemort get stronger too), he can give Harry a small present, like an idea or minor talent or just a few memories, just enough to maybe, let Harry win this time...

This'd be a subversion of the usual trend of 'Time travelling Harry comes back with knowledge of Horcruxes and super magic and his Gringotts vaults and uses them to whoop butt' by having the Horcruxes be different, a mechanism by which Voldemort literally gets stronger to defeat anything that stands in his way right up to and including gods.

Number 2: The real reason that house-elves are slaves comes out; while doing research into their origins, Hermione (who else?) learns that the elves willingly gave themselves into slavery and poverty in order to save wizarding humans at a time when lack of resources, plague and violence was threatening to wipe them all out.

However, the price was that when wizards and witches were safely in the black again, that their elves would be freed and wizardkind would help them in turn to become prosperous (a brand new island isn't out of the question); however, the witches and wizards haven't been keeping this agreement and have kept elvenkind as slaves long past their contracted date.

So...what happens when the house-elves learn of this? Why it was proper for them to be slaves, but is the opposite of proper now? The answer is of course 'whatever makes the best story'.
