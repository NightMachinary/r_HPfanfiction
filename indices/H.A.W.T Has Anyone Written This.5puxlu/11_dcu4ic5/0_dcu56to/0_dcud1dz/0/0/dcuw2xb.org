Hmm...I remember reading a story once that had a wrong-Boy-who-Lived plot, and something about a king of serpents; it was unusual in that it had a 'travel back in time to try again' thing happen at the end, with the twist that Harry would keep a randomized half of his memories, but the other half would go to Voldemort.

Sadly, I don't know if the sequel was ever completed...but yeah, it'd be possible to have a time-travel plot without the accompanying memories/advanced power/etc.

Heck, maybe make it that after Harry's sent back in time, the only thing he remembers is that there's things he's forgotten...on second thoughts, nevermind, that'd only serve to brew up a 'canon except Harry is more studious and competent' situation, which isn't all that fascinating.
