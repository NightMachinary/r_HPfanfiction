Not really. A couple of thousand years, a few invasions and dynasty changes and the combination of no further contact with the old foe and convenient and willing to please servants that do not exhibit suspicious behaviour and we go from living memory to oral history to faery tales from a dead culture to a forgotten past.

Nothing stupid about it, merely normal human minds and time.
