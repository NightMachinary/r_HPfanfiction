How many Babylonian songs do you remember? How many Etruscan legends? Have you been told the stories the Harappan Civilization used to tell or the people of Elam? The event may have had world-wide importance but it certainly wasn't an occasion of world-wide activity.

The Ilias had the advantage that it was an important work of a civilization and culture which never died, which /survived/ from the time of the epos' creation until today. The civilization that "created" the house elves did not survive. The Epic of Gilgamesh was /lost/ for millennia and was only incompletely recovered.

So yes, you WILL forget, you will forget where the fragments that may somehow survive come from and how they fit together. You may remember that it is acceptable and important to punish your house elf gratuitously and viciously and as often as possible even though the fact that this practice is merely a remnant of humans mimicking the dynamics of the demon hordes and gleefully taking it up as it sated their thirst for revenge.

Even the Wizarding World is not a world of chroniclers and historiographers. It is a world of peasants and powermongers who as quickly dismiss history and legends they deem unimportant to them as they focus on those bits that aid their own narrative. Maybe some birch bark manuscript or clay tablet telling of the original events survived buried somewhere but it certainly won't be commonly known or easy to find.
