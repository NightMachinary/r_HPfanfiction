You buy cultists over things that parallel the real-world flow of history? Oh boy!

We are talking about a time without instantaneous world-wide travel or communication. We are talking about a time without universal literacy, even and especially amongst wizards. We are talking about lost cultures and languages that didn't survive much past the folks that bore them. We are talking about history lost and distorted in bits and pieces until it became unrecognisable. We are talking Ozymandias - "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"

We are not talking about Wizarding England, But In Black-and-White.
