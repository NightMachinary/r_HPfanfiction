Given how important this was, I assume we're not talking about a single civilisation, but a world-wide effort. If it was a single civilisation, well, then there is really no problem - if a bunch of primitive wizards from the dawn of time could have stopped it, then it probably won't take anything more than a class of Hogwarts's 7th years to do the same, given how much progress magic made since then. So, yeah, let the imps call their master. If Hagrid doesn't tame the monsters, they can serve as target practise for DADA, or the DoM will gather them for further study.

Unless of course you subscribe to the view that present wizards are a pale shadow of their ancestors, and not only forget about the house elves' origins, but also didn't manage to make any progress in magic.

I personally think that the result of another invasion by demons should be like an invasion by the Sea People of modern Britain - quickly and easily dealt with using modern technology.
