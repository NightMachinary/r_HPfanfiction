We're talking about an event so important, it would have been mentioned in legends and song. An event of true world-wide importance. Such an event would not be forgotten. It would likely be the wizarding world's Ilias, or the saga of Gilgamesh. And the kernel of truth would have been preserved. You really don't forget about a race of evil demons turned into slaves. Not when you have magic to ensure that such a thing will not be forgotten.
