Alternative Number 2: The house elves are bound imps, minor demons that once were the foot soldiers of an invading demonic army. Wizards back then found a way to break their masters' hold over them by forcing their own bonds onto the creatures and enslaving them. That allowed them ultimately to repel the invasion.

Whenever a house elf is freed, when the wizards' bond on them is broken, they return to the command of their old masters. Not much of a problem while the numbers of free elves are low. The seals on the walls between the dimensions are strong enough and the hellish rulers have their own concerns, they don't watch Earth like hawks, waiting for the slightest weakness to once again try for an incursion. But recently Hermione's work has started to pay dividends and the numbers of free elves have been rising. Rising enough that their combined prayers call out loud enough across the dimensions to be received by perceptive ears.

And wizardkind has forgotten much, maybe too much.
