Helga Hufflepuff's animagus was a honey badger, and though short, she was the strongest magical barbarian/warrior of her time, overpowering the other founders.

Merope Gaunt is part of an offshoot branch of the House of Hufflepuff that, over the last millennium, has forgotten that they were part of Hufflepuff and somehow firmly rooted themselves in the idea of being of the Slytherin line. This is because Hufflepuff was, incidentally, also a Parselmouth as a honey badger, and this was somehow passed on. The official line doesn't correct them, because they've long since died out.

Tom Riddle still gets sorted into Slytherin due to his upbringing, but when he finds the chamber and meets the basilisk, he begins to ask interesting questions -- questions like "why does the basilisk not respect me?", "the basilisk is looking at me, should I be worried?", "why am I immune to basilisk venom?", and "why is the basilisk cowering away from me?"
