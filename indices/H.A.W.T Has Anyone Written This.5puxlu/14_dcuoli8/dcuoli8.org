This is an old bunny I once posted on the Harry Potter Fanfiction Challenges forum on ff.net. I've never seen one that was completed or close to complete. I'm thinking of doing it myself if I ever have the time.

I do not have the time.

/Harry Potter: Animal Whisperer/

#+begin_quote
  Ever since Harry was young, he always had a way with animals. Every animal he's met (even Ripper and Mrs Figg's cats!) before Hogwarts has always liked him and he's gotten along well with them. He also has a few special talents: He can understand and communicate with any animal, can enable animals to speak in human tongue and on occasion, can take on the abilities of an animal (such as the grace of a cat and the ability to swing from trees like monkeys). How will his animal based powers affect his time at Hogwarts and his battles against Voldemort and his forces?

I can see why someone might see that as overpowered, but I thought it would have been a fun read.
