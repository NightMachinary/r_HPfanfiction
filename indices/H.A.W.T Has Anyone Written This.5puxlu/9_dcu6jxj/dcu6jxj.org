Dumbledore uses lemon sherbets to test for time travellers. They've either got a compulsion on them that makes anyone who is in their correct time decline them, or "long distance" time travel creates a hankering for sour things. I just think it would be a cool way for Dumbledore to find out about someone travelling back in time.
