Steal away, but I might write a time travel fic and then I'm stealing it back... from myself I guess? When I had the idea, I was gonna use it to out time travel Harry to Dumbledore, or whoever goes back in time.

Maybe the further back you go, the stronger the craving gets? So Hermione takes one when offered, but in a time travel fic, they just stuff their mouth full of them? That would be kind of funny to write.
