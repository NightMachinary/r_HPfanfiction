Wow, talk about timing. I've got more of these than I care to count, and just made a forum on FFN so I could adopt some of them out, granted they were going to be in challenge format, since apparently the people on there love challenges so much.

Anyways, I' ll just post links to the GDocs pages, so I don' t take up half the page with one comment.

[[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Gc3Rj5wa-Q6veBo4Ad9BIL2BmSm0J52-tNzpEIO59KM][Harry Potter and the Baudelaire Botheration]], [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nFbMdmKyJGxxkMrvosK7uWQLP7G1NYQY20RFx1Ciux8][here it is in Challenge format]]. In case you couldn' t tell from the title, this is a HP + Series of Unfortunate Events crossover. The overall plot of this story is Harry Potter meeting the Baudelaire Orphans, and bonding with them, becoming their guardian at some point in time, and having a slightly less sad story for the Baudelaire Orphans.

[[https://drive.google.com/open?id=12ZoU5sk74-Xbwv754i0f4Ld_5pmHnWjRDFQTIrgWRH8][A Wise Man to Save us All]] Harry Potter + Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Crossover. Albus Dumbledore dies at the hands of Severus Snape, and Death is slightly annoyed. Needing another 30 years of life out of Albus, at the least, he de-ages him to his seventies, and sends him off to Tamriel, where dragons are returning, and the people need a hero.

These two are rough drafts, so excuse any poor writing or grammar mistakes in them, I just haven' t had the time to flesh these out completely. These poor plot bunnies need a home. I have others, but they' re not HP related, so I won' t post them here.
