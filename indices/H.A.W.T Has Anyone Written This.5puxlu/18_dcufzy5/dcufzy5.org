The Goblins are descended from the Fae, and are partially bound by the Old Laws. They are allowed to lie, but any contracts they make, they cannot break. This is why Wizarding World uses them as bankers, because they cannot break their word. However, each time a wizard breaks a contract, such as keeping a goblins object past it's return point, everyone directly involved in breaking the contract is put into a debt enforced by magic. The treaties prevent goblins from calling in these debts, unless they have a Goblin Rebellion which voids the Treaty. At which point, a lot of the richer families(those with goblin-made jewelry) lose huge sums of money, and in some cases turn into indentured servants.

This plot bunny is only really good for goblin centric fics, or those featuring a goblin rebellion, but it does explain a lot of the plot holes we always see with goblins, like why does nobody trust them, but they still have a monopoly on Britain's magical economy.
