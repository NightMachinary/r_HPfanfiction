Stolen Magic:

Hermione has her magic stolen by Draco Malfoy. He enacts a ritual to steal her magic and put it in a jar, hoping to later figure a way to add it to his own. It's the jar-device that makes this work, which is why it only is used on Hermione (though Draco has asked the crackpot who created it to make another...)

Why Hermione and not Harry? The irony is greater for Hermione, and moreover, her assistance isn't typically wand-work. On the flip side, Harry may be protected by Destiny. Better still- this is done over the summer, where Potter is inaccessible but Granger is an easy target. Should happen post 3rd-year, after she punches him. Couldn't happen after 4th, as she was more aware of being a potential victim after Skeeter's intrusion.

Hermione is Obliviated afterwards, such that she feels ill for the last few weeks of holiday and ends up skipping the Quidditch World Cup, but can't find the reason.

On the train, Draco confronts her, suggesting that she had no place there. She attempts a hex and gets nothing. Harry and Ron defend her, but Ron is somewhat spooked to see Hermione as a muggle; it takes very little for him to reject her for it. Ginny and the twins aren't much better, though they feel sorry for her.

She goes straight to McGonagall and is sent to Madame Pomfrey. This is where Draco is pointed out as the potential cause; he is summoned and gloats that he 'can just tell- a muggle smells wrong, and Granger has gotten more rank since last year.'

Snape is cruel and difficult, despite Albus' exhortations for him to investigate the matter. Snape does turn around and grill Draco about the procedure, learning how and why it was done. What makes him sit back and think is the potential impact to the magical world's dynamic, should the ritual become widely known. It was developed by a crackpot healer/alchemist that visited one of the Malfoy's parties- Draco overheard the conversation and agreed to fund his research from his own Trust. The Healer was looking into ways to kill off magical viruses by removing the 'food' upon which the illness fed. The magic is meant to be restored to the patient after the illness passes, but Draco saw no reason to fulfill that part of the ritual.

Snape launches his own research into how the stored magic can be used. It puts him in a multi-level quandary; the purebloods could shore up their squibs with stolen magic, but would be enacting what they accuse the mudbloods of doing in the first place. Such a published work could assure his status as an Alchemist, and could potentially even the playing field against Riddle. In fact, if HE could take Potter's magic and use the power of Harry's fate to put down the Dark Lord, Snape would earn a place of acclaim greater than even Albus Dumbledore...

Over time, Hermione's situation becomes widely known. The press twists it in various ways and Harry stands by Hermione throughout it, even after he is shanghai'd into the Tournament.

Sirius offers his condolences but doesn't act too interested in helping Hermione so much as aiding Harry in the Tournament. Hermione is put under indirect care of the school; she is barred from attending spell-related classes, which limits her to Muggle Studies, Care, History, Ancient Runes, Arithmancy and Astronomy. Eventually Hagrid has to suggest that she stay out of Care if she can't heal and resist minor damage like a magical can.

The nature of magic, however, is that a witch is not a container, but an aperture. The 'curse' redirected her attunement, like forcing her voice to come out of a distant microphone instead of her mouth. The jar is a Protean mana sink which infrequently spurts out wild magic, depending on Hermione's attempt to draw upon the flow. Draco keeps it in his dorm room, using the untraceable excess magic to cast forbidden spells and commit other minor crimes- the jar-device that the crackpot sold to him acts like a self-powered wand- it collects magic like a capacitor.

She still is magical, but her access is blocked and shunted elsewhere. She can still see ghosts and is unaffected by the muggle-repelling charm (though she can 'feel' it instructing her to leave). What she is also, ironically, is invisible to the magic-sensitive. Many wards and charms fail to react to her (as they are also shunted into the jar). The portraits and ghosts ignore her- only Peeves can still see and hear her, though he fakes not doing so at first. (She can be seen by magical creatures that have actual eyes, but the Dementors and she are mutually invisible, nor can a Boggart affect her).

I had more for this but I think I've lost the fire to truly commit to it.
