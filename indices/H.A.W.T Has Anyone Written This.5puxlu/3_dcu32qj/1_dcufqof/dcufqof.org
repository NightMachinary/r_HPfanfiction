Since Voldemort was basically a magical construct at that time, his body would crumple, his horcruxes would dissipate, and he would simply die.

The Burrow would implode on itself and kill/injure anyone inside, but its effect wouldn't be nearly as specular as Malfoy Manor's implosion. Similarly across the world, all expansion charms and magically supported structures would collapse on themselves and kill most people inside.

Items stored inside magically enlarged bags and trunks would simply be destroyed. All conjured objects would disappear, and all transfigured objects would revert to its original state.

All wards, including Fidelius Charms, would break and reveal their contents to the world. Muggles were baffled by the destructions and devastations suddenly revealed to them. National emergencies would be declared, military would be mobilized, and there would be stories for many years to come.
