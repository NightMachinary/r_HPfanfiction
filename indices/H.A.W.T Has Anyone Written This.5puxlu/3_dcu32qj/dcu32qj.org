I have always thought a fic about magic suddenly not working would be very interesting. It could even be a mystery for Harry and his friends to figure out why and how and try to bring it back.

How would pureblood families like the Malfoy's or even the Weasley's who seem to rely on magic for almost all basic things like cooking, travel, chores, etc. react and adapt to having to do everything the muggle way. What happens to Hogwarts and all the staff since classes are no longer possible. What would Voldemort and his death eaters do when no longer being able to do magic.
