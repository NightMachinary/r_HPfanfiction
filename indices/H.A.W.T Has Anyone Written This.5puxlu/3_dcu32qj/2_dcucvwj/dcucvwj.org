I read one like that, where it was an unbelievably lethal thing, due to undetectable size expansion collapsing killing a large amount of the population.

It made an assumption that diagon alley was using this and same with many homes and so forth for all countries.

However if it's the fic I'm thinking of, I can't recommend enough that you never read it.

Just checked, it wasn't. No clue where this snippet came from.
