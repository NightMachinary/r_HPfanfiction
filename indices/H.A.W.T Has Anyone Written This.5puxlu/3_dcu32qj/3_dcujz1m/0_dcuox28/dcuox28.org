"The walls around Malfoy gave a shudder, groaning as the magic that was stretching them apart to create more space faltered, before giving up. With an audible thwack, the walls snapped back into their original space, pushing all the items in the expanded space with them and slingshooting it all to the center of the room, where Malfoy stood with a wide open mouth. And that, kids, is how Lucius Malfoy died. Crushed by the 1966 sofa that had been given to his grandpa by good ole Voldemort."
