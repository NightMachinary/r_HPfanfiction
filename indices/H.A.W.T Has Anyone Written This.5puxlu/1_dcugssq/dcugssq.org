My plot bunny about a 'Muggleborn Dark Lord':

After the War, the pureblood establishment maintained a firm grip on power in Wizarding Britain. Although Muggleborns were released from Azkaban, they now faced legal discriminations. Furthermore, the pureblood establishment was trying to shift blames to 'being misled by that Half-Blood impostor Riddle'. The Wizengamot was tightening restrictions against 'dark creatures' further, even those injured by werewolves or born to them fell under discriminations. As a gesture, the establishment abandoned the Malfoys and heavily bribed the elder Weasleys, leading a split within the family. Harry and Hermione were thoroughly disappointed by all those developments and wanted to leave magical Britain all together. Ron and Ginny hesitated at first, but Arthur's vote for the 'Dark Creature Law' shattered their last piece of hope. In the end, Luna (who lost her father in Azkaban), Lavender (who was now classified as 'dark creature'), Dean, George, Angelina, Lee, Justin, and Andromeda joined them. They decided to call themselves "The Dirty Dozen".

In September 1998, they made their moves. Harry managed to use his fame to pressure the Goblins to transfer all his assets to the Muggle world. Justin managed to 'persuade' his father to give him significant amount of family assets. They further obtained alternate identities in the Muggle world. At Hermione's insistence, they headed to the Silicon Valley, now in the middle of late 90's Tech Mania, and quickly found out how easy it was to make big money there. They created the harmless sounding Otter Investments, with memory charms, legilimency, veritaserum, and imperius curse being its key competitive advantages. They mostly stayed away from controlling key government and military figures as these people were generally protected or under surveillance by their respective Ministries of Magic. However, the slow-moving wizarding world was no longer capable of keeping track of the rapidly changing tech industry, and it was exactly here where the big money of the future would be made.

The primary business of Otter Investments was to identify promising young Muggle entrepreneurs and 'persuade' them to give them equity stakes and stock options at no cost. They would then assist their new 'partners' in gaining lucrative deals, obtaining sensitive information, and receiving favorable court/government rulings.

When the tech boom reached its manic phase in early 2000, essentially worthless startups would be valued in billions of dollars at IPOs. They made their first millions during that time, which greatly wetted their appetitive and boosted their ambitions. They were able to significantly scale up their operations. Google's IPO in year 2004 turned them into billionaires first time. Helen Farmer (aka Hermione Granger) became a rising star in the hedge fund/venture capital industry.

Meanwhile in magical Britain, things were getting worse. Ruling elites and old families strengthened their hold on power and reinforced the social castes. Muggleborns were now completely excluded from lucrative jobs, and many left. Otter Investments, however, was able to exploit this situation and recruit more loyal wizards and witches.

During the 2008/2009 global financial crisis, they were able to take advantage of the collapse in asset prices and the subsequent QE (quantitative easing). They gained their first foothold in major financial institutions, which opened up a side route into the political circle. But as a side effect, MACUSA was tipped off, finally became suspicious of their operations, and began to investigate.

To counter this threat, the company decided to form its own private army. Fortunately, the wars in Middle East and the chaos in magical Britain offered significant influx of reliable new recruits, both Muggle and Magical. Many former Muggle military bases, often sold at bargain prices by their governments, would offer excellent hideouts and training grounds.

After 2012, MACUSA was becoming a major threat. Otter Investments, now a global hybrid Muggle/Magical Corporation with hundred thousands of employees/followers and hundreds of billion dollars in assets, saw various Ministries of Magic as the key threat to its goal of global domination. It began implementing plans that would use Muggles as a proxy to destroy magical governments and old magical establishments, while using the company as a refuge for surviving Magicals. With magical competitions gone, Otter Investments believed it would be a very advantageous position to dominate both worlds.

One key milestone was achieved in 2016 when a certain weak-minded billionaire US presidential candidate was brought under control. Significant voter manipulations resulted in his victory that surprised both pundits and the MACUSA. Once in office, the new POTUS worked immediately on plans destroying the magical establishment.
