Voldemort's body dies before they destroy the last Horcrux, leaving him a wraith until he can be destroyed in a body again, but makes it as difficult as possible by body hopping from person to person all over the globe with Harry&Co chasing his trail of destruction.

Also, despite me having put a lot of work into figuring out the timeline of this, I'll post a story idea I've been working on here. AU Canon where Dumbledore dies in the fight with Grindlewald but takes the dark lord down with him. Someone in the present day (where Harry and co are like 40 having already dealt with Voldemort) goes back in time to try and kill Dumbledore before he gets to Grindlewald, thereby changing the course of history. Harry has to go back in time to stop him, ending up smack in the middle of ww2. He requests help from the King of the day, (with the aid of Elizabeth/William depending on if you think the queen would have kicked it by then) becomes the leader of a special operations group in the British army and ends up chasing a younger Dumbledore through France and Germany after the Normandy invasion. Over the next year or so he and his unit of soldiers work their way into Nazi Germany and eventually witness the duel between Dumbledore and Grindlewald. Only for the original time traveler to kill Dumbledore mid duel forcing Harry and his unit to kill the time traveler and Grindlewald at which point Harry realizes that he's only fulfilling a timeline that had already existed. Where he was always meant to come back in time to deal with Grindlewald and Dumbledore never actually got the chance to avenge his sister. When he goes back forwards in time to his own timeline he let's everyone else believe that Dumbledore is the Hero everyone thinks he is, because really, how much more publicity does Harry actually need?
