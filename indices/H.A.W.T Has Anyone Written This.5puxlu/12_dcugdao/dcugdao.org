One idea that I like was briefly looked at in a collection of oneshots, but when harry does his detentions in 5th year he writes "I will not tell lies" with a blood quill, hundreds of times. If you accept the fan theory of blood quills being used to create binding contracts, it would be easy to have a situation where that detention changes the course of the universe, as the binding becomes tighter and tighter the more detentions that Harry attends.
