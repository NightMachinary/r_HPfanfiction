I always got the impression due to the Statute of Secrecy, all magical creatures lived in strictly magical areas, like the Forbidden Forest and the Great Lake. So mermaids no longer live in the oceans, but in lakes around the world.

But creatures around the world forming a revolution would be awesome. Mermaids, Elves, Centaurs, Goblins, Dwarves, all fed up with the destruction of the environment. Wizards flailing around losing their minds trying to stop this.

Global Warming will destroy the world and bring upon Armageddon. But not in the way we think.
