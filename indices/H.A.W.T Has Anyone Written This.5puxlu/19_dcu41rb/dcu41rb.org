I like the idea of Tolkien Elves getting fed up with humans destroying forests, and deciding to either go to come out, breaking the Statute of Secrecy and their own self-imposed seclusion from other beings, to tell the Men off, or to just straight up go to war. Wizards, of course, thinking they control all aspects of magical life, have a fit and try to stop them before non-magics discover magic.

They could, perhaps, be Avari, who did decide to stay in Middle-Earth until the end of time.

I would really, really, like background stories for ghosts, especially Binns. What sucked all the joy out of life for him? Why was he the way he was? Why was teaching so important to him he couldn't retire after dying? Why was he so focused on Goblins? Was that just what he was focusing on when he died, and so never moved on from the subject, or did he have a secret game plan?
