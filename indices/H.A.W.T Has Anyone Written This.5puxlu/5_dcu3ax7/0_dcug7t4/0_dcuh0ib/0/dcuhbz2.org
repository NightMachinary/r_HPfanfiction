Cinematically and graphically, the new ones are great. But game mechanics wise, I still like the old SMAC.

Magic, as described in the HP world, seems to allow direct access to fundamental physical forces through a person's will power. If combined with Muggle technologies, would make even interstellar space colonization magnitudes easier. For example:

- Apparition, Port Key, and Floo Travel are basically short distance worm holes through space time. Port Keys could potentially be used to build space stations easily and quickly; Apparitions allow easy transport of astronauts to and from Low Planetary Orbits; Floo Travel connects two points of heat sources, so one fanfic introduces the concept of 'Floo Jump' (as opposed to Hyperspace Jump) to allow interstellar travel using another star as target heat source.

- Broomsticks and Flying Carpets are basically gravity manipulation devices, which could be used to generate Earth-like gravity in various environs, crucial for the health of human beings.

- Conjuration, duplication (Gemino curse) of materials are examples of creating matters temporarily from quantum foam(?), thus using far less energy as required by the Energy Matter Equivalence (E=MC^{2).} This kind of magic would render material scarcity on new colonies a non issue.

- Space extension charm create pocket dimensions in our current universe. It's dreadfully useful, and you can use your imagination to think about all the possibilities.
