Dumbledore memory charmed all the Dursleys and Harry multiple times as he was growing up to cover up his magic and give him "a normal childhood." This inadvertently led to the Dursleys' fear and hatred of magic, and caused part of Harry's personality to eventually be blocked off behind the memory charms. Lockhart makes this worse with a few charms in second year, but exposure to the dementors starts to crack the charms.
