I've had another one: Boy-Who-Lived in reverse. Dudley becomes the chosen one, Petunia and Vernon die, Lily and James raise him.

I think it'd be a good look at the difference between two sisters, how they react to each other's deaths, the hand they get in life, and the way they treat each others orphaned children.

It'd take some fiddling, either of the prophecy, or with Dudley's age. Maybe Severus leads him to Petunia instead of Lily, maybe Petunia and Vernon baby-sit/house-sit for Lily and James, and Voldemort doesn't realise there are two boys, with Harry being in the bath maybe, or in another room. It would also require Voldemort to have done less research, and be unfamiliar with Lily, and Petunia to look somewhat more like her. Maybe strawberry blonde hair instead of the pure blonde.
