I always thought that the reasoning for Dumbledore not being able to compete with Voldemort himself is because he lacks raw magical power so that's where Harry comes into play, and while Harry would definitely add oomph, he would still have a lot of trouble handling Voldemort in a duel. The basilisk could still very well happen, as it was mostly out of Harry's control, same for the Dementors and the Tri-Wizard tournament. Although I highly doubt Harry would continue with his quidditch dream, he would likely opt for Duelling in junior divisions with Dumbledore as his sponsor. And the conflict with the Dementors would only come into play much later when Sirius is in Hogwarts and Dumbledore voices his suspicion that he isn't responsible for Voldemort's finding of the Potters. So we get a quicker version of the "Patronus learning session" that we got with Remus. But after the fifth year, I agree, things will start getting crazy since we make Harry competent while learning secret magic, we have to make Voldemort ten times as competent with more secret magic to boot so there would be extreme and large-scale world building going on as the Death Eaters slowly take over Magical Britain. Like I said, it's tough.
