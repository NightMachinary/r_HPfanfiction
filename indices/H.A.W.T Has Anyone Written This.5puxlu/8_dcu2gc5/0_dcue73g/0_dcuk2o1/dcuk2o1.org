I kinda feel the complete opposite. I think Harry, while he has the potential to be a great wizard, does not have anywhere near the potential to go toe to toe with Voldemort. If Dumbledore "stepped up his game" and tried to turn Harry into someone who could confront Voldemort head-to-head in a traditional duel, I feel like the only possible outcome is a very dead Harry. A more talented dead Harry, but still dead.
