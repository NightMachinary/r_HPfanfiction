Definitely not. Voldemort and Harry could be equal in terms of potential power, it's just that in canon, we don't have that much grasp on either of them. Sure, Harry managed to cast the Patronus Charm, which in itself is said to show a Wizard's power. But outside of casting their signature spells of Disarming and Killing, we rarely see Voldemort or Harry use anything else in combat.

"Traditional Duelling" is definitely not what Dumbledore would train Harry to do in the case of him becoming Harry's mentor. I think it was the fic "Gods Amongst Men" or something like that, that made the distinction between Duelling and Combat. Combat is using every means necessary to destroy your opponent. I would imagine the first battle in the graveyard as being a cocky-full-of-himself Harry attempting to duel Voldemort. Then getting utterly destroyed by Voldemort's sheer magical power (imagine torrents of flame, the very ground forming to lava etc...), and only being able to get away with a wandless summoner brought about by a huge wave of fear and anger that Harry was beaten so badly by the man who killed his father.

Dumbledore isn't a 'try' guy. If he thought that Harry didn't have the potential to beat Voldemort, he wouldn't waste his time training him. That's what I think happened in canon. At first, Dumbledore wanted to see if Harry had any talent, maybe they could circumvent the need for miracles should Voldemort come for Harry again? But sadly, Harry had no talent with magic whatsoever, and instead spent time around people. So Dumbledore tells him that the key to winning is love, blue-pilling Harry into believing that no matter what he did, he would win. That's why in the end, Harry never asked for training. So that's why I said "a more realistic Harry", aka: Talented, Powerful MC. Due to the fact that he is the son of two magic prodigies, it's only natural that he would be naturally powerful and magically talented, along with being away from magic the entirety of his life, he would develop a great curiosity for spells and such. Also, let's not forget that one of the only Muggle-Born/Pureblood Children we've seen is Tonks, saying he has special abilities isn't far fetched. Given time, Harry could definitely beat Voldemort. Not with any ease, and he would likely lose a lot of people along the way, but he would do so.
