Harry is mentored by Dumbledore after the events of his first year at Hogwarts. Now follow Harry as he unlocks secret abilities he never knew he had, all while dealing with Basilisks, Dementors, Tri-Wizard Tournaments, and more ... This type of fic always had so much potential for world-building and character development, I'm sure that if someone did it right it would become a staple in fanfiction everywhere. I tried making this fic multiple times, the ideas kept flowing but I could never translate it into a well-rounded project.
