I've had this idea for awhile of a Potter who is basically little more than a squib, like literally can't perform anything beyond some of the most basic spell.

But he does get to inherit the Potter fortune, and ultimately that's the power Voldemort knows not. Pure unadulterated money. He uses it to fund the discovery of weapons/magical objects from across the globe or to pay someone to create them. A good way to subvert the stupid "inheritance" shit, while also playing with concept. It would also be just fun to see somethign close to a "Magical Batman"
