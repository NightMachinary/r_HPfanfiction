Luna enlists the help of her friends, the fairies, asking them to get all the children who believe in magic to clap, causing magic to strengthen. Hermione hypothesises that the clapping causes the latent magic all children are born with (and that some adults, called overgrown children by "proper" adults, manage to keep) to vibrate with the same frequency, around the world, thus giving magic renewed energy. Magic takes two careful steps back again, away from Hermione, and thus, the rest of her kind. Fairies drop dead by children's beds, causing mass hysteria around the Northern Hemisphere as children freak out.

Luna finally give up, and stops preventing the team of Unspeakables from 'dealing' with the Hermione problem. Ron is heart-broken that his wife died while 'experimenting with spells', and Rose Granger-Weasley, aged nine, was traumatised by having witnessed it.

Luna becomes suspicious about what actually happened that day, 24 years ago.
