- Harry Potter gets so annoyed with the prophecy that he decides to make it his life goal to fulfill every single prophecy he finds in the hall of prophecies, so other people don't have to.
- Gender-swapped golden trio: fem!harry, fem!ron and male!hermione, just for the hell of it.
- Dumbledore travels back in time to correct all the mistakes he ever made
- Harry doesn't want to compete in the triwizard tournament and becomes annoyed that such a thing as a binding magical contract is even possible without him entering himself. As revenge he proceeds to also confound the goblet and enter everyone he is annoyed with at that particular moment: dumbledore, snape, ron, fudge, malfoy and voldemort.
- harry potter becomes a teacher - in the muggle world that is. He proceeds to tell one bullshit story to his students after another, yet somehow always manage to back them up with proof (obviously by cheating with magic). Maybe told froom the perspective of his students?
- the dursleys find harry on their doorstep and assume that this is some extreme form of ding-dong-ditching, and proceed to tell everyone about it. The story becomes viral in the muggle world, and dumbledore has to wxplain everyone why he thought that it'd be funny to prank some muggles by leaving the saviour of the magical world on their doorstep.
- A typical over-the-top 'evil manipulative dumbledore' story, only that harry simply dies half-way through the story, and now dumbledore has to scramble and somehow make all of his longterm plans work without harry
- Harry travels back in time, but since an alternative version of him still exists, he has to take up a cover identity. He decides to take over the identity of fudge, and makes a hobby out of carefully wording all the laws he gets bribed for to pass in such a way, that they end up having the opposite effect of what the intended consequences were.
- umbridge and harry somehow accidentally swap bodies
- harry's lightning bolt scar also looks a lot like the sigrune - as a result he basically gets adopted by a bunch of neonazis, who proceed to protect him from dudley and co, which obviously has some weird consequences for his personality development
