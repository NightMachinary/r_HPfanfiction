I don't think 'slash' is the issue, it's more to do with how explicit they are. Perhaps slash writers are less likely to write non-explicit romance, I don't know. I have one short story on there which I wrote for a smut challenge and an explicit chapter in a story which is posted in its censored form on ffn. Those aren't slash. They don't get many readers. Perhaps that's why.
