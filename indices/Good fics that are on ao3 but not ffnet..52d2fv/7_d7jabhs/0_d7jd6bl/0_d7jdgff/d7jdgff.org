Lol at that summary. Good question though. Personally I think the best slash is as good as the best het and that the worst slash is as bad as the worst Het. I've read terrible fics in both camps so I'm not sure where the stereotype that slash is so bad came from.

On ao3 there's just more slash, so there's more great slash and more terrible slash. I have my bookmarks all stored on there with comments so you can look through those if you're interested in finding something in particular. [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/katelawyer86/bookmarks]]
