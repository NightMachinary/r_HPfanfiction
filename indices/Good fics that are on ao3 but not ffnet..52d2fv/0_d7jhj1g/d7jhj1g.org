Esama has some good stuff and is an ao3 exclusive. I really like /Island of Fire/, where Harry and friends build a civilisation from ground up. linkao3(3236603)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/users/dirgewithoutmusic/pseuds/dirgewithoutmusic][dirgewithoutmusic]] has several popular short stories that are character studies of minor characters, and a few what--if scenarios based around who raises Harry.

/Knives/ is my favorite ao3 work. Ginny attempts to take revenge on Lucius for the diary incident. Second person narrative, dark themes, not a cathartic story. linkao3(982121)

L'optimisme: An AU story of Albus and Gellert after the latter leaves Godric's Hollow. Employs rather flowery prose, heavy use of imagery. linkao3(2428940)

Left Hook: Ginny Time-travel fic. linkao3(4904485)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/users/jenorama/pseuds/jenorama][Jenorama]] has several short stories (and one longer WiP) featuring canon relationships. [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Inell/pseuds/Inell/works?fandom_id=136512][Inell]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Ely_Baby/pseuds/Ely_Baby][Ely_Baby]] write mainly smutty stories, pairings all over the place.

Other good ones: linkao3(565572; 396278; 27105; 142763; 76683)
