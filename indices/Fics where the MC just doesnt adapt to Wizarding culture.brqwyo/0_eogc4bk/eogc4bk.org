You generally have to put up with Hermione as main characters in these kind of fics. Almost all authors who write them have a very dismal view of Magical Britain. Examples:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): After overthrowing the Ministry because of a marriage law, they executed most of the Wizengamot and a large portion of the traditional establishment, completely reorganized the Ministry, significantly altered Hogwarts curriculum, redefined all magical creature laws, replaced quills with pens, stopped wearing robes, and radically changed how magical wars would be fought. Foreign pureblood regimes, however, would have none of that.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10322302/1/Screw-Them][Screw Them]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10533939/1/We-re-Screwed][We're Screwed]], linkffn(10533939): Harry and his supporters created a rival magical society that eventually undermined Hogwarts and Ministry. This author is in a way more radical than Starfox5, who at least depicts Magical France as a worse shit hole than Britain.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1227033/Marquis-Black][Emperor]], linkffn(1227033): The first chapter is the Epilogue and depicts Harry ordering the destruction of Hogwarts. That should tell you enough how Harry views the traditional magical societies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8837257/1/Wizards-Fall][Wizards Fall]], linkffn(8837257): Harry and his friends built a rival society and eventually screwed over Magical Britain using some kind of schemes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]], linkffn(6160345): Harry and Ginny left Magical Britain after offing Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Badly traumatized and deranged Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan travelled back in time, killed their enemies again, did the Goblins in, completely shook up Magical Britain's system, and left the country with Sirius.
