A brilliant fic. So much Worldbuilding in terms of dark magicand Horcruxes. It's very good and interesting. But it's a Tomarry fic. Still I would highly recommend you to check it out. Even if you are not into that, it's slow-burny enough that you get a lot of focus on Voldemort and it's from his perspective. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16497056]])
