Thanks for the recommendation. It's actually really good. Also tbh Tomarry is not my favorite pairing, but none is really if the characters get too lovey-dovey. One of the reasons I really enjoyed the original series was because, even though novels about teenagers, they focused on the action, while the romance fell in the background.
