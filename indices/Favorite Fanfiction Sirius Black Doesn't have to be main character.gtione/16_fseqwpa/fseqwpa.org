[[https://medium.com/@Frameworkisdigimon/secret-kept-secret-lost-410bcc2cb21f][Because I'm a complete egomaniac... my oneshot!]] Sirius /is/ the secret keeper. He /would/ die for them. That's really all that there is to it because, well, oneshot.

I'm also partial to the muggle Sirius in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13312738/1/The-Granger-Principle][The Granger Principle]], which is about a witch Hermione who got stuck in a muggle AU and wants to get back (WIP, very regular updates). Plot spoiler... At least, it was about that. She got back and I stopped reading. It's still being updated and I'm not sure what the plot is any more.

I also remember liking [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16807438/chapters/39450802][Magpies]], but I don't know if I liked it for its Sirius or not. It's a bunch of thematically linked oneshots about various Blacks.
