How about a Sirius who uses his political influence to rid the Ministry of corruption, with Hermione as his assistant and with Harry and Ron doing auror work and hunting thieves and dark wizards (those not in the government)?

At least that's what Harry and Ron think is happening. Unbeknownst to them, Sirius and Hermione have another method to reduce the number of rich wizards bribing politicians: Breaking into their places and stealing the bribe money, Hollywood heist movie style.

Harry and Hermione are main characters, Sirius, Ron and Mundungus Fletcher the most important side characters.
