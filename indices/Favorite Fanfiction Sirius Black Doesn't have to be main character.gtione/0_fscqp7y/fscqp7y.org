No one's mentioned linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)? I'd better do that, then.

Sirius escapes from Azkaban when Harry is eight, and without any leads on Peter, he instead checks on Harry - and when he finds him unhappy, he offers to take him. Which triggers a huge manhunt in response to the "kidnapping", brings Remus out of seclusion, leads to Snape finding out about Peter's role as Secret Keeper, and accelerates a lot of canon events, but above all, gives Harry a few years of actual childhood.

No one is overpowered, nor bashed, but there's a lot of really good fleshing out of characters like Tonks, Remus, Marlene McKinnon, Gawain Robards, and even Snape. Book 1 is pre-Hogwarts, books 2-4 cover Harry's first three years, book 5 is in progress.
