I really love scenes like Harry and Sirius playing hide and seek, shortly after they move into Grimmauld Place. Sirius starts on the first floor and thinks Harry has to be trapped upstairs, but Harry persuades Kreacher to elf-apparate him downstairs, by reminding him that Sirius doesn't like to lose ;). Sirius eventually finds him in the kitchen eating fresh scones.

Or when Harry pranks Sirius (in book 2, actually) by inviting his primary school friend Hermione to visit; Harry has recently learned that she's a witch, but hasn't told Sirius yet, sending Sirius into a tizzy as he tries to hide how blatantly magical Grimmauld Place is. Harry busts a gut after Sirius drops a wand and accidentally transfigures a teapot.

They're just such kid things :). Harry needs more of that.
