Question: How are they with nicknames? Some stories where Sirius is in Harry's life more, is that he gives Harry a name like Prongslet or Pup or something, which... I'm not the biggest of fan of, tbh. Though if he was given a nickname at a young age, and the nickname stops when he's a teenager, or he's only called that in private, I can be more accepting of it.
