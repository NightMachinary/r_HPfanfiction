linkffn(Vivicendium) is pretty decent with a slow burn romance but is a little silly at times. Takes place during SB's 7th year (maybe 6th, not super clear) . The main is SB's love interest with him as a secondary character. Not sure if you'll enjoy but it features him prominently.

First time using the ffn bot so not sure if it'll work.
