  It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

  Sirius Black loses the argument with the Sorting Hat and is Sorted Slytherin. He has no idea what could possibly be worse than this.

#+begin_quote
  Sirius shuts his mouth, hides his views and does all he can to protect himself and his brother. This is why the hat put him in Slytherin. (In another life, perhaps he was more like Andromeda. Perhaps he rebelled, lived his life bright and loud and brave and Gryffindor. But in this life, Sirius Black decided that surviving was more important to him than living, and he adjusted his actions accordingly.) Sirius Black is a Good Pureblood Son, and everything changes.

#+begin_quote
  In the summer of 1979, Regulus Black vanished from British wizarding society with horcrux in hand, ducking his head down into the obscurity of a French village to complete his task of destroying Slytherin's locket - and with it, a fragment of the Dark Lord's soul. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again, sixteen years later, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict, with a very different set of allies. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the fog of the brewing Second War, tugging forth both old conflicts and new.

The ex-Death Eater strikes a bargain with Dumbledore, cooperation in exchange for his family's safety.

  Wasted potential is far more offensive to a teacher than outright mediocrity, and it is for that reason, chiefly, that she considers him to be one of the great disappointments of her career. If, then, she should keep seeing potential where everyone else has given up, and if they are to be forever discussing what he will make of himself, so be it.Minerva wonders if he is as aware of the patterns as she is.Six conversations between Minerva McGonagall and Sirius Black, 1976-1996.
