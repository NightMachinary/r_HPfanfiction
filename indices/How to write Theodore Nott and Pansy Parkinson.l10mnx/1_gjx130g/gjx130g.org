I'm currently writing a fic that features Theo Nott travelling back in time with Harry.

The whole background I've got for him in my fic is:

1. he watched his father murder his mother so he can see thestrals
2. his father abuses him and wants him to join the death eaters but he doesn't want to
3. he's quiet and standoffish, doesn't make friends easily
4. he's very intelligent and has an interest in making magical items (I'm taking this from something I heard about in the Cursed Child, mainly the point where he was arrested or something for making a time-turner)
5. he wants to be an unspeakable because he likes playing with magic and enchanting (spelling, charming?) things

Basically, most people write Theo as a quiet and standoffish but intelligent person.
