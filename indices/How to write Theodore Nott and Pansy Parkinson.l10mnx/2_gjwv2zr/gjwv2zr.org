Pansy was written as the "anti-Hermione" and based all the girls who bullied JKR when she was young. So she comes off as horrible because the author has literally stated that she loathes her. She describes her as resembling a hideous pug.

That said. In reality, were the girls who were bullies in YOUR school ugly? Generally not. Usually they were rich and pretty; otherwise who else would put up with their meanness? Could they be annoying/stupid/shallow? Sure, Pansy can still be both of these things. There are plenty of reasons Draco might not have wanted to marry her. But for her to have her oft-echoed "gang of Slytherin girls" following her around all the time, I tend to prefer her shown as, at the least, well-off and attractive (not necessarily a gorgeous, classic beauty, but at least appealing to some).

Parkinson also makes the Sacred 28. So stories that emphasize her bloodline as being on par with Malfoy/Black could justify her not being that good looking but still popular, but I don't often (if ever) see that.
