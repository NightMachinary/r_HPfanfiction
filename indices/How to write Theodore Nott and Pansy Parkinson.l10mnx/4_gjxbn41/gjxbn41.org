Well I guess it depends what kind of story it is.

There is not much in canon but it depends do you want them as villains or to flesh them out/possibly redeem them.

Lovesbitca8 has a series that's Draco/Hermione but we a lot of Pansy, Blaise, Theo as Draco friends. The first is linkao3(The Right Thing To Do) (post book 7) and then there is linkao3(All the Wrong Things) which is that story from Draco POV. Then the AU of this story is linkao3(The Auction) which is an AU where Voldemort won so we see all the same characters and parallels but in another universe if that makes sense. The Auction is the only one I read and even if Draco/Hermione isn't my fav ship it's a good read. I really liked Pansy in it, you see more of her than Theo but he's there as well. Perhaps you see more of him in the Right Thing To Do. There is also a story I have not read but looks good that is set in same universe that is short and it's Pansy/Neville linkao3(A Dress with Pockets)

Also, I only got to chapter 17 of this but linkao3(Isolation) is Draco/Hermione but apparently Theo and Blaise show up later and are characterized well.

I have read linkao3(Breath Mints/Battle Scars) which again Draco/Hermione but you see a lot of Theo and Pansy.

I think both characters have potential depending how you want to work them. Pansy is a lot meaner than Hermione is or at least more of a bully. Pansy and Theo could also been seen as morally grey which can be interesting to write. We know she tries to get with and does date Draco for years but doesn't end up with him and even when she's with him seems insecure in their relationship (asking if he thinks Ginny is pretty), she also must take what happens to him in the later books hard. She seems bigoted but you could redeem her if you wanted. I believe her dad is a Death Eater? I haven't read the later books in ages. She seems insecure. She can also be written to be the type to ruin certain things instead of hoping then being disappointed. We don't know much about her friend group or where she stands among the Slytherins so that's something to play with.

Theo is in the higher level potions and he saw his dad murder his mom (?) when he was young and his dad is a death eater. I mean you can have him really lean into that or you can have him hate the Death Eaters and his dad due to how it tore apart his entire family.
