Pansy is hateful and cowardly. I'm sad we didn't see more Theo in the books, so you could process of eliminate him as a super bully or overtly evil.

Also something must have happened between Pansy and Draco post books because he goes on to marry a sweet Slytherin girl who actually doesn't care much about blood purity and pretty much gives up her life to have scorpius even though she knows about her family's blood curse.
