I wrote Theo into my AU as someone who knew that Emperor Voldemort had no clothes. His Dad was a DE but I don't think he wanted Theo to be one. In my story Nott Snr dies and Theo talks about struggling with loving his Dad despite feeling he shouldn't because of what he did.

He is cautious about the new post Voldy world but reasonably open to giving Muggle things a go.
