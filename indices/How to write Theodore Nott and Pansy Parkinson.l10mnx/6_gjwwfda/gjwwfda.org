I like the depiction of Pansy in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22431970/chapters/53596558][The Bucket List]] by Galla Placidia (also available as a [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25642150/chapters/62248990][podfic]]). She's very posh and gossipy, but also loyal to her friends (the summary describes her as "devoted bitch queen").
