  Harry finds out that his dad is alive, has been the whole time. Instead of being overjoyed, Harry's disgusted. His dad left earth and abandoned his friends. Every painful thing he's ever gone through can be traced back to one man. Now Harry's got super strength he can't control and an almost unnecessary amount of magical power. His dad might be living it up with the Avengers now but not for long. With the help of his friends, Harry comes up with a plan for revenge. Get ready Avengers, Harry's out to punch a god.

  Vegas Marriage Challenge with a slight twist. Harry wakes up after one too many soco and cokes married to a beautiful blonde woman who has a computer for a brain, a connection to one of the richest men on the planet and a weird affinity for Nena and Remy Zero. Good thing he likes her, because this is definitely one of those til death do us part marriages.
