Here are my two favorites (they're both slash, so beware of that if it's not your thing):

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/314234][The Path of Flame]] - FMA/HP - Roy Mustang adopts Harry - only covers the first two HP books and a bunch of little side stories, but /man/ this was /excellent/. I don't remember needing a ton of FMA background for it. It's more of a "how would Harry change if he were raised by someone loving and supportive like Mustang, and what happens when Ed runs into both of their lives?" RoyEd is the pairing here, though it seemed to be setting up for Drarry. It doesn't get that far (le. sigh.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13351587/chapters/30570351][Wolves and Lambs]] - Gundam Wing/HP - Remus Lupin is the father of a Gundam Pilot. I'd have to go back and do another reread, but I /think/ this might read okay even if you don't know a lot about GW, because none of the HP characters do, which involves enough exposition between the groups that it should read fine. You get a lot more nuances if you know GW, but I think you're okay. This is hands down one of my favorite crossovers /ever/. /Ever/. The worldbuilding to make these fit together is /beautiful/. It is a WIP, but it's 90k, so even though it's a WIP, it's amazing.

A gen one that I remember (though /wow/ it's been a long time):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1995083/1/Crumpets-Aren-t-My-Style][Crumpets aren't my style]] - Stargate SG-1/HP. I remember this being really good, and I think it was one of the OG crossovers.
