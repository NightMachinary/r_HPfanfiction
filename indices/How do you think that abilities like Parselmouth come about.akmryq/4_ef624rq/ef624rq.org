Yeah that would make sense! I always figured like the way some ppl seemed to be born with a magical affinity or something (for an area of magic) magical gifts acted similarly. like very occasionally someone's magic is compatible with talking to snakes and it's more a random mutation/adaptation that keeps going down a bloodline.

I've seen a few fics feature a similar idea that there are so few recorded in UK history bc there aren't many snakes in the UK, and other countries with larger populations of snakes have far more parselmouths.

Maybe it was a common mutation in a country with plenty snakes, and its presence elsewhere is due to immigration from those countries across the world and their descendants.
