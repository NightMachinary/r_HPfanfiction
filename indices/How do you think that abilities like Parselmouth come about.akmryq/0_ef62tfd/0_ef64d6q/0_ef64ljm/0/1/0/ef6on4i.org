Well, I was imagining one of those clever Boggarts who learn to take on a single form of their choice rather than constantly change based on who's looking at them. For example, Pottermore mentions a particular Boggart who haunted an alleyway as a fictitious human serial killer, for several years.

(Alternatively, if you want to be grimdark about it... what about a woman whose worst fear is being raped?)
