Well, in the early versions of Arthurian legends, Merlin was mostly known as a Seer, but his other main magical attribute was that he could take on any shape he liked, any man, any beast. And there's one legend where he takes on an especially horrid, monstrous shape to deliver a particularly scary prophecy, because he's awesome like that.

Separately, there's this notion (though when it dates back to is unclear; certainly there was no such concept in the very earliest records of Myrddin) that Merlin was sired by a shapeshifted demon, hence his sort-of-immortality and his great powers.

My theory is that Merlin was actually a half-human whose father was a /Boggart/ (which is definitely the sort of critter that Muggle legends would record as a "demon"), hence his ability to change his appearance at will. Metamorphmagi are all distant descendants either of Merlin, or (if the same thing ever happened before or since, which is perhaps somewhat doubtful) of other Half-Boggarts. Past the first generation, the gift was diluted somewhat (think Flitwick, who is still Goblin-sized but lacks any overt Goblin physical traits), but never went away completely; such that modern Metamorphmagi can innately turn into any people they like but have great difficulty with wholly nonhuman forms.

(Fun fact: no, the Blacks aren't descended from Merlin, don't you think they'd brag about it all the time if they were? Tonks got it from Ted, who is the great-great-etc.-great-grandson of Merlin's Squib daughter.)
