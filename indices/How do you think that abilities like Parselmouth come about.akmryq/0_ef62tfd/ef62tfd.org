We know Parseltongue is hereditary with the Slytherin line passing it on. Harry gains it from his encounter with Voldemort and the resulting Horcrux in his scar (also proof of some sort of hereditary power). The earliest Parseltongue we know is Herpo the Foul, who also created the first Basilisk.

The question of course is if he created the Basilisk because he was a Parselmouth, or that he became a Parselmouth due to creating the Basilisk. It might indeed be some sort of side effect, either from magical experiments or accidental magic or some sort of evolution or mutation. I suspect it's similar to for instance metamorphs (also hereditary).
