I believe that the Gift of Parseltongue is an artificial creation --- there are, no doubt, magical ways to implant knowledge of languages into people's minds, or Barty Crouch Sr. couldn't speak 200 languages; my theory has always been that after learning snake language the hard way, someone (possibly Herpo, possibly someone even further back) found a way not only to transfer this knowledge artificially, but for this transfer to become automatic to all of their descendants.

As for there being so few Parselmouths, I don't think it's a matter of the gift disappearing; there's just not that many descendants of Herpo the Foul around. I have little doubts that Salazar Slytherin (who, going by his first name, has continental roots) was the first Parselmouth to step foot in Britain. And considering the Wizarding World's small population size /combined/ with blood-purists' pickiness when it comes to who they can marry, there's nothing weird about there only being a handful of Slytherin descendants in the present day.
