I am not a fan of being a Descendent of one of the Founders of Hogawrs as being some special thing, I like to think that Practically all Purebloods in the UK are Descendent of at least two Founders.

But that might be because of a story I read were Harry Finds out he Is the Decedent of Gryffindor and gets a Little Certificate and is told by The Golbins that he is not that special and the Decedent's of Gryffindor have a Club were they meet monthly or something like that. ( I forget how often or were they meet but I definitely remember a sarcastic Goblin Giving him the Certificate)
