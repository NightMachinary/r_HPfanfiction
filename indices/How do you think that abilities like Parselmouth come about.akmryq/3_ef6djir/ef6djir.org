I think the weird magical gifts were bonded to a bloodline using magic that has since been outlawed and/or forgotten. I want to use this idea as a sticking point in the muggleborn/pureblood debates: purebloods are like we need to keep these gifts alive and adding muggleborns won't help (although this clearly isn't true: see Tonks); muggleborns are like, how are we supposed to start magical bloodline gifts when you've forbidden all of the relevant magic?
