My theory is magic is not inherent in b=human genes. Witches and wizards all are descendant from magical creatures (thing Fleur and Hagrid but several generations removed). This means that you can get abilities that pass down in bloodlines due to creature ancestry. For example, Hagrid's descendants (if he has any) have some natural immunity to minor spells, while Fleur's descendants are great at fire spells. Parselmouths have naga or lamia ancestors.

All this is an often used trope that I like.
