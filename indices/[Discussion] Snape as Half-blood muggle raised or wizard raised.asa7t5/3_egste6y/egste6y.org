I don't know if he'd watch cartoons on Saturday (especially something as Amercian like /Yogi Bear/): don't forget he's a lower-class British kid in the 1970's, not a middle-class American kid from the 1990's. And yes, I do find it likely he was "homeschooled," inasmuch as he was schooled at all prior to Hogwarts.

But he shouldn't be entirely ignorant of the Muggle world either, of course. You're right.
