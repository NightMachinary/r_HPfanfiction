  I see him growing up watching Yogi Bear and other cartoons on Saturday

Snape grew up in the 60s, and enough is written about him to know that he hated his father - from joining the Death Eaters to considering himself as a member of the Prince family. Snape also came from a low class family. Put both of these together, and you get some sort of domestic violence and/or abuse aimed at either Snape or his mother.

From all of that, we can safely say that an American cartoon like Yogi Bear made no appearances in the Snape home. That is, if they even had a TV.
