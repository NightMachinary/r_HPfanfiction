Okay I get the Yogi Bear thing! Sheesh, my point was that people like to make him a moron when it comes to simple muggle things. I don't even thing that PureBloods are that stupid when it comes to using muggle things, such as pens, paper doors ect.

Snape, as much as most people dislike him, was a very intelligent man and some of the writers make him stupid about all things muggle. My example fics of Another Snape meets the Dursley, has him cuting up the felttip of a marker to make it into a point so he could write with it.
