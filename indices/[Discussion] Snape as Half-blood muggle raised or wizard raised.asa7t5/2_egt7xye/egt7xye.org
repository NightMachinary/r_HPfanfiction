I don't think Snape was homeschooled, his father would likely want him in a "normal" school like all the other "normal" kids his age. I also think Snape would be well-versed in Muggle world, he did live there for a big portion of his life, and based on his memories, he probably didn't have any contact with the wizarding world except his mother before he went to Hogwarts. And just because he hated his father doesn't mean he hated everything Muggle. Although I can see him rejecting everything Muggle while he was trying to fit in with Death Eaters (though he still probably listened to some Muggle rock while brewing when nobody could hear).

Adult Snape also lived in his childhood house in a Muggle town or at least spent his summers there.

A lot of people seem to think that Snapes might not have owned a TV. Honest question, how likely is it for a poor family in England to not have it in the late 60s and 70s?
