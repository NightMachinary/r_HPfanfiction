Maybe some fics take it too far, but I think it's likely that Snape left the muggle world behind as much as possible after he entered Hogwarts. Growing up muggle did not create happy memories for him. While this won't leave him clueless about muggle society it does have the effect that he's basically clueless about the developments in the muggle world. The world changed rapidly between the 1970s and the end of the series and for someone who basically lives apart from that you can quickly lose feeling.
