Well, before it was revealed he was a half-blood and all, people just assumed he was pureblood because of how he acted and the little bits we did know about him. So a lot of older stuff will portray him as pureblood and quite ignorant, so if you pick up an older story to read, know it'll have some funny ideas that are essentially AU even if it doesn't say so.

Then there's just to consider he's probably quite out-of-the-loop with muggle stuff by the time Harry comes into the picture anyway. He did join Voldemort, after all. For that to happen, I imagine there had to be some major experiences with muggles and the muggle-world that ruined them all for him to agree that blue purity was a good thing.

I also kind of doubt he kept up-to-date with it after he joined up with the Death-Eaters and even after the war ended, he was still stuck in the magical world for 9-ish months out of the year because he was a Professor at Hogwarts. I also doubt he was all that interested in keeping up with the Muggles in those three-ish months he had off. He probably had other things he wanted/needed to do that pertain to his teaching career or just being a wizard in general.
