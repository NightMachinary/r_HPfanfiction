Digging for the Bones by Paganaidd - third year AU. Severitus fic.

Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood by cambangst - the trio have grandchildren and must face the threat of another dark lord and pure-blood supremacists on the rise. Murder mystery. The beginning is a bit confusing the first time reading it, but stick with it. It will become clear after about a third in.

Finally I can recommend pretty much anything by Iniga.

I really like The Bureaucratic Error where Remus Lupin is send back to the beginning of PoA. There are some big chunks of Tonks/Lupin there, but it is not the main focus of the fic.
