Lots and lots.

Like Dumbledore secret brother. We know that Dumbledore father was sent to Azkaban when Albus was young. But we have 18 year old young broher to Albus Dumbledore in FB1. It means his brother was born after Albus' father waz sent to jail.

Dumbledore teaching DADA instead of transfiguration.

Leta Lestrange was supposed to be last of her line but we have seen Lestrange family in HP books.

McGonagall in Ootp said she was teaching at Hogwarts for 39 years. That means from 1956. But she teaches Newt. That means around 1910.
