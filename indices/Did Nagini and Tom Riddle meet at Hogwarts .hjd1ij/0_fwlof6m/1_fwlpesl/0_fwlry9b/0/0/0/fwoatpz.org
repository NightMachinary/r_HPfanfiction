I never thought about the part he was teaching DADA instead of transfiguration, and was that Mcgonagall? I thought it another woman, isn't Mcgonagall the same age or younger than Newt? As in just a bit older than Tom and Hagrid?

IIRC Albus father got a 5 year sentence right? Even then, the age difference...

I had understood Leta was from another branch of that family, I mean, Bellatrix is a pretty big character in the books, they can't just have forgotten about her and her husband and brother in law.

Yeah, some pretty big plot holes and AFAIK it was written by JKR herself.
