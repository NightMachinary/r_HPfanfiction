I was honestly expecting you to have come across it before, because it's got pretty much everything you want: Gray!Harry, manipulative!Dumbledore, limited appearance of Ron and Hermione, Hogwarts' era, and it's complete and lengthy. And the writing is good enough that it kept me engaged despite not usually liking those tropes.
