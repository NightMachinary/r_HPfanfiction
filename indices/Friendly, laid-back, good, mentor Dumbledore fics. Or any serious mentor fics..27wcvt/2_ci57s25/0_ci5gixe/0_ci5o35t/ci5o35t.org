Pacing and tone are a little off. Could be a non-native issue, but a lot of words are subtly misused or are not in agreement. Unpolished. Seriously AU Harry.

As for content: an okay Dumbledore, at least at the start, but the author seems to occasionally lose what the focus of the story actually is. Lots of rather straight-forward powerful Harry. Strange and off-putting sexual imagery and dialog pops up out of nowhere sometimes, which is jarring -- and this is from me, someone who sometimes writes straight-up smut fics. Poor sense of new threats to meet the powerful new character of the writer's Harry Potter.

Overall, wasn't worth my time to finish, but it might just not be my thing.
