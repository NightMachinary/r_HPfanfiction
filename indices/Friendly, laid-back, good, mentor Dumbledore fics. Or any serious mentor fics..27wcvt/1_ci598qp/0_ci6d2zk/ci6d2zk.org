Runic Animagi is practically a crackfic, with Harry spending the first dozen or so chapters constantly mentioning all the weed, tattoos (magic and otherwise), powerful house-elf enchantments, and Muggle pussy he's getting. Oh yeah, and it is in first person. Practically a workshop on how not to do that, in fact. Lots of spelling and grammar errors, as well as oddly put together viewpoint shifts.

Not a lot of Dumbledore, though. He sort of shows up to apologize and tells Harry how awesome Harry is, I guess.

And again, super powerful Harry, for no reason. Maybe it gets better. I can't make it that far, if so. Readers beware.

Not one of my favorites, if that wasn't clear.
