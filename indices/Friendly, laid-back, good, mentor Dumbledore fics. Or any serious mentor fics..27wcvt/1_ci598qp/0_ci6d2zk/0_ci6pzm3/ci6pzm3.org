Yeah, I agree with you, it's a wish-fulfillment fic that only really works for the author and people who still think weed and swear words are the paragon of coolness.

Object Lessons wasn't much better, to be completely honest. It feels like reading the feelgood-y epilogue of a series of books, after all the action and challenge is over. There's no challenge or goal, just people talking about how happy they are.
