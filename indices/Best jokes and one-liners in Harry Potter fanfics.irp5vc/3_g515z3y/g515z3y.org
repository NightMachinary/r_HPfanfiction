Some of the humor in A Black Comedy hasn't aged entirely gracefully, but one line in particular still makes me giggle a bit:

"Fuck you all very much. And your mother twice."

And in a broader sense, the consistent use of the term "that fucker" to refer to the unknown person messing with Voldemort's plans.

More recently, although I sadly can't remember the fic and Google isn't helping despite the quote:

(In the context of Sirius talking to Narcissa.) "His accent seemed to have jumped up three tax brackets."
