From linkffn(13230340) Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay, when Harry asks what it means for Dumbledore being a Grand Sorcerer

#+begin_quote
  Harry tilted his head in anticipation, and Dumbledore winked at him before continuing. "One possibility is that it simply means that I am quite good at magic. While another is that it means I have created a Sorcerer's Stone."

  "What's a Sorcerer's Stone?" Harry asked.

  "I don't have the faintest idea," Dumbledore replied. "I believe that our cousins across the Atlantic may know, but I would not care to guess -- that is surely for them to tell."

When Harry is being defamed by Daily Prophet and asked Snape for wisdom

  "Professor McGonagall is correct," he said. "The Headmaster will doubtless be doing what he can in his own way. Aside from that, perhaps you could cancel your newspaper subscription?"

  "I don't have one," Harry replied.

  Professor Snape did the looking-at-Harry-carefully thing for about another thirty seconds. "You... don't have a subscription? Then what is the problem, boy?"

  "Well, Draco pointed it out to me," Harry explained. "And now Neville has a subscription to keep track of what's going on, and it all makes me really uncomfortable. I'd much rather graduate Hogwarts without being noticed much."

  ...

  "Subscribe to the Quibbler," Professor Snape told him bluntly. "Doubtless if you use that paper as your source of information you will soon forget all about this whole business."

When Dumbledore wants to celebrate

  He turned to Harry, and spoke more quietly. "After all that, I'm quite peckish. Shall we have some Muggle food to celebrate? I've heard good things about a Scottish chef not far from here."

  ...

  Harry took a bite out of his own McDonalds burger, not bothering to remove the wrapping first.

  "I think maybe the family was Scottish, originally, of the person who started it. But it's an American company," he told the much older wizard. "And there's loads of them, they're all over the place. I think they're supposed to be in half the countries in the world."

  "I believe I can see why," Dumbledore said. "It is really quite tasty, and prepared so quickly, and you can take it to eat anywhere. And they call it a happy meal, as well -- how very positive."

The fic is full of jokes like that, yet it's also wholesome.
