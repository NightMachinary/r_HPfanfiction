The same way anyone persuades a group to persecute others. Persuade them that they could lose what they have to them. Persuade them that they're less than human, maybe not even human at all. Persuade them that this 'enemy group' is a rot or a 'cancer' in their society, a threat to their values, their families, their stuff. That's how most bigotry begins and maintains.

I don't know if it was just a convenient excuse to round up Muggleborns or an actual sincerely held belief, but the Muggleborn Camp thing Umbridge was running supposedly held that Muggleborns were stealing magic. So, that doubles as Muggles being positioned as a threat to a Magical Person's identity, especially for Purebloods with all their 'magic blood is superior' nonsense.

Hell, could just be a mix of unchecked power and his personal authority. Check out the Stanford Prison Experiment, or the Milgram Shock Experiment, or the Asch Line Experiment. People will follow the crowd to fit in, will follow orders to the point of electrocuting a person to death. And give them unchecked power over others and they'll fall into barbarism in a matter of days. So, yeah. Voldemort comes in, says "I'm powerful, do what I say." and enough people obey that the rest of the Pureblood Social Group conforms too, then they get a taste of that power over others that violence and intimidation give, and fall further into it from there.

Plus, all that comes on top of their pre-existing beliefs as well. If they've always felt superior, or they've always felt hatred, or whatever else, they're more likely to accept a powerful person coming in and telling them that he'll lead them to victory, that they can finally do something about it.

And remember, it was a 'KKK' type thing as well as the civil war. They were framing muggles and muggleborns as the enemy while attacking the people in power so they could better do that. If you're a terrorist group, all you can really do is kill people and destroy things. If you're a government, you can control and regulate them too. So, destroying the government they see as enabling the Muggleborn Rot would get them more power and destroy something that isn't kowtowing to their beliefs.
