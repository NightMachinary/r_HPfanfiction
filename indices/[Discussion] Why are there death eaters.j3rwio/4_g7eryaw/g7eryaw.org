Because contrary to popular belief, *purebloods never held a significant amount of power in Wizarding Britain, nor were muggleborns always lower-class citizens.* The idea that pure-bloods run the wizarding world or that they hold a significant power base is complete fanon. The whole reason Voldemort had such a strong backing is because purebloods were always average wizards like halfbloods and muggleborns. *If purebloods had even a quarter of the institutional power that they do in fanon, they wouldn't have needed Voldemort in the first place.*

In fact, there wasn't actually any discrimination against muggleborns until the Death Eaters took over the Ministry by brute force in DH. They killed people like Amelia Bones and replaced them with Death Eaters, and put most of the Ministry under the Imperius Curse. The only people who weren't killed or replaced were the few who supported them (Umbridge and Runcorn), or those too weak to oppose them (Arthur, Cattermole, etc). As shown with Bones and Scrimgeour, the Death Eaters would just kill anyone who opposes them that can pose a threat. IIRC, Arthur was being monitored by the Ministry and the moment the Death Eaters confirmed Ron was travelling with Harry, he was forced to go into hiding.

Nothing suggests purebloods are richer than the average wizard, either. In fact, you can count the rich pure-blood families on one-hand: Malfoy, Black, Lestrange, Nott, and Potter. That's literally it, and even then, those families are so interrelated that its basically just one massive family tree. Again, the idea that pure-bloods are rich or more likely to be rich is nowhere in the books.

Meanwhile, look at all the purebloods who aren't rich: The Weasleys were working-class up until HBP/DH (post-DH, they became new money). The Gaunts were dirt poor to an extent that even the Weasleys look rich by comparison. The Crabbes and Goyles are both implied to be working-class since they're treated as Draco's inferiors and are below-average wizards. The Carrows are implied to be working-class due to their dialect (similar to Hagrid, Stan Shunpike, or Mundungus). Even the Prewitts were probably only upper-working class at best, or maybe lower-middle class---in other words, just average families. Not even Neville is shown to be from a rich family whatsoever, but just an ordinary family.

The idea that purebloods are more likely to be rich is born entirely from fanon's inability to realise that purebloods don't actually control the wizarding world. They forget that Hermione came from a solidly upper-middle class family, and to a much larger extent, so did Justin Finch-Fletchley---he was a muggleborn whose family was rich enough to put his name down for Eton. Why do people think muggleborns are going to be poor or merely average when there are many upper-middle class Muggle families in the UK? Muggleborns are just as likely to be middle-class as any other person in the UK.

They forget that the vast majority of wizards aren't purebloods at all since they have at least one parent or grandparent who is a non-wizard. Most of wizarding Britain (and thus the Ministry) would be mostly halfbloods. If I had to make a guess at the demographics of the wizarding world, I reckon they could be something like this: 65% halfbloods, 30% purebloods, and 5% muggleborns. I expect most wizards are halfbloods, muggleborns would be a very small minority, and purebloods would be a large minority since most wizards would have a Muggle parent or grandparent.

*TL;DR: Pureblood aren't any richer than the average wizard. There was no oppression against muggleborns until the Death Eaters took over the Ministry in DH with assassinations and the Imperius Curse---it all ended when Voldemort was killed. The only actual oppressed groups in the series were non-humans, part-human wizards, and Werewolves.*
