  *There was no oppression against muggleborns until the Death Eaters took over the Ministry in DH with assassinations and the Imperius Curse---it all ended when Voldemort was killed. The only actual oppressed groups in the series were non-humans, part-human wizards, and Werewolves.*

I really do not agree with that. The oppression against non-humans, part-human wizards and Werewolves was written in the law but that doesn't mean that oppression against muggleborns didn't exist.

There was only one Muggleborn Minister of Magic and he was forced to leave the office. I think it's similar to People of Colour in the real world. In most countries there aren't any longer laws that oppress PoC but that doesn't mean there isn't any oppression left: Police violence is a much bigger problem for black people than for white people, PoC are more likley to live in poverty, held less seats in politics etc...
