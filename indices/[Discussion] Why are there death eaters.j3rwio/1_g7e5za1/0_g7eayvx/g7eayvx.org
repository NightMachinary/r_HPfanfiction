  and I don't remember anything about the Notts or the Parkinsons or basically any Death Eater families except Blacks/Malfoys being wealthy or powerful.

In an interview, Rowling said that she had worked on a scene where Draco was talking with Theodore where, where she wanted to show how he interacted with his "perceived equals". So even if she dropped this idea in the end, we can at least gather that the Nott were though as a wealthy/ influencial family.

  * though I wonder how many people knew about Voldemort's origins, even among the original Death Eaters. I mean, before founding the DEs he pretty much dropped off the radar for a decade or so, and then showed up with a new name and changed appearance.

During both the Blood Wars, Tom Riddle being behind the name of Voldemort was pretty much an open secret. The run-of-the-mill Witch or Wizard (like some Ministry Worker or a Snatcher) may not know about it, but the information was know by absolutely everyone "who mattered".\\
In GoF, Voldemort has no problem talking about his "Muggle father" in front of the Death Eater, and since the "original crew" is thought to have followed him since school, they probably knew about this.

Nobody ever tried to use this information against him because it would be useless. It's not like knowing his identity would uncover any weakness (his only connections to the Muggle world were a manor he left in ruin and an orphanage he hated), and, unlike you are Dumbledore, talking about it would just greatly increase your chance of dying a violent death in the following night.
