  I don't think there is much doubt that the purebloods a always held a significant amount of power in Wizarding Britain, and muggleborns were always lower-class citizens, in practice of not legally.

Do we really know this, though? I mean, sure there were rich and powerful pureblood families like the Blacks or the Malfoys, but there were also families like the Gaunts - and I don't remember anything about the Notts or the Parkinsons or basically any Death Eater families except Blacks/Malfoys being wealthy or powerful. In fact, I believe that equating pureblood families with aristocracy is mostly a fandom invention.

(People sometimes bring up things like the Sacred 28, but it was in fact an /anonymously published political pamphlet/, not any sort of a nobility list or a social register)

In fact, I think this might be a good explanation: even if the purebloods held any power, by the time of Voldemort's rise to power it had already begun to wane, and many people joined him because of fear of losing what little influence they had, or a wish to "reclaim" their "rightful place" in society.

So, the majority of those who became Death Eaters were probably not too rich or powerful, but they thought that they deserved to be, and were even willing to follow a half-blood orphan if it gets them what they want*.

Oh, and the really rich purebloods who followed him probably intended to use him in order to cement their control over the Magical Britain, and stop those annoying reformers with ridiculous ideas such as "maybe we should pass some legislation about all this Dark magic stuff?" or "how about we don't discriminate against wizards** on the basis of something they had no control over?"

Of course, we all know how that worked out.

* though I wonder how many people knew about Voldemort's origins, even among the original Death Eaters. I mean, before founding the DEs he pretty much dropped off the radar for a decade or so, and then showed up with a new name and changed appearance.

** not discriminating against Muggles or Magical creatures seems to be way too progressive for just about everyone in the Wizarding world.
