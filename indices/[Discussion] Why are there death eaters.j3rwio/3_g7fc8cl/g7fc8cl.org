Being a Death Eater comes with a really high risk of injury, death or imprisonment. Why would people do it? Yes those who want to hurt others, I can see that, but I've often thought that people like Lucius Malfoy - who probably thinks he's a pretty important person - haven't enough reason to seek out a subservient role to another wizard. Easier to move abroad and keep a low profile far away if they think V is a genuine threat.
