It would be hilarious if Harry still has his "saving people thing" and tries to coach Lavender, somehow ending up as her Yule Ball date along the way (after watching her fail spectacularly at dodging exercises, Hermione jokingly suggests that he should try teaching her how to dance for footwork and things go their natural way from there on).

Hardcore fan Harry (complete with scarf, No1 glove and Team Lavender T-shirt/hoody) would be another fun way to add even more comedy to that story.
