Imagine the name piece coming out of the Goblet, Dumbledore starts reading "Harry..." and turns the snipped around only to stare at it for like five minutes and everyone is wondering what the hell is going on. Ron already has his accusing stare directed at Harry when Dumbledore quietly reads "Lavender Brown" before reaching into his golden counter (from the movies) and pulls out a shot of Firewhiskey while everyone is like "what did he say?"

Also, please don't turn that into outright Hermione bashing. It would be a lot more fun to have her torn between "protective big sister" who wants the best for Harry, therefore thinking that he could do better than the girl she has not had the best interactions with and supporting Harry in his half pathetic, half adorable attempts at wooing her. Maybe throw in some reconciliation prior to the Yule Ball where Hermione comes to Lav begging for help and Lav is like "you need to slay another dragon? Because that's boring and I was hoping to tame the next one I see." and Hermione only replies "I need help taming my hair".
