Is she not helping because she's jealous or because she thinks that Harry is ridiculous about it (honestly, just ask her out, no need for that "save people" spiel)?

Because I feel that the second one would fit far better into a comedic narrative. Hermione constantly egging Harry to just go for it while he is like "I'm just trying to be nice here".
