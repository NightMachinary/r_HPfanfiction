I'm glad to help. The overall premise can be the foundation of so many hilarious situations, from Hermione walking in on Harry and Lav snogging, Lav dreading a lecture only for Hermione to hug Harry and say "told you so" up to Hermione writing a mission log (Day 43, Mission accomplished: Harry finally got his head out of his arse, found him snogging Lavender in the common room. Unrelated note, where do I find another parselmouth? The sounds Lav made make me think that I'm missing out on something really good.)
