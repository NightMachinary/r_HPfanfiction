Oh, no, it's just Harry feeling responsible for Lavender's entry ("In all honesty this was probably a plot against me gone wrong, so...") and helping her, Hermione thinking its some misguided attempt to woo Lavender and as such specifically not helping, Lavender being confused and scared, and Dumbledore trying to keep the tasks as un-deadly as he can.

And then it becomes Hermione and Harry staring in horrified awe as Lavender /destroys/ the competition.
