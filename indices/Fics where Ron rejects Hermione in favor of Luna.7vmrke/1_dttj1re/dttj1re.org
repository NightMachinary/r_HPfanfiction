I think this subreddit is relatively open about Ron, except for a few really aggressive basher, heck there were quite a few threads with people being annoyed with the bashing. About how Hermione would react, it would depend if they´re already together or not, if he breaks up with her to be with Luna, I guess Hermione would be angry, but considering what they went through together, I guess they could fix things and remain friends after a while. Harry in this case will probably be on Hermione´s "side" or just try amend things between the two. If they´re not together and Luna ends up with Ron, she´ll probably be miffed for a while, if we say it happens in year six like with Lavender, but considering she likes Luna, I guess she would just accept it and move on. About stories with them I only remember reading about the pairing as a side pairing, but not as main story.
