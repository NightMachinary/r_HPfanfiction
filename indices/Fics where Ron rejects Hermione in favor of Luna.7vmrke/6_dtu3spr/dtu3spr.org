I always feel bad for Luna when I read stories like that. She deserves better. It can work though if Ron is more proactive and helps her out in some way, Harry seems way to busy and Luna could really need some friends earlier than in canon. Would be good for Ron too if he defines himself less through his friendship to Harry and starts to stand on his own 2 feet.

I can't provide you with a story, but I think on Portkey Ron/Luna was a popular (the only allowed maybe?!) Ron pairing, so maybe look for some stories from there.

Anyway, the only ship that makes sense for canon!Ron is someone equally superficial and emotionally stunted, maybe Lavender... but I felt bad even for her. She seemed really care about the guy - in her own Ahnung way - and he treated her like a practice girlfriend and someone to make out with.
