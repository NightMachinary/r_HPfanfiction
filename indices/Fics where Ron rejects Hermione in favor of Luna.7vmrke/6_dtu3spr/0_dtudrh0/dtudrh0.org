Ron is superficial? I'm sorry, maybe we didn't read the same books or maybe you just saw the movies. But the Ron I remember, went through a forest infest with spiders, his greatest fears, so that he wouldnt let his friend alone. He sacrificied himself in a game of chess, which could have provoked his death when he was ELEVEN years old? Tell me, what did you do when you were eleven?
