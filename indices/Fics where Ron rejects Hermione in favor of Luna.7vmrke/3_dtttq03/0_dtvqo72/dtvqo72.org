I quite like the portrayal of Ron in linkffn(Chessmaster: Black Pawn) and the sequel linkffn(Chessmaster: White Knight) by [[/u/Flye_Autumne][u/Flye_Autumne]]. It's quite AU and focuses on politics, but Ron worked hard growing up and isn't lazy. He's intelligent, driven but still retains his original positive features like his humour.
