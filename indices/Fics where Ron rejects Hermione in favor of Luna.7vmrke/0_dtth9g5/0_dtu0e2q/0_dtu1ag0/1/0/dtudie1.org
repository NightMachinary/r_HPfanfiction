Hermione admited that she needed a few hours, a lot of bottle of something to make her look so pretty. With magic, 4 hours and a ton of beauty product, you can make an animal look sexy. And if the ONLY reference about one of the thee main character's beauty is less than a page... Then it means that she either isn't beautiful or ugly. Don't you remember that she is always described as big front teeth and extremly bushy hair?
