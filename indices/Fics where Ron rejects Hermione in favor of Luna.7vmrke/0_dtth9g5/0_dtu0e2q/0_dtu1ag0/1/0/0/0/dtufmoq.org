She may had her teeth fixed, but she still had those teeth for 3/4 books. I'm sure that Hermione is the only one who had to use a huge amount of the hair product, she even said herself that it was too much trouble to use it everyday. While it doesn't mean that she is ugly, it does mean that she is less than average. "The attention to her appearance was unusual". Finally it's normal that Cormac would be interested in her because she is somewhat popular in Hogwarts due to her friendship with Harry and the DM fights from the fifth year. Besides nothing says that Cormac has big standard.

Edit: If you look like Hermione, I hope you will not take it personal as your constant downvotes of my replies may indicate...
