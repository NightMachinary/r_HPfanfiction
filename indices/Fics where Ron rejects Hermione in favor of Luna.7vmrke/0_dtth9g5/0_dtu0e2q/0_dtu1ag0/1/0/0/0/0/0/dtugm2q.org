No my point is that Hermione can only look attractive when she spend a lot of time on her appearance. My point is that everyone can look attractive if you give them magic and an entire day. My point is that Hermione, in her daily appearance, isn't attractive. She is less than average. And, please do read the books because it was nowhere written that Harry is very attractive. Hell, Rowling wanted to replace Daniel Radcliffe because she thought him to good looking and wanted someone average.
