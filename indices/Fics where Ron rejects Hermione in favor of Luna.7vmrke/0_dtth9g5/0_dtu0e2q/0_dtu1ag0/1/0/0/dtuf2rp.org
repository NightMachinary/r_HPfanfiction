Almost every girl spent at least a few hours getting ready for the Yule Ball, and would for any major event.

Also, Cormac McLaggen was interested in Hermione in Half-blood Prince and he wouldn't be interested if she wasn't at least passingly attractive. That doesn't mean she's a model or Emma Watson level, but calling her less than average or ugly is blatantly false.
