It's almost like you stopped reading at the end of Prisoner of Azkaban. Your comments make a lot more sense with that lens. I'd agree that both Harry (malnutrition) and Hermione (pre-puberty) were likely unattractive children, but that's clearly not the case from GoF on.

  “Oh, come on, Harry,” said Hermione, suddenly impatient. “It's not Quidditch that's popular, it's you! You've never been more interesting, and frankly, you've never been more fanciable.”

  Ron gagged on a large piece of kipper.

Note that interesting is presented separately than fanciable.

And Romilda Vane and all of her friends, the whole bit about the Hippogriff tattoo. Harry also looks like his father, who was described as handsome. Rowling herself has said that Harry inherited his parents good looks, and Lily was also described as attractive. Even Tom Riddle, who hates him, says they have similarities in looks^{^{1}} and Tom was described to be attractive himself.

If you want to ignore sections of the books to fit your preferred view, I guess I'll have to leave you to it. If you come across anything supporting either Harry or Hermione as less than average, please do send a quote.
