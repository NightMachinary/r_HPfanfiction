So your point is that Hermione is unattractive because she prefers to spend her time on things other than her appearance?

People can be cute without any help at all. I mean, Harry himself is described as very attractive and he spends exactly zero time on himself. To equate "I'd rather not spend time taming my hair daily" to "unattractive all over" seems like a desperate stretch.
