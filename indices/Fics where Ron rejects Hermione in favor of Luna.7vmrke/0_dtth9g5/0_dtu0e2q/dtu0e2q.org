It's quite common as background pairing but makes no sense to me. Usually, it goes along the lines of Ron letting Luna just prattle on about whatever she believes in and that is the extent of their "relationship". I mean, I don't particularly like Ron, but I could totally see him going for the "hot" girls like Lavender or Parvati (or if we go with fanon Susan, Hannah or occasionally Daphne) instead of the ones who are somewhat academic and would be not very compatible with him. Sadly, writing a relationship which BEGAN purely based on looks makes it "shallow", despite being a common occurrence in the real world.

Edit for clarification: From all the Ron/Luna relationships I have seen, none seem to be a remotely healthy relationship. I mean, if one partner just pretty much ignores the other when they are talking about their lifelong passion, that seems very odd to me. And not particularly long-lived, but the author usually brushes this over with the ol' "but they still love each other" despite never showing it in their interactions. Ron in canon seems to go for the pretty girls (GoF anyone?). Absolutely nothing wrong with that. It just seems odd that someone that uninterested in academic pursuits would go for either the "smartest witch in her generation" or for "Britain's leading cryptozoologist".
