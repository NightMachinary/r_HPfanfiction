You know, I never really considered this pairing but I really find myself liking it. Luna in canon actually finds Ron very funny, so much so that she explicitly tells him so. Luna is the type that seemingly would be hard to humor since she is not great at sarcasm, so I feel this is significant.

Additionally, I find myself really intrigued by how Hermione would react to them being together, based on how she treats/feels about Luna. I would absolutely read a fic like this.
