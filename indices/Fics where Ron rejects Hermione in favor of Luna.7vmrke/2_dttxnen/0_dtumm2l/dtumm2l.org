Ron remarked that Luna was "interesting" and "good value", so I think he was intrigued enough by her that he might have fallen in love with her if he hadn't already developed feelings for Hermione.

Based on what we know about Rolf Scamander, it would seem that Luna has an affinity for redheads, which kind of sinks my Harry/Luna ship that I've had for many years.
