Here's the thing though, there are no laws governing science (except the scientific method, which has no reason to not apply to magic). Science is, by itself, the process of discovering the laws that govern the universe.

Magic still has rules, all it means is that instead of using the usual laws (gravity, electromagnetism, etc., etc.) you have to figure out new laws. I'm all for experimenting with spells you just have to throw your preconceptions of how things should work at the door.

(That said, even studying the interface of such areas do seem like a fascinating area of study: can you generate free energy using the Levitation Charm? Why doesn't 'artificial' electrical things work near magical concentrations but 'natural' electrical things do? If you had say, a spell that generated an electrical current, could you use it to power a circuit that'd work around magic?)

I love fiction works in general that will try to 'explain' magic and by that I mean not within a physical framework, but make a set of internal, well defined rules and if you prefer fiction works that just go "This is magic. No questioning allowed" that's fine, everybody has different tastes.

This is part of the reason HPMoR grew to become quite annoying to me - even though it pretends to be a science-y story after a while he barely experiments anymore, he just thinks about the answer really hard and he's right. All while using a ton of scientific jargon.

tl;dr: Experimenting: Yay!, Trying to pidgeonhole magic within the rules of physics / chemistry / whatever: Meh.
