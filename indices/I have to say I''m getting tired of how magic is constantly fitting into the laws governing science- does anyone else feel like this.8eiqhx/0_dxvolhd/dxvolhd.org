Science isn't just about physics. Hogwarts in itself is pretty scientific... The scientific method is about finding the laws/rules of how things work, by the model of hypothesis->experiment->(repeat x1000) -> theory.

Magic clearly follows some rules and logic or it would be completely arbitrary and random (no need to have a school or to come up with things like "Gamp's Law").

Common Witches and Wizards just don't seem to ask any of the important "why?" or "how?" questions in the books, it is all relegated to a handful of Unspeakables. The HP world sometimes reminds me of the times of Newton and others, when you could make a huge impact and research gains by just rigorously applying the scientific method. Back then you had people who were active in many fields at once, because they saw a problem and had an idea how to tackle it (completely out of the question nowadays, the obvious questions are already all answered or at least have been asked by someone much smarter than us). I sometimes feel the same with magic: The amount of hypothesis and experiments I'd like to perform on polyjuice alone is staggering.
