Couterpoint to the not asking questions thing. How many people can tell you how their car works? What about their phone, hell most people have no idea how their toilet works.

I consider myself pretty handy but i cant tell you why the alternator works just that i can install a new one. Hell even though i know how a engine works as a concept i have no idea what kind of tolerances it requires. How much pressure is the engine block under and how does the fact it gets hot change that?

Most people dont know and dont care because its to much of a hassle. As long as i pour the dinosaur juice in and change the oil once in a while my horseless carriage gets me to and from work and that is all most people care about..
