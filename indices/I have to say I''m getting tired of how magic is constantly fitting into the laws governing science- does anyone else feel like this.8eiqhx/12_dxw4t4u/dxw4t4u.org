The only time I apply actual science to Harry Potter is in genetics. I like to compare the magic gene to hemophilia (conceptually; it's not a point-to-point comparison). Thus most Muggleborns and Squibs can be traced back to an ancestor that's probably within the last three generations. Only in very rare cases is there a mutation that causes a Muggleborn or Squib.

Otherwise, as someone else said, the magic of Harry Potter is that it's /magic/. You can use the scientific method (make an observation and then experiment until you have enough evidence for a theory), but I don't recommend trying to apply physics to a world that exists outside of it. The soft magic system that Rowling developed allows it to be flexible, with almost anything possible.
