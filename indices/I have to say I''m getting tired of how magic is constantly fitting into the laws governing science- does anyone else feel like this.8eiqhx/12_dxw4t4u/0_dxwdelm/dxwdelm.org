According to Brandon Sanderson, Rowling magic system falls in the middle of the spectrum between soft magic (Lord of the Rings, wher the magic is there, but it's this nebulous part of the world rather than anything quantifiable.) and hard magic (such as Mistborn, where the effects of magic are well documented, as are the mechanics, with each metal burned producing a different effect.)
