Magic is not quantitative or reducible to muggle physics/chemistry/biology. How do you measure the amount of hatred required to cast a Cruciatus, or the amount of motherly love required for sacrificial protective magic to work?

A much better analogy for magic is Aristotelian physics - descriptive, qualitative, non-mathematical. In Aristole's system, rocks tend towards the earth because that's their natural place. Planets orbit in a circular motion because circles are the most perfect form of movement, existing in the eternal heavenly spheres etc. I've always felt that magical "science" could be worked out in an interesting way by modifying ancient and medieval natural philosophy, using human emotions as forces and so on. How about if major philosophers were squibs trying to figure out how things worked? Sadly, people want to square it with contemporary muggle science and make it boring.
