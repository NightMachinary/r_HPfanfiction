I'm not super-annoyed by it. I feel more like magic without any limitations at all is boring. If there were absolutely no limits on magic, then what would be the point? Where's the struggle and the conflict? If there are no limits on magic, why are the Weasleys poor? Why do they have to use money for anything at all? Why do kids have to take a train to school? How inconvenient for Seamus's family who would have to travel all the way from Ireland to London just so he could go all the way up north to Scotland. Apparently there's some sort of limitations because the Weasleys have to use Ministry cars to get their brood to Kings Cross. Why don't they just side-along Apparate all of the kids and the gear?

Because if they did that, then we don't have the delightful scenes of an utterly bewildered Harry watching people run headlong at what looks like a solid brick wall and having to take his first leap of faith that magic works and he belongs in the magical world. We are not wizards, we are Muggles and we don't understand magic, but we do understand how physics works, so when Muggles like us write stories about magical things, we use limits and concepts that make sense to us. Otherwise, every story would be as such:

Harry Potter woke up and conjured up breakfast. Then he waved his wand and solved poverty, hunger and created a lasting world peace. Then he had a nap. The end.
