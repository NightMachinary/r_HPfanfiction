There's two schools of magic: the mysterious/mystical, and the super scientific. Tons of very legitimate writers are in both camps. Some examples are Lord of the Rings' and Star Wars for the first camp and Mistborn and Avatar for the second.

This sub tends to be super in the first camp. My personal opinion is that because the magic system in Harry Potter isn't super well defined, most hard-core fans of the series are people who like this kind of magic system.

I'm actually in the other camp and I love well-defined super strict magic. I know I'm in the minority here, but the magic system of Harry Potter was probably one of the biggest things I disliked about the series. It's also why some of my favourite series (Avatar, Fullmetal Alchemist, Mistborn) have very well-defined ones.
