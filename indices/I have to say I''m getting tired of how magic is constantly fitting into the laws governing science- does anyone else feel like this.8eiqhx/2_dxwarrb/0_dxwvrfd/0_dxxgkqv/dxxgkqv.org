You might be into linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). It's not super hard, but one of the things it attempts to do is make canon logically consistent.

Tons of things that don't make any sense in canon (why are the weasley's poor? why is making a horcrux so evil? how is Hagrid half giant if giants are 10x the size of people?) are explained. It isn't as hard as say Mistborn, but the author explores the myth and origins of magic a lot more.

Definitely a recommendation. Only caveat is year 1 sucks, but the rest makes up for it.
