This is it exactly. It's also sometimes called "hard magic systems" and "soft magic systems." like hard and soft sci-fi referring to how rigidly the author adheres to the laws of the universe as we know them.

But it's less about science and more about whether the reader can predict it. Harry using an older spell in an unusual and creative way is hard magic. Harry learning a new spell that works because the book says so is soft magic.

Id love to read some actual hard magic hp fanfiction but it's rarely done well.
