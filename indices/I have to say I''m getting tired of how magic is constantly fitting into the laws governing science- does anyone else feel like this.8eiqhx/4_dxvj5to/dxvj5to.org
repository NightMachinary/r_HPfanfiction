No, you're not the only one. [[/u/Taure]]'s magical systems generally rely not on science, and for my current story I even plan magic to be impossible to quantify, but easy to qualify.

Sadly, there are not that many fics that dive into these aspects of magic. The Arithmancer for example annoys me with this. It's not photons at a certain wavelength that kill you, it's the basiliks' stare.

There are a few fics that do it differently, though.

In linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes) magic is more concept-based. In linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure) Taure also delves into the magical system a bit. I don't recall more at the moment - if I find more, I'll edit it in.
