  Sadly, there are not that many fics that dive into these aspects of magic. The Arithmancer for example annoys me with this. It's not photons at a certain wavelength that kill you, it's the basiliks' stare.

No, it has to be the seeing of the basilisk's stare. Otherwise, mirrors and cameras wouldn't make a difference. That the stare could be blocked by glasses that "censor" the basilisk's eyes out of the picture---by whatever means---is a reasonable corollary.
