Totally agree with you on this - I read The Arithmancer because I thought the premise sounded interesting... and then Hermione turns into this super chemist/scientist who solves all of magic's problems. The basilisk is a good example, but then later she also starts manufacturing diamonds and turns this into a little side business. Her talking about photons and atoms takes all the magic out of magic.

Think I finally gave up on the story when she decided to manufacture herself a sword, got Nearly Headless Nick to teach her how to use it and then started walking around Hogsmeade with it strapped to her waist for no reason and absolutely no other character seemed to find this odd.
