If you give magic arbitrary pseudo-physical explanation, that's no better than giving arbitrary fully magical explanation. In fact as you can't make magic similar to the one in HP work with physics properly it's in fact even more arbitrary and less intuitive.

Actually at moments like that I wonder if you (and other people in similar cases) ever read any other fantasy than HP? More-or-less conceptual magic is pretty standard thing, even in xianxia (to say in HP fic terms, Chinese stories about making your magical core bigger) you have stuff like "the lotus sword formation channels the concept of lotus so I will sit and analyse lotuses to make it more powerful", or "I will use powerful magical things that represent the five elements to create five elemental magical tatoos to use them to bring myself to the next powerlevel", or "Now that I learned magical technique which was only partially preserved I can use my understanding of other techniques rooted in the same theory to fill the blanks". And that's one of the most popular webnovels in the genre (I Shall Seal the Heaven for those interested, though I don't recommend it, it falls apart later on). Clearly, people are able to understand things that aren't pseudo-physic.
