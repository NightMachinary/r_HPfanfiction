I'd guess that it's because "It's magic, physics don't need to apply" and "it's conceptual" can render conflicts dull. Let's say we have "a Shield Charm protects. It's not a physical force - it's the concept of protection wrapped around the target". First, you have to decide what happens when someone sends a curse at someone under the shield charm's protection. We know the Unforgiveables don't care about the Shield Charm, and that Stunners and other curses do. But what happens to a gas attack? What happens if you start to remove all Oxygen in the room? What about falling damage? What about a landslide? Heat? Stench? How far does the concept of protection go? It doesn't protect against a basilisk's gaze, and a Nundu wouldn't be feared if a Protection Charm could stop its breath. But lesser versions of those attacks?

You have to make up a lot of decisions. But the real problem is that even if you do make all those decisions, they are usually not intuitive for everyone. Some readers will simply feel that you're arbitrally deciding what works and what doesn't work against a Shield Charm to suit your story. Unless you fill the story with a detailed analysis of the Shield Charm - which other readers might consider "wall of text" or "A Chekov Cannon".

On the other hand, if a Shield Charm is a physical semi-permeable barrier like Star Trek shields or even a medieval shield, you might have an easier time to make the readers understand and follow along in a fight as it deflects some attacks, but not others.

It's simply harder to get caught up in a battle where it's basically "my concept versus yours", instead of when spells are pitted against each other that have more defined and more intuitive limits. Turning the air around the enemy into poison gas forcing them to cast a Bubble-Head Spell or use a wind blast to disperse it is more colourful than having them counter it with yet another Shield Charm, just as they did to the wall of fire and the landslide.

Further, even if you assume that magic can do anything, that doesn't mean that its effects are also unlimited. If you conjure a wall of fire, does that consume oxygen as it burns? Does it emit heat in all directions? Does it come with a built-in "protect the caster from fire" effect? Does that work against fires started by the spell? What happens if you conjure a magical fire, and then turn the air around it into pure oxygen?

Basically, if magic can do anything without any care about physics (including its consequences, effects), it might end up too boring. So you add such limits. And then you might start extrapolating, and soon you're erring in the other extreme - turning magic into a wand-operated replicator from Star Trek.

The trick is finding a balance between too much and not enough "It's magic, kid".
