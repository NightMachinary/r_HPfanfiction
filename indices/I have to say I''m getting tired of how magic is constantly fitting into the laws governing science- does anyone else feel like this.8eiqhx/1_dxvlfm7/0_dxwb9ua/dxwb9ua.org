  ou have to make up a lot of decisions. But the real problem is that even if you do make all those decisions, they are usually not intuitive for everyone. Some readers will simply feel that you're arbitrally deciding what works and what doesn't work against a Shield Charm to suit your story. Unless you fill the story with a detailed analysis of the Shield Charm - which other readers might consider "wall of text" or "A Chekov Cannon".

To add to this, if your reader understands a spell/magic super well, it lets you play around with it in ways that make the reader go "wow, that's clever and well thought-out". A good example of this is Harry's scar and the horcrux connection. Harry and Voldemort's connection is well described through the series, Voldemort can possess Nagini and Harry both, the wand cores, etc.

And that's because Horcruxes are probably one of the most in-depth types of magic we learn about. The more you explain magic, the more cool moments you get like that.

Imo the right balance is when a few clever readers will be able to figure out solutions to the characters' problems with the tools you've given them, but not everyone can. An example where this didn't happen was literally every time Harry fights Voldemort and wins on luck alone. Imo something HPMOR did well is that the end (how Harry beats Voldemort) is something you totally could've seen coming and put together yourself, but it's clever enough that most people (me included) didn't.
