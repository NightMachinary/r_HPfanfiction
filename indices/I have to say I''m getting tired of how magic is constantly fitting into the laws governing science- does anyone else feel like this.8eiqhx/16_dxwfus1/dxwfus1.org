To me it's a matter of degree. And, in a way, of execution perhaps.

I'm not particularly bothered if a character with a better grasp of physics figures out how to apply magic in innovative ways. Because magic or no magic physics still apply in the world, if not in the magic.

Someone mentioned The Arithmancer and Hermione's dealing with the Basilisk. From what I recall she made it so that she couldn't actually see its eyes by wearing those glasses. In a way, it's like she was blindfolded, except the blindfold only prevented her to see ther basilisk's eyes (and possibly other items of the same colour, I suppose). Whatever mystical and magical force is behind the basilisk killing stare, she's no more seeing its eyes than someone hiding behind a wall.

Another interesting thing was in HPMOR (yes I know most people seem to hate that fic in this subreddit but bear with me). In it people couldn't transfigure parts of items, only the whole. Whereas Harry figured out it was just a problem of conceptualizing. Since matter is made of atoms and whatnot.

So yeah, I find it mostly ok, unless it becomes just too much. Although I personally stil like better when magic is more volubile (?) and intangible than this.
