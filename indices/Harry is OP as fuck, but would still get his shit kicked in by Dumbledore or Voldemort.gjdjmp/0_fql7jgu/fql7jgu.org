The narrative problem here is if every major character is more powerful, then no-one actually is - so there's very little point to simply making everyone more powerful for the sake of it.

That means there's not a lot of fanfics I can think of where all 3 major parties more powerful - and the few I can think of all have Dumbledore-Bashing to the max in order to force Harry to fight a war on multiple fronts.

The only non-bashing example I can think of is Accidental Animagus: linkao3(14078862)
