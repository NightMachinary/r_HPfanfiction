The only one I can think of where that's the case - at least for a while - is in linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) and its sequels. It's a Dresden Files crossover, though I had no problem understanding it without having read that series at all.

In it, Harry is powered up severely, but is also presented as a good bit weaker than Dumbledore for most of the series. The fic also includes some pretty interesting magical additions for Dumbledore, which I really enjoy.
