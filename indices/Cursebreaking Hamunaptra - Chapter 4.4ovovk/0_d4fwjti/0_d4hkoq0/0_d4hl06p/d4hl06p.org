Well, my body is definitely ready for any and all future updates to this story. There's something about this fic that makes me think waaaaaaaaaaay back to when I was about 7 years old, reading PS/SS for the first time. Whimsical, yet serious. The magic feels organic, the prose does what it is meant to nearly perfectly.

[[/spoiler][I can't fucking wait to see what is going to happen in Hamunaptra, and how the fact that Bill is a wizard instead of a muggle French Foreign Legion veteran changes how Ardeth Bay handles everything.]]
