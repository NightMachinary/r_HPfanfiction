I try to plot everything out, at least roughly, then I just start chugging out chapters. But I have a pretty good psyche profile of every character in my head to make sure every action they take is character appropriate, saves lots of time figuring out where to take the story next.

Pretty much, I put the characters in a situation and start writing what THEY Decide to do. I don't write so much as record whats going on in my head.

Problem is, when the story just stops flowing, or the characters don't want to do anything. We all just give up and browse netflix or reddit instead.
