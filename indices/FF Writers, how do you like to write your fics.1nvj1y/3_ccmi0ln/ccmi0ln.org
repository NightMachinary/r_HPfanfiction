I tend to write notes down by hand first. I will do a summary, once I'm inspired, and create the characters from there. I've been into post-war stuff, so I usually try to figure out what everyone is doing, who they're doing, and so on and so forth. Which means that I create character outlines.

Then I might do point-form summaries of chapters. If I have a quote or an idea that suddenly spawns, I always write it down.

Once I've done that, I need a quiet space to write. I feel that creating a mood is important to an extent because it will affect your writing. So I tend to play music that creates the mood I want to write and then write. I always read over stuff, make sure I'm happy, edit a bit, and then it's done.

I always remind myself that it's okay to go a little off /away from the outline so long as the story flows and makes sense. I also always tell my readers to add constructive criticism if they want. That way I can see what they're seeing, and getting into the minds of the readers is very important. I don't get betas because when I want to post, I want to post. I don't want to wait on someone else to finish editing my work. There are those who might disagree, and I totally understand. I just don't like having a beta, especially since I always go back and edit.

So yeah...outlines are handwritten, betas not wanted, and I like to set a certain mood using music. I find that, so far, it has worked well. Fanfiction is meant to be fun, a creative way for people to share their work/ideas. Which means that I like to have fun when I write.

So the most important thing is that you enjoy the process. Because if you don't, it feels forced and won't be as beautiful as it could be.
