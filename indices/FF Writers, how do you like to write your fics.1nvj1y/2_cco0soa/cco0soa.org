*My Origin Story*

I got started in creative writing by throwing myself in the deep end during NaNoWriMo 2011. I just wrote 1700 words a day, no (few) excuses, and mandatory catch up if I did slack. And I made it, over 50k words in a month. I didn't plot ahead for that, didn't write it sequentially, and didn't have more than a vague idea what I was doing when I started. I also didn't end up with a complete novel, just 80% of the barest bones of one, but it was a heady experience. I was hooked.

After that, I took what I wrote during the NaNoWriMo and put it in a folder so I wouldn't have to look at it anymore. I have hardly touched it since. It wasn't very well written. I may do a rewrite someday, as I still kind of like that idea.

--------------

*Storage*

Now, working on three active fanfics (I am stupid), I have set up a writing directory and a folder for each story, containing:

- one Open Document (.odt) file for a calendar slash timeline (both written and planned)

- one file for notes on the plot of the story and things I want to write

- one file for notes on what I've already written, in summary format per chapter

- one plain text file just containing notes on things I need to fix, listed per chapter with copy-pasted references to the surrounding text (this is VERY important) and maybe /very/ short notes on what to fix. Making the process of creating these notes as painless as possible is /critical/. I collect these notes while proof reading my chapter during my NON-writing time. It is very important to my process not to get bogged down while proofing, just to push on through and fix things later. I then usually just reread that section and see the problem immediately.

- and finally, one ODT file for each chapter of that story, labeled with the name of the story (in case the files go rogue somehow) and the chapter number. I add stuff to the end when I make a major revision or take a major action, something like "_v.3" or "_PUBLISHED". Yes this screws with my software versioning system. Shutup.

The top level writing directory is also a [[https://www.dropbox.com/][Dropbox]] folder. I am an insane programmer in real life, so I also have them version controlled with Subversion. I keep the SVN repository folder in another location, an Amazon Cloud Drive folder. As I previous stated: insane. But that means I can restore previous versions of files even if every HDD I own blows up at the same time and if one of two major international companies decides to delete all my files. Also at the same time. Not just belt and suspenders, but also some kind of genital piercing holding up my pants.

In this analogy, that is. I don't have those in real life. Except for the belt, and only sometimes.

--------------

*Plotting*

I'd like to say I plot everything in advance with detailed notes. But mostly, I have a vague outline (sometimes mostly in my head) for the main plot points in the fic and more detailed stuff for the next few chapters. I usually take notes of important "beat" points, cool things I want to do or thematic points I need to hit in the plot at just the right time. Sometimes, I write those scenes ahead of time and slot them in (after heavy editing) when I get there in the published story.

When I try to plan ahead on chapter layout and content and such, I almost always end up changing it when I actually get there and start writing. This means I mostly do a plot-as-I-go thing, which isn't healthy for "real" writing I've heard. Or maybe it is. But in any case, I've sworn not to start publishing any new fanfics until I've got a finished story (at least a first draft of all chapters).

Because working like this is rough and frantic. I miss too many self-imposed posting deadlines simply because I decided that I needed another scene /before/ what I've already written. And then I can't seem to figure out a specific ending scene, so I write stuff for the next chapter that happens after that. And now I see I didn't really finish something in the middle and need to add more to explain it. And then I realize the original chapter is too long, so now I've got three chapters worth of material with a hole in the middle of the first chapter. And now it is three months later with no updates and I have a beautiful mess of words I love and three huge unpublishable chapters.

Not fun.

So yes. Do detailed plotting ahead of time. Unlike me.

--------------

*Mood*

When I sit down to write, it is because I have the time to write and I'm not physically incapable of writing. This is usually once a day, which I can almost make a hard requirement. Every day is my goal, for at least half an hour, whether I think it is a great idea or not. I've never hit this lower time limit, once I've actually started writing.

Please note that this is writing time, not staring at my previous work time. I proof away from my writing time. I think one needs to make that separation, or everything turns into casual proofreading with your feet on the desk and nothing getting done but one paragraph receiving a dozen non-substantial edits.

The only "mood" thing really for me is whether to write new stuff or edit old stuff I've already basically finished and started editing and proofing (usually this is at least a mostly completed chapter). At the point I actually sit down to write, I've usually already done some casual proofing on things I've written previously and sometimes have lots of notes on that material. If I don't have anything I've already decided needs editing work badly, I /have to/ (this is not optional) write something new.

A new chapter on some story, an outline for a brand new story, something. Write every day.

*tl;dr* backup your shit in the cloud, maybe do a plot outline and keep it in a file somewhere, fucking write every day

*edit for more

**edit for ugly
