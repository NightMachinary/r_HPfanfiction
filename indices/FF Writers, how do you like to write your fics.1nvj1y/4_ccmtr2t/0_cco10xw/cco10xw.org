The whole "if I don't remember" thing is dangerous and provably wrong. Maybe your cat gets run over the day you have a blockbuster idea. Not logical. Please record all ideas and sort later, unless you /literally/ couldn't care less.

I'd suggest keeping a plain text "idea file" and just stick things in there the moment they occur to you. Just a single sentence note, nothing complicated. Make sure you can access and edit it from your writing computer and any mobile devices you might always have on you.

Kudos on the cloud storage. Remember that that isn't actually backup for "live" files, though. If you don't notice deleting half of your file, then save it over the cloud storage file location, you lose all that data unless your cloud solution or your local system has its own file versioning solution. I don't remember if Google's system does this or not, or how granular it is if they do have one.
