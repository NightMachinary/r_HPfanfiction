Generally I get ideas by reading other fics, books or watching a movie or a tv series but i don't write it down if by two or three days i don't remember it then it wasn't probably a very good idea.

Wen i have an idea i cant get out of my head for a few days i open Q10 and start typing a very rough outline of the first few chapter and the ending. then i start writing on the same file and delete thing i already expanded

I use sites like Google, Google Translate and Theasaurus.com to find words i need also i use the HP wiki as reference.

I use a google drive folder to keep all my files on the cloud as a backup
