I've written four partial fics, so far. Two fell into writers-block limbo after canon events rendered them AU and I couldn't bear to continue. The third, thought not chronologically, was a Harry Potter/Redwall crossover that completely train-wrecked, so I scrapped it.

My problem: I didn't plot structure. I almost fell into the same trap with my forth, and current fic. A WIP post-DH titled "Harry Potter and the Concept of Freedom". I started almost 2 years ago (first chapter was published on FF.net in 10/2011) and I managed to get about 17 chapters published almost completely off of my brain-case in 1 year, working in bursts when inspiration and desire found me. However, I did also make heavy use of good-old pad an paper back when I first started. The other problem I still face is a lack of a beta. I tried submitting to MuggleNet Fanfiction sometime in 2012, and got rejected because I had gotten my dialogue punctuation wrong in several places. I was pretty irked, but it forced me to go back through all 15+ chapters in my Master copy, which is in a folder in my Dropbox, correcting every instance of the error, and rephrasing sections to make a bit better sense. I also pulled the last 7 chapters I had published and am in the process of republishing the first part of Act I of III.

Today, I finally sat down, opened a new Word document, and thoroughly dumped my 3-act plotline, original character bios, and extensive head-canon to support plot. Most of it won't make it's way into the published story. However, when I'm done, I think I may publish all of my notes and other stuff as a Lost Chapters Edition, along with explicit scenes that can't be published on FF.net. Canon pairings, with fluff and drama interspersed.

If anyone wants to beta, I'm taking applicants. PM me. If you want to look at the first 10 chapters, search my handle on FF.net. EDIT AGAIN: Also bear in mind that I'm still renovating those first 10 chapters. Pardon the dust-bunnies.
