I really connected with Harry because a lot about him was relatable to me. Plus I tend to really, really hate how most people write kids. All syrupy sweet and full of lisps and sticky fingers and dimples. And authors can't even come up with original personalities for the little brats, they're just carbon copies of their parents.
