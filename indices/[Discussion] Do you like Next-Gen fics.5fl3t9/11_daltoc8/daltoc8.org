I like the Harry Potter universe but dislike the epilogue, next gen has potential for showing a lot of new attitudes but often spirals into OC meets James Sirius potter and sparks fly meanwhile rose/Malfoy spawn. We have plenty of those. What about a next gen story where harry/Daphne post book 7 happened, how does Harry deal with having Draco as a brother in law and I would assume close children. How would Ron deal with this? I've read a few books where Hermione gets slapped down for her attitude but there needs to be more, she cannot succeed in the workplace with her attitude, how does Harry deal with this or has he moved away from those two as he explores the wider wizarding world.
