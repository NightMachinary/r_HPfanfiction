Not necessarily, no. There's almost nothing a next-gen fic really offers that you can't find with the original generation. In next-gen fics, Albus will be a miniature Harry, Rose a miniature Hermione, and (more often than not) Scorpius a miniature Draco who isn't a dick. Lily will just be Ginny, James will be either one of his namesakes, and Hugo will be Ron. With the exception of Scorpius, there's not a single character that you can't get in some capacity with the original trio. I'd rather read about them than imitations. If there's an original characterisation of the above characters in a fic, I might be interested, but the vast majority of next gen fics follow safe imitation of the original series, which is boring.

I'd much rather read a post-epilogue fic with the trio and Ginny as the main characters dealing with middle-aged angst and old people shit like kidney stones and gout, before reading about expys of them run around Hogwarts doing whatever.
