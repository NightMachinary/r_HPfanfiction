Not particularly... I'm attached to the characters we grew up with. I am not that interested in reading about their children when their adult life is vastly more interesting. I would much rather read about a 30-something or 40-something-year-old Hermione trying to navigate life with the odd mention of children/next gen characters sprinkled throughout.

Don't get me wrong though. If someone could point me in the direction of a really good piece, I certainly would give it a try.
