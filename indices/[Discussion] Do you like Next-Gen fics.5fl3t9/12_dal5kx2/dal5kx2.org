Ehhh. They're really hard for me to get into. I have no problem reading a fic where a child ends up involved (like Harry adopting Teddy, as one example), but some that I've come across have such inconsistent characterizations. Either the kids have the same personality as one of their parents (and often it's daugher = mother), or the parents become some caricature.

Then there's the issue of original plot. Some authors are amazing with it, some can take a common type of plot (new big bad, questionable ministry actions...) and do something awesome. But sometimes it seems like it's the main series just repeated with characters that we're supposed to believe are their kids.

To be fair, however, I don't seek out next-gen fics, so what I've come across may not be an appropriate sample size.
