I didn't think I would, because what do I care about a couple of practically oc kids, right? But then I read a couple of really good ones and realized that, as with any other genre/pairing/era, the only thing that really matters to me is the skill of the author.

I have shipped ships I never thought I would and felt so deeply for characters I never really cared about, just because someone wrote them so well that I couldn't help myself. And that really sums up everything that I love about fanfic. Next-gen is no exception to that.
