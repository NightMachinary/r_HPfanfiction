I think linkffn(questions and answers) does the next gen thing pretty well. Its kind of slice of life and very family focused though the pace is quite slow. Each next gen character has their own personality and mini story arc and challenges. I liked that one of the storylines is that the kids don't know the gritty details of what the war was like and they keep trying to find out. Harry and co act like adults and there is a lot of focus on parenting. I think the fic is kinda like the TV show called Parenthood..
