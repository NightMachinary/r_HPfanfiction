Not particularly. It's unnerving to see Harry, Ron, and Hermione written off to the side with a focus on what are generally OCs with only the guide of that beast of an epilogue to tug along those who try to cling to a canon-compliance.

Cursed Child doesn't count as canon to me, but it does highlight what I dislike about most fanfiction of this type - these characters lived through some trying times in their most formative years. Their development beyond the seven books seems stunted in most of the fanfiction I've read, 'moving on' usually entailing them remaining in effect exactly the same except with a mention of a receding hairline here and crows feet there to assure the readers that "they really are Grown Upsâ„¢ now, I swear".

I didn't realize I was so passionate about it, to be honest. If there are fics of this sort that people who disagree with me can link, I'd love to have my mind changed. I'm sure I've just not had the best of luck in what I've stumbled upon in my reading.
