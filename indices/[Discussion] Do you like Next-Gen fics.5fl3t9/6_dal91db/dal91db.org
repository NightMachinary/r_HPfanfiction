As others have said, I'm attached to the characters I grew up with. I don't get enjoyment from reading about their (too convenient) offspring. They spark no interest in me, but I'm also on the "Epilogue, what epilogue?" train, so that could have an effect.

Don't get me wrong. I don't hate children in stories, and I tend to enjoy stories with Teddy as a supporting character, but I like the focus to be on the friends I grew up with. I especially like stories that delve into the effects the war had on everyone, not just the trio, and how the world rebuilds/becomes better along the way.
