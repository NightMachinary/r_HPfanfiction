I do like next gen. My favorite kind of next gen are the ones that explore the effects the war may have left on the magical world and how it influences next gen characters lives. I also like the ones that look at how public perceptions of their parents for like Harry's kids or Draco's effect their relationships with their peers, authority figures, and their parents and the way they live in general.
