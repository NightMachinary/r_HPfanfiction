Yes and no. I have noticed that most Rose/Scorpius rom-coms are just the author re-writing Draco/Hermione fics with their respective kids. I am not particularly fond of the pairing, just as I'm not fond of the cliched hate-to-love relationships in general. These stories I avoid.

(Ironically, their fanon characterisations were roughly switched in Cursed Child. Rose was rather arrogant and bitchy, Scorpius was genuinely sweet.)

On the other hand, Next-Gen adventure fics have some of the most original plots in fanfiction. Since they're completely free of canon rails, they offer that bit of originality that is difficult to find in the rest of the fandom. When I get sick of similar plots in other stories, I go hunt down one of these. I especially like fics that incorporate both the kids and adult characters of Harry's generation. I rate [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]], [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/11226787/1][Clash]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10573310/1/A-Fight-for-Love-and-Glory][A Fight for Love and Glory]] as some of my favorite fics in the fandom.
