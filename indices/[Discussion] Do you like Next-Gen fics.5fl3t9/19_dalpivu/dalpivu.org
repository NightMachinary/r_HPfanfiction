I'm something of a fan. I can only take so much Harry fighting Voldemort, so it's nice to have a fluffy change every so often. Not fond of CC or CC-inspired fics though. However, the idea of the titular Cursed Child isn't terrible and I would be open to reading a fic with them as the main character if I can find a good one that isn't influenced too much by CC.
