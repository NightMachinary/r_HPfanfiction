The problem is the villain. If the villain is too powerful I feel like they are stepping on Voldemort's toes in a way that cheapens the main series. If the villain is too weak then it raises the question of why they're a threat at all - the Aurors should be able to take care of them easily.

It's a catch-22 but there are ways out. One is to have a clever rather than strong villain. Another is to tell drama or politics stories rather than heroic action-adventure.

But I don't think many fics do very well at those things in general, and post-Hogwarts is no different.
