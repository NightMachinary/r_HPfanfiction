I know for a fact that I'm going to be in a very, very small group here, so do bear with me. :')

I, in my sane mind, consider the Cursed Child to be canon. Full stop. Mrs. Rowling wrote it and I accept it, just like all Pottermore writings. If she tweets out that Harry Potter grew up to become a pornstar, I would embrace that and believe it. Somethings I disagree with, such as the trolley lady becoming some giant monster, but I don't need to use that in any of my fics, and neither do you.

Cursed Child essentially takes place in an alternate world, a world where anything is possible. We, as writers, do the same thing with what we write. We change the world to suit our needs. Cursed Child is essentially an alternate universe. I have always been iffy with timetravel. There's fics that take the person back to the Founders' Era, 1945, et cetera. It seems odd that something where everyone's in a fucked up world isn't plausible.

If I do read a next-gen fic, I'll only read it if it's Albus focused. I don't care about James. I don't care about Lily. I may read a Hugo related fic because my head canon is that he's adorable and walks around in clothes too big for him. But I will only read it if it's Albus focused, as I said above.

I disagree with a lot of Cursed Child, but I did the same with the world we were given. That's the great thing about fanfiction. We can change it for our stories if we want. None of us need to use it.

Oh my God, I rambled subconsciously. I'll read next-gen fics if Albus is in it. I'll read it if it's Scorbus, as well.
