Sorvan's [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54][The Meaning of One]] Hagrid and Luna bond over magical creatures pretty much immediately after meeting for the first time and while it's not exactly a centerpiece of the story their friendship is repeatedly brought up again whenever either of the two shows up.

Note that the story is a Harry/Ginny soulbond fic, which I know isn't everyone's cup of tea (even if it is one of the best executions of the trope I've seen so far)
