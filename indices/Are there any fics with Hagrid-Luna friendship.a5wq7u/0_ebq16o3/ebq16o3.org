Definitely feels like something that could be canon, we just never saw it because it didn't happen in front of Harry's POV.

Maybe Hagrid was the one who told her where to find the thestrals... maybe Hagrid was a friend to her during her early years when it's strongly hinted at her being picked on... I'd like to think of her and Hagrid having tea together sometimes, perhaps he is more adamant debating her about the existance of snorkaks and nargles and other creatures. PERHAPS, MAJOR PERHAPS, he's the one who knew Newt and years later at some fundraiser for magical creatures she goes over to talk with Hagrid and he introduces her to the grandson of an old friend of his, Rolf Scamander.
