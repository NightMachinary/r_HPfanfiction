Sadly, there isn't much on Fanfiction.net--which is all the more the disappointing as it's one of my very favorite ideas for stories.

For one-shots, there's "Hope" and "A Different Sort."

I'm not as well-versed for any one-shots for Archive Of Our Own.

There's a couple of small subplots where this comes into play in longer fics.

The classic Nightmares of Future Past has a first-year Luna being somewhat awestruck by Hagrid, as she's never met a half-giant before, but she can't understand why people don't like him, as Hagrid is very nice. Luna, being Luna, has no brain-to-mouth filter and tells Hagrid this while visiting him (alongside Harry and Co.) for tea.

There's also a very tender scene in the fic /Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection/ where Hagrid is showing the fourth-years thestrals for a lesson. Luna is the only one who can see them, and Hagrid's gentle but firm affirmations of thestrals improves her opinions of him as a teacher dramatically.

On that note, /Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection/ is an excellent Luna-fic in its own right. The scene in question is in Chapter Eleven.
