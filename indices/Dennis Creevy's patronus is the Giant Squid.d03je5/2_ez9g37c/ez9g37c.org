Everyone else is making hentai jokes, but I'm thinking about how the squid rescued Dennis from falling out the boat on the way across the lake in his first year (according to his account and Colin's speculation, anyway) and as a result he considers the squid to be his protector. Which is exactly what a Patronus is.
