I find it interesting that a lot of the criticism I see for the story is that it was cliche and trope filled, which is strange because it felt like it did that less than 90% of the rest of the Potter fiction out there which is filled with all the same cliches every story.

Oh well, still enjoyed it. Nothing will ever be worse than My Immortal
