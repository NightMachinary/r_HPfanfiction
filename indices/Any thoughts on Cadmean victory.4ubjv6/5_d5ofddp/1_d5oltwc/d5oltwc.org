Agreed.

In many ways the fic is pretty horrible; nothing ever really truly challenges Harry and Fleur, all adversities are more road bumps than obstacles, the love story is at times quite hard to believe in and all that. It's all the jazz that make a fanfic writer a fanfic writer and not a professional, blockbuster author.

Yet it is, still, a very good read. I truly enjoyed reading it, although I admit to skipping a lot of the wordier parts simply because there is too much text in there and too much stuff that I find both unnecessary and hard to stomach. The broad outline of the story still shines quite bright, in my opinion.
