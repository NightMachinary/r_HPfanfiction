So it seems to me that after all this time everyone on here has assumed it's bad.

I disagree. Are most of their criticism valid? Yes. Some of the writing is so I'm 13 and this is edgy that it's painful. Yes some of the tropes are reallyyyy bad.

But overall? I think it's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. It was a fun read that I really enjoyed. I actually was really eager whenever the author would push out a new chapter. Regardless of how you feel about it, you have to respect the author's commitment and never abandoning it. I think if you felt like it was worth reading and enjoyed it, then you should. It isn't for everyone. If you can stomachs the tropes and writing, then I think it's a really good read.

In the last 10-15 chapters, it becomes really evident that the author was a little tired of writing it and tried to hurry it up and end it. He or she tried a whole bunch of different writing styles that feel really jarring. So I do agree that the Voldemort fight scene is really hard to follow.

Also the Harry/Fleur romance is one of the best developed ones in the genre, regardless of some of the tropiness. You can find WAY worse romances written in 95% of other fics of all ships. It really got me to feel like they were in a genuine relationship, the small details were such nice touches.
