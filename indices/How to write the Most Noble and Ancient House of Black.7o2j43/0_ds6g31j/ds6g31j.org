The Blacks are a dysfunctional family living in their own fantasy world that no longer exists and probably never existed. Their pseudo-aristocratic attitude clashes with a world that doesn't recognize their claims of innate superiority. While pureblood supremacist beliefs are widespread, their power is diminished to an extent that a muggle-born can become Minister of Magic.

So while the Blacks are still rich and privileged, each generation of Blacks witnesses that they're less privileged than their parents, and they long for a past glory long gone. They're not the nobles they pretend to be, they are a family of deplorables with a history of mental illness excarbated by inbreeding. In such a situation, especially if you believe yourself to be innately superior and the blame therefore can't rest with yourselff, it is tempting to engage in scapegoating and the creation of nonsensical conspiracy theories. And that's what Sirius' parents, as well as Andromeda's do, blaming muggle-borns, "blood-traitors", and everyone else they deem beneath themselves.

A radicalized version of this thinking leads Regulus and Bellatrix to the Death Eaters, whereas Sirius, Andromeda and Uncle Alphard all at some points have cracks appear in that worldview that lead to their estrangement from their family.

So my recommendation would be to include some scenes in which Andromeda realizes the discrepancy between the worldview instilled into her by her family and the reality of the wider wizarding world.

For the relationship between the sisters, I think that their initially close relationship becomes increasingly strained by the diverging beliefs of Bellatrix and Andromeda. I think that especially Andromeda and Narcissa will struggle with the love for her sisters even though they are becoming staunch ideological opponents. Ultimately, they reach a breaking point that leads to Andromeda being cast out from her family.
