I agree with this A LOT. I think it says a lot that Andromeda was sorted into Slytherin like every other Black before her. People try and equate her to Sirius, which I don't believe is the case. She was a Slytherin who somehow managed to fall in love with a muggleborn. Sirius was never a Slytherin, he was always rebellious and staunchly against the teachings of his family. From day one on the train he expresses a desire to placed somewhere else other than Slytherin. He flourished under James' friendship and was guided strongly towards the path of bravery and was desperate to prove he was nothing like his family. Quite frankly I don't believe Andromeda gave a damn what people thought of her. She did what she wanted as a Black and when she displeased her family, I wouldn't be surprised if there was an attitude of “I'll do whatever I damn well please.”
