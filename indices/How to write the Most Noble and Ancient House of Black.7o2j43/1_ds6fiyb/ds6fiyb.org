I am writing the backstory of the Black sisters for my own fic (No longer alone) so take this with a grain of salt since I have to fit it into a certain plot. I wanted to develop their characters into more than "good sister", "somewhat bad sister" and "crazy sister". But House Black dynamics boil down to four main aspects for me.

1.) The sisters used to love each other unconditionally. Narcissa as the youngest was watched over by two slightly unhinged and overprotective sisters. In a family where love was not given freely the three of them grew up relying on each other.

2.) Andromeda's marriage caused a chain of events which eventually lead to the creation of the infamous Bellatrix Lestrange. After Andi got hitched her sisters were rushed into contracted marriages to "upstanding members of the society". Bella was not born a sadistic bitch. I don't even see her as a supporter of Voldemort before her marriage. All of the Black sisters were raised to believe in the superiority of purebloods, something they all agreed on to a certain extent because having magic would not stop them from using the "achievements of the Muggles". Muggles were second-class people who had their uses, not vermin to be exterminated. Ideologically that puts them closer to Grindelwald than to Voldemort. Andromeda shed that believe over the years thanks to her muggle in-laws. Narcissa kept the attitude she was raised with while the Lestranges drove Bella into the militant extension of that belief. After Andromeda eloped her sisters were contracted to Lestrange and Malfoy. Malfoy was happy with his trophy wife while the Lestranges broke the rebellious Bella and turned her into the monster she became through conditioning (torture those muggles or get tortured yourself), not through some loyalty potion bullshit. Andi blames herself for that since without her marriage the contracts would not have been signed.

3.) Andromeda and Narcissa are on friendly terms. They have secret meetings once every couple months (or at least no one on Narcissa's side knows about them). Both miss their sister whom they lost two decades ago due to the Lestranges and both feel guilty about it because they feel like they failed Bella (Andromeda) or could have done more to help her (Narcissa).

4.) Andromeda is not the embodiment of the "Light side". Andromeda is a pragmatist, someone who would kill to protect her family. She makes decisions based on her family's welfare (Edward, Nymphadora, Edward's parents, Narcissa), not "looking at the bigger picture". If she had the choice between saving her husband/daughter/sister or saving five hundred others she would sacrifice the whole lot without remorse. She could live under Voldemort if her family was safe. She stayed out of the first war because that conflict did not concern her. Andromeda is not a patriot (unlike her husband and daughter), running away is a valid choice for her. She would rather hop aboard British Airways Flight 15 to Sydney via Singapore than stay in Britain and fight the war.
