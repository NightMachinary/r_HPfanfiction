I think the most information from canon is in OotP when Sirius is showing Harry the tapestry. I write about the Black family a lot, and what I've gotten from canon is that they're mostly pure blood fanatics and generally miserable, with a line of psychopathy running through, cropping up now and then (like in Bellatrix).

With that, you can make Andromeda seem more of an outcast - perhaps she's not so enthusiastic about what's expected of her, or she's not as pretty as the others, thus earning her the spot of least favorite daughter at an early age, further compounding her feelings of alienation. Perhaps she'd feel resentment toward her sisters for that.

Her parents can be either abusive rage-aholics or cold and snide, or one can be the former and the other the latter...you can play with them a bit but I can't imagine either of them would be too normal.

Anyway, those are just some headcanons and such. We know from canon that she was disowned and that both of her sisters shunned her after she went off with Tonks, so it's clear she either wasn't valued from the start or her family took it as the ultimate betrayal. Probably both.

Edit: also link me when you're done. I'm always up for a good Andromeda story.
