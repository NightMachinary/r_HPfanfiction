First of all,

Noble is a binary value. You either are or aren't. Ancient may be a matter of degrees, as tracing lineage more than a thousand years back really should qualify you to claim 'older than most' in your regalia. Therefore, it is the 'Noble and Most Ancient House of Black'.

Being a Black no doubt meant great care and concern over reputation and influence was the family dynamic. Bellatrix was the eldest and expected to lead her sisters towards proper positions that would reflect well on the House. She probably rebelled against that by falling in with extremists and striving to be the most deadly duelist around.

Andromeda was also intended to marry well and bring honour to the House, but I get the sense that she had a quite sarcastic streak and a wicked sense of humour about all the posturing and bloviating. She nearly succumbed to the pressure of expectations, but there was this guy who made her laugh and maybe one day he said, "You're a witch. If something bothers you, change it."

Faced with the madcap eldest daughter and defiant middle daughter, the obligations fell on the shoulders of Narcissa. Which is not to say that she hates her life or her family or even her husband, but you get the sense that she had only one child for a reason.
