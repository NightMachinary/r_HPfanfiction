This sounds like a great summation of that wonderful Narcissa comic (don't know what else to call it) - where she was determined to Minister of Magic but as Bellatrix goes a bit insane (in the comic she cuts open her womb) and Andromeda gets disinherited, she realises she needs to take up the responsibilities her sisters shirked.
