From what I remember, it's rather satisfying and it ends about as abruptly as the early HP books do: the plot arc is concluded and Harry is finished with another year at school. It is satisfying and complete enough, but I wanted more after being so invested in the character development. Definitely worth a read for a story without child politicians, even though some of the children are distinctly aware of how complicated the world is and must face things like having Death Eater relatives. Much more realistic and well done than so many Slytherin fics.
