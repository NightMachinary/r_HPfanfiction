linkffn(On the Way to Greatness) does a really realistic Slytherin Harry. It's quite similar to canon for the first couple of chapters but really takes off on its own. linkffn(When in Doubt Obliviate) is much more light-hearted and humorous but is surprisingly well-done and believable given its cracky premise.
