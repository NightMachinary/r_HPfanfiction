A lot of fanfics have Wizarding Britain essentially be an oligarchy or aristocracy. And while I think the former can fit with canon, I think given the size of the population and the relative egalitarianism you would expect from a society where pretty much anyone can be powerful, it is possible to go in the other direction.

Wizarding Britain could be closer to a New England style town government than it is to modern Republics. The Minister and the Wizengamot have the power to handle the day to day and legislate, but anyone can start a petition and call a meeting where at least 20% of the population needs to show up to vote to overturn or pass legislation or oust someone from office.
