So if it had to be a 2/3 vote, then I believe that the leader of one of parties in the Wizengamot has to call the vote. So would it make sense that the only people that have the power to call for impeachment as: the Chief Warlock, the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and the Majority Leader?

Also do you think it would work, that to begin the impeachment process the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement has to agree with the decision ?
