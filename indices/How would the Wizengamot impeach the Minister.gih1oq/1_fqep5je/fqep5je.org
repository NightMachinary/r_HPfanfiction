We have no idea.

That is to say, the Wizengamot is not at all explained in canon - meaning that the authors get to make a decision on it!

One option would be through a straight vote of the Wizengamot - say, needing a 2/3 or 3/4 majority, and that would be enough to relieve a minister of their duties. That may or may not need a trial.

An alternative could be that they can't do it themselves - but with a 2/3 vote, they could kick off a recall election, which would then set things up for a removal.

But whatever gets used, it has to be the author's discussion. We don't know if the Wizengamot is partly or entirely or not elected, we don't know if the minister has a say over its members, we don't know how the minister gets elected, etc. It's all /very/ vague, so saying anything as a blanket statement doesn't work well.
