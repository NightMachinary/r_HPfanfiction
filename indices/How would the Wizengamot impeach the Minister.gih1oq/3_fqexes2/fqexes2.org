Ah, the eternal question of Magical Britain's political system.

It can be anything you want really, even (maybe especially) something absurd. What it probably shouldn't be is something overly complex that has all the trappings of modern political systems. It just doesn't fit the size or the general /wizard/-ness of British wizards...

In any case, you don't impeach someone that works for you, you just fire him. Or, said another way, someone says they don't like him anymore (i.e. a motion of no confidence), they just hold a vote on it, then debate who to pick next, then hold a vote on making that person Minister, like they would any other thing, with the same procedures. And maybe there is some kind of weird symbolic ceremony that makes no sense to proclaim it, because that's just how wizard do things...

Going a little more into headcanon territory: we don't know much about the inner workings of Magical Britain's political system, but it would make sense for it to be vaguely British and somewhat small. That means no american-style separation of powers or check and balances, no Presidential system at all really, and none of the complicated political rituals that exist in our world because of the size of countries.

Basically take the British system circa 1700, remove the monarch, then merge and squeeze all the institutions until you reach what's needed to govern the population of a small town, except fully independent.

You end up with something relatively pragmatic (if somewhat alien compared to the government of a modern country): no separation of powers, no fixed terms for ministers or Wizengamot members, no popular election, a weird mix of formal and informal, probably no formal political parties at all, and definitely a much smaller accumulation of litigation and precedent. Just a bunch of very old men and women who definitely won't be going around running the place, so they delegate. And they obviously get to pick who they delegate to (now whether that ends up being an oligarchy, an aristocracy or even a Greek-style republic, ... all three are possible).
