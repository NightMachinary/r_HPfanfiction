  Because a guy getting raped by a woman is just "wrong".

I hate shit views like this. It's horrible and doesn't help people. And yes Hellstrike, I really do want to read a story where Romalda goes to prison for what she tried to do in canon, a juvenile one for at least a year or two maybe, but I've never found any. Because of course it's dismissed and laughable when it's anything but plain male on female sexual assault or harassment. Yes /S for Sarcasm.
