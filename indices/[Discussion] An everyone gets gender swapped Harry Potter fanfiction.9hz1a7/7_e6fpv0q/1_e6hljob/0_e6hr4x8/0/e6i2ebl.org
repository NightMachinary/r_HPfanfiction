Mr. Riddle is a country squire. That's 'wealthy enough not to need a job' but not exceptionally wealthy nor particularly well connected. I mean he'd know the various members of local government and probably even his MP but that's not exceptionally connected, especially if Thomasina was induced to leave their area of influence.

It would also depend a lot on the timings. When she was thrown off by her family vs when the love potions stopped as to whether her parents would be willing to pay for an abortion. A lot of the early abortion laws were in place to protect women from a procedure which could be exceptionally dangerous, especially late term abortions.

Although I'm certainly inclined to say that Thomasina would probably have attempted to self-induce an abortion with the old standbys of alcohol, hot baths or an "accidental" tumble down the stairs.

And even if they agreed to pay for the abortion and it went well, then she's still considered damaged goods.

A male Tom Riddle Sr is perceived to be just another rich gentleman who decided to have his way with a girl who couldn't protest. Which doesn't make him less of a rape victim but what happened to him doesn't reflect on him as negatively as it would have on a female Tom Riddle Sr. Although I suppose at least Thomasina would be able to vocalise what happened to her as rape, even if that didn't actually change antyhing.
