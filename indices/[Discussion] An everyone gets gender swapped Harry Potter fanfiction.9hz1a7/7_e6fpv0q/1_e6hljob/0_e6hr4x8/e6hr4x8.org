According to Wikipedia there were 100000 abortions in the UK each year in the 1910s. While illegal, I'm pretty sure that the Riddle family, being affluent and probably well connected, could have arranged something when their daughter was raped by the strange man from the edge of the village. Hell, there was a loophole which allowed abortions if carried out during birth until 1929.

Tl;dr: Abortions would have resolved the whole Voldemort issue, permanently.
