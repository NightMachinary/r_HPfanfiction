Yes, female on male rape or sexual assault is wrong. What Merope does to Tom Riddle Sr is awful and certainly made more so by the fact that, even past the magical drugging, he wouldn't have known to understand it as rape.

It's the 'getting her pregnant' part which pushes Morfin raping Thomasina to a slightly different category of awful because the consequences to the victim are that much harsher.

Essentially she would wake up one day after the love potions wore off and discover that she's pregnant. She's now an unmarried woman in a small country town who has been 'ruined' by the local tramp, which is not something that happens to Tom Riddle Sr. He may have been traumatised by his rape but the material consequences of what happened to him are negligible - he can and does go back to his previous life and what is /perceived/ as his little escapade with the local pauper girl is largely forgotten. For Thomasina Riddle it's much worse; she's now the joke of the town, her reputation and chances for marriage are in tatters, she wouldn't be welcome in her family's home even after delivering the child, she probably wouldn't be able to get an abortion and so she has to deal with carrying her rapist's baby to term while losing basically everything.

For all that Merope is an awful person and a rapist, she seems to have wanted her kid. We don't know anything about magical abortion or the attitudes to it but one assumes that if Merope was capable of brewing a love potion, she could have brewed something that would have ended her pregnancy if she so chose.

Instead Merope has hopes for her son, has obviously thought about a name and what she hoped he'd look like. True, she was likely living in poverty in London (although if 10 galleons still converted to Â£50 that's not a bad amount in the 1920's) but she grew up in poverty, it wouldn't have been as much of a shock to her as it would to a country squire's daughter. Thomasina Riddle's attitude toward her pregnancy and child is thus likely to be radically different. Would she even want to name the child?

And I wonder, what happens to Morfin. Since's he's not the one pregnant, he's still alive and likely to be so when his mother (Marvola?) and sister get out of prison. He may even still be alive when his daughter comes looking for the Riddles. Or who knows, he might have found another pretty woman to fixate on and assault.
