I like a lot of your ideas here. I love that Hermione becomes Leontes instead of Herman, that's clever.

Obviously, gender-swapping every single character is going to lead to some problems, but I say go with it. What I like about this idea (YOU GET A GENDER SWAP! AND YOU GET A GENDER SWAP! EVERYONE GETS A GENDER SWAP!) is that it really shakes up the story. Your Mary *should* be Mary Evans. And hell, your Ronalda (or Rhonda, lol?) should be Ronalda Prewett (because she would take the name of her now-father, who is now suddenly a bit unnervingly abusive toward his wife, lol).

As for the Merope/love potion topic you raised, IMO it was always very creepy, anyone (man or woman) drugging anyone to have sex without consent. For years, a love potion has always been synonymous with Rohypnol in my mind. But you're right of course -- without the gender swap, at least Merope wanted her pregnancy. But if you gender swap it, now the rape victim is now suddenly also unwillingly pregnant.

But it's not like that doesn't happen in real life.

So take my earlier advice -- go with it, see where it takes your story. Maybe Morfin wouldn't stop using the love potions until after Thomasina gave birth. Then, horrified, she stumbles away and... (and go from there). Or maybe he does stop using the love potions once she's pregnant, and Thomasina tries to escape and have an abortion and... (go from there). It wouldn't surprise me if it leads to the child being raised by Morfin until... (and go from there).

But this should all be backstory, possibly sprinkled in throughout your story. There's no need to tell the story in the exact same order, with only the genders being the different element. In order to hold your readers' attention, you should start somewhere in the early middle of your gender-swapped story, and focus on the elements of the story that change or that are drastically different or have an entirely different tone because of these changes.

Maybe start with some one-shots?
