I want to add something to the whole Voldemort problem: Merope died because she gave birth. If you gender swap everyone, Tom(asina) Jr. would grow up with one living parent (her father), that wanted her. Even though he raped her mother, which is absolutely horrible and disgusting no matter which gender rapist and victim have, he would have wanted and loved his daughter and that makes all the difference in the world. JKR said in an interview that something changes in a child's brain, when it grows up the way TMR did grow up. I always saw this as a hint that Tom Riddle was not born a psychopath, but made one (I think that technically makes him a sociopath). If you give your Tomasina Jr. even one personin this world that values and loves her, that changes absolutely everything. Even if her father goes to prison for rape. Knowing that one person in this world really wants you to be there, especially if related by blood changes everything.

I would love to read a difficult gut-wrenching tale about a hyperintelligent child of rape, that loves her father, but also has to deal with her anger and questioning her right to have a place in this world as she gets older, but I do realize that this is probably not what you're going to write.
