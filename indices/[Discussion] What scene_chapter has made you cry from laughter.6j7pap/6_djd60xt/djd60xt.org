[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/384445/chapters/629381][This]] fic seems like it would be a horror show, and to be honest, I didn't actually read after four or five chapters. But its written well enough, and there's a scene in the first chapter that made me laugh so hard that I cried. If you decide to read just the first chapter, its when "Hadrian" gets to James's story.
