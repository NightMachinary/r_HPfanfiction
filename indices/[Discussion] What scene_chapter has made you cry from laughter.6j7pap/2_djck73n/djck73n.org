One of the absolute funniest fics I've ever read is "The Secret Diary of Draco Malfoy: Aristocrat, Ne'er do Well, Rampant Homosexual" by Alysian_Fields. I've never laughed out loud so much when reading a fanfic before and can't point to a single chapter since just about all of them were funny.

It's a crack fic spoof of "Bridget Jones's Diary" with Draco as Bridget and Harry as Mark Darcy. Everyone is OOC, but if you enjoyed the original Bridget Jones, you'll love this version. While it ends on a bit of a shark jumping moment, it makes sense given the tone of the piece. Thankfully, it doesn't follow canon of either series too closely. It also contains references to other pop culture gems like "Clueless" and Draco calling his father the "gayest straight man" alive because of how he takes care of his hair.

Here's an example of how it's funny:

Friday 20th September.

Dear Diary,

[...]

Ooh, Professor Sprout just walked past. Ooh, there's a woman screaming for a makeover if ever there was one. Good God, the woman looks as though she's just thrown on an old potato sack and called it a robe. And is that the Sorting Hat she's got on her head? It certainly looks like it. Oh, and she could do with about a bucket-load of Dr Santiago's Sleek and Shine potion on that hair of hers. Ick. Oh, there's the bell. It's Herbology next, so I have to go and spend the next two hours looking at Sprout. Fabulous.

Sunday 22nd September.

Dear Diary,

Karma really is a bitch. Having mentioned how hideous Sprout is in my last entry, I went to Herbology and got a load of Stinksap in the face. This prompted a load of oh-so-funny comments from Blaise about whether I preferred to spit or swallow. I was not happy.
