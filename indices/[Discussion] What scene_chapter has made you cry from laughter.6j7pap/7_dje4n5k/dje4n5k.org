The scene in “You Did What!” with the “Hufflepuff for Life” declaration. It's audacious to the point where it can be considered cringe-worthy, sure, but with the series already setting you up for absurd humour and that is a punchline of a kind.

Then again, I've laughed out loud pretty much every chapter, so that's that.
