I was cracking up a lot while reading linkffn(10298713) but sadly the mood isn't consistent throughout the entire fic. I believe I dropped it eventually. Many of the first chapters are 10/10 though and it's worth checking out for how ingeniously it's written.

It has a great Madame Malkin scene too (chapter 2), funnily enough, and chapter 5 is really something else.
