This might be off-topic, but have any of you noticed that many of the fanfics named "Chaos Theory", "Butterfly Effect", and so on, still cling incredibly hard to the Stations of Canon? It's extremely frustrating - that's like a complete antithesis to the title, and they don't even do this ironically. As if regular canon rehashes weren't enough, these ones just lure you in and disappoint you later. The authors must know what their titles mean, right? It's just- argh!
