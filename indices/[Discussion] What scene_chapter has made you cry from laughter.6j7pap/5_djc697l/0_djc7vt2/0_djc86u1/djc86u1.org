Lol I generally hate canon rehashing and my biggest problem of all is The Triwizard Tournament without any changes made to it. Such a potential to make it interesting and surprising and nope.. it's like you're reading badly written Goblet of Fire every time, just ugh. I often stop reading if I see that it's going to be the usual snorefest.

Also hate when the author spends 100k+ words on every year from year 1. AND IT'S ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME PLOT AS CANON. Except Harry does all these things as a Slytherin. Or a girl. Or he befriends Draco or Severus while doing the canon things.

Yeah this is even deeper off-topic but damn.

I'm triggered.

Chaos Theory isn't a fic you'd want to read for the plot though, that's true, and if you take it seriously you're just gonna end up annoyed. I'd only ever link it for its quirkiness and that's it. It can be endearing if you accept it for what it is.
