I once watched this Hunter S Thompson documentary where his wife said that she would walk by his office and find him maniacally laughing while punched at his keyboard and I was like “I am Hunter S Thompson”.

Last week-ish I wrote a scene where I killed off one of the main characters. The whole time I was writing it I wanted to like live steam it or some shit.
