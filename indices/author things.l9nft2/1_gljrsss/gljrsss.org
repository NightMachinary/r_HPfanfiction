This is me too! I started my first fic at the beginning of the covid quarantine last March and finished it at around 550k words in six months. I wrote the first 70k words never expecting to post it, but as a way to detach a bit from the stress of life at the time. I never expected anyone to actually want to read it, and was just writing a fic I wanted to read. Now I'm about 175k words into the sequel and still love everything about the writing and plotting process.
