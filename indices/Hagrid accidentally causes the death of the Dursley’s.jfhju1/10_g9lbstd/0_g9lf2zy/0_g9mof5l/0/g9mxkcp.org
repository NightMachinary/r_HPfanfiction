Unless the government thought he was also dead. Not sure how it works in the UK, but in my home country if someone is declared as missing after a given time-period they are declared legally dead, this time period goes from years to 3 months if the person goes missing during an event in which there is a high chance of death (f ex. Earthquakes, hurricanes, being on a boat during a storm...) if the authorities had ruled that Harry tried to get back to the port by swimming during a storm chances are that it would fall in this category and he would be declared dead soon after. Yeah, if he wanted the Dursley's things he /could/ show up, but then he would be extensively questioned about what happened, how he survived and where he was, with the story being cross-checked by the government. He probably /could/ pull this off, but it /would/ be a rather big hassle
