I'd love to read a scene where soon after the Durselys' deaths, Harry is home alone and Aunt Marge comes in to inspect the house and whatever belongings she'd been left. Then Harry, because he hates Aunt Marge and would rather not interact with her or her brute of a dog if at all possible, evades her and hides just out of sight while she rummages through all the Dursleys' stuff.

It would be a v interesting scene if at some point during the visit, Marge just sits down on the couch or something and cries. Harry would have no clue how to react and if he should show himself and offer a cuppa or not, and yeah lmao I'd prefer if he just stayed out of sight and watched her sob, taking some form of guilty pleasure out of it. But that could be the start of him wondering if he really were fit for Slytherin after all (and hopefully accepting it).
