I think you might be confusing Lily's work and Dumbledore's.

One was on the house and needed Dursleys, the other was on Harry himself and never even took them into consideration (Liliy was not at speaking terms with her sister at the time and had every reason to assume that one of her friends or fellow Order members would take care of her son).
