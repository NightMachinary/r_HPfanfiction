Obvious knock on effect, the blood warding is broken. Before Harry has even gotten to Hogwarts. He needs a different way to defeat quirrel and can't rely on the blood wards frankly dubious protection going forward.\\
Other possible results; trouble for Hagrid at some point, Harry meeting Sirius at the start of year 3.

Either way, good idea. Would definitely read provided it was more than a canon rehash.
