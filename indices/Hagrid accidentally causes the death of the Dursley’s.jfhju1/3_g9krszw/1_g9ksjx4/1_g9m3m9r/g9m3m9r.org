I figure that without having to power the wards on the Dursley's house, the protection that Lily put on Harry suddenly gets more powerful.

The protection was at its weakest on 1st november 1981 after saving Harry's life. It didn't have enough power after reflecting a killing curse and vaporizing Voldemort to completely protect Harry from the soul shard, thus letting the leach latch onto Harry.

It would have ramped up to full power after a couple weeks and blasted that soul piece out of Harry's head, except that Dumbledore created the blood wards. And it had to work to protect not just Harry but the whole household, wasting all its power so it couldn't free Harry from the soul piece and its negative affects, like making Harry dumb, blind, and very passive.

A bit after Harry leaves for Hogwarts and the blood wards fall, the protection has a few weeks to charge up, and then it begins fixing things that had been hanging for 10 years.
