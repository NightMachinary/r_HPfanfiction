Maybe? It is implied by Dumbledore that he made something with the blood protections that created the wards, so maybe the actual protections on Harry himself will just start to degrade slowly, or even be kept to the very end. Though I also would prefer that he found another way of either keeping Quirrel in the room until Dumbledore arrives (supposedly not too much time after he killed Quirrel, so a obtainable goal) or outright defeating him (he thought he was going after Snape, so he has the perfect excuse to brush up on some nasty hexes), or even go a somewhat not so overdone route of stealing the stone himself by accident first and then giving it back to Flamel).
