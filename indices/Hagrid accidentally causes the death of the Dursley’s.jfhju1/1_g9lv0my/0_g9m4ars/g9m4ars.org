Plot twist: Hagrid was actually a time traveler who came back from after the war to keep his greatest friends (Harry and Dumbledore) out of harms way. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👍. But seriously, I would read the hell out of a story like that, for Hagrid to be the oblivious hero saving the day by accident would be a nice change.
