Ok, the sixth day of the twelfth month in the calendar currently in use, so. The one with the carelessness to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches; Born on the sixth day as the year dies; Born from parents who never meet him And the somewhat darkish teenager will mark him as his scapegoat, but he will have a patron that the teenager knows not; And either must die at the clumsy flubbing of the other, for both are too clumsy to never kill anyone; The one with the carelessness to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born on the sixth day as the year dies.
