If you wanted to make this a comedy, Hagrid could be the one to deal with ALL of the problems through the years.

Quirrelmort - maybe Hagrid comes to feed Fluffy just as Quirrel is going for the trapdoor. Hagrid yells to the Fluffy that it is dinner time as he backs in dragging some load of meat so he never sees Quirrel. Fluffy wakes, sees Quirrel, chomps down on him since he is reflexively hungry at Hagrid's call.

Basilisk - Hagrid comes into the castle to show Harry his prize rooster, maybe it has blue feet or something. At that time the basilisk is in the walls looking for its next victim. The rooster crows when Harry gets near to look, the basilisk dies in the wall - Finch's cat is the only victim. No other problems, no arrests, no challenge to Dumbledore's position.

Sirius - Hagrid catches Sirius in Grim form in the forest, decided to make him one of his special pets. Sirius now has shelter/warmth/food/caretaker. One day the Trio come in, Ron with Scabbers. The grim pounces on the rat. Just before he is killed the rat transforms back into Peter to avoid getting his head torn off by the grim. Everyone is shocked, but Hagrid recognized Peter. Arrest, interogation, Sirius is now known to be innocent. Maybe Sirius comes to the Ministry later for his pardon.
