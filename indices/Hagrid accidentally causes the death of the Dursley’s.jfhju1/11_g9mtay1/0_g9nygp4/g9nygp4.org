Depending on how you want to make the trace work he could trick a magical into getting close enough to his house that he would be able to do so himself or, if you are okay with the ‘wardstone‘ plot-device he could buy some and use them. It would still create problems about water, food and energy supplies though (unless he found a more permanent way of sidestepping the trace, then he could be forced by the situations to teach himself enchanting and slowly convert the house into a magical one -maybe with the added incentive of doubling as a form of pretty revenge against the Dursley's).
