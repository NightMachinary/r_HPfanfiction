I feel like, as OP said, it's entirely plausible for story purposes that she didn't watch closely enough to know that the Dursley's had disappeared. As for anyone else reporting the Dursley's going missing, we don't know how much time Vernon had taken off work, or how he paid for the hut on the rock. It's also entirely plausible that the authorities didn't discover the Dursley's and who they were for the duration of August. The basic premise stands.

That being said, it is likely that their deaths would be found out by Dumbledore through Figg or some other channel before Harry was sent back at the end of the year.
