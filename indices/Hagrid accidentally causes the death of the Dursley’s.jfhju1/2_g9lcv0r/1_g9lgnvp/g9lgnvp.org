Eh, could boil down to many factors, first she may not have kept such a close eye on Harry. Many stories (even more so Dumbledore Bashing) put her as spying constantly on Harry and the Dursley's somehow while keeping detailed reports down to what they had for lunch and the color of their piss, these reports than would go to Dumbledore who would skim it to make sure nothing too big was happening and then ignore it. What if instead she was actually really only keeping tabs on Harry, the Dursley's would call her to take care of him sometimes and she would see him around time a couple of times and ask about if he is feeling well, than she tells it to Dumbledore later during casual conversations (really casual, she was in the order, they must be on friendly terms). She wouldn't notice if the Dursley's weren't around for some weeks if they didn't frequent the same social cycles, she has her own life to care about after all, seeing Harry walking around once or twice without any sign of distress would prevent her from worrying or even thinking there was any problem at all, then maybe she took a vacation of sorts now that her charge (even if casual) is in Hogwarts, if she had only arrived when Harry gets to the town she would be too busy re-organizing her house/life and catching up with friends to worry about not seeing the Dursley's for a couple of days.

Other ways would be to go with the easy way of just killing/sending her away offscreen and be done with it. Hell, even just sidestepping the whole issue by having her never having been sent there or being a muggle wouldn't be too hard, in the end her use as a character was mostly to make Dumbledore seem prepared (which backfired making him seem either incompetent or malicious) and later to help Harry carry Dudley home (which is now a no-issue).
