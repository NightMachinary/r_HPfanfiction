What about Mrs Figg?

She surely would have heard of The Dursleys deaths. She would have alerted Dumbledore, who would have investigate and put two and two together, and wouldn't have send Harry to an empty, and unprotected home.

She also would have noticed during the summer Harry being alone, too, and maybe report it.

We need to do something about her.

(No promise on writing anythingt, but you made think, I maybe might come up with something. Perhaps).
