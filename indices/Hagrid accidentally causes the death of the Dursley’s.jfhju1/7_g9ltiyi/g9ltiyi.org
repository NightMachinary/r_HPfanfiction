After returning to no home, Harry might go to the nearby park and owl Ron about the situation of no relatives there.

I expect the Weasleys would come to pick him up rather than let him stay alone in the park overnight without any protection. They might contact Dumbledore the next day but it would at least mean that Harry starts his summer living with Ron.

After that, Dumbledore might just figure it is best for Harry to stay with the Weasleys, maybe with some supplement to their income or such if needed.
