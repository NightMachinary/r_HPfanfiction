I'd read this in a heartbeat! Can someone please write a fanfiction of this? But no really, it's quite an interesting view point. I'm just wondering what would happen next. Would Harry be asked to speak to an auror? And if so, is he going to tell them that Hagrid not only used magic but left with the only boat? Because basically, it's Hagrid's fault, not Harry's. Harry is just an eleven year old boy. Is Hagrid going to be punished for using magic and "killing" the muggles?
