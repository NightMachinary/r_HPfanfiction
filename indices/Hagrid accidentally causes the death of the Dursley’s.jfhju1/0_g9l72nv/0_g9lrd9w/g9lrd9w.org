I don't think the aurors need get involved.

1) It is a muggle family who died. Who cares? 2) Dumbledore is the one who is arranging things - if anyone asks he can say that with Harry rejoining the wizarding community he no longer needs to stay with his aunt. 3) Almost everyone in the wizarding society will feel better with their hero living with magicals rather than muggles.
