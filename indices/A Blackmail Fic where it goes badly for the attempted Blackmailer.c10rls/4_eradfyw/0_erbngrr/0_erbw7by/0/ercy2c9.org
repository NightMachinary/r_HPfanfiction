But the idea of 'x tries to force y to do something and it goes badly for x' might still stand (i dont know, i didnt read it). so maybe even though op requested 'blackmail' he or she might be interested in the story. and if op /only/ wants blackmail, "It's not quite blackmail..." is sufficient warning to not read it.
