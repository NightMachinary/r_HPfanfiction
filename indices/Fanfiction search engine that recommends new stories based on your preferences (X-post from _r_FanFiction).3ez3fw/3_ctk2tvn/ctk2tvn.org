This is really great! Is there a way to simply implement a completed/not completed flag? I don't know if you search live or have a database you use, either way it wouldn't be that much work to parse the complete tag as well. Although I don't know how expensive the search will be this way. (ever looked at [[http://scryer.darklordpotter.net/]] ?)
