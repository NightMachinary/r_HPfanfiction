I second this, sorting by favs would be a nice edition too.

In addition to this, it would really help if you added some basic styling. I put some bottom margin for the list elements in stylish (just 0.5 em) and it makes it a lot easier on the eyes. It doesn't have to be elaborate or anything, even little bits help.
