You know, I've often thought about something like this for fanfiction. What I've always wanted is something similar to the recommendation system at myanimelist.net. I just figured that the HP community was too dead to really make it work.

This is actually fucking brilliant in both thought and execution. It leverages information already available, and makes searching for fics much easier than just using the FFN search or Scryer.

Whoever made this, great fucking job. This is an invaluable tool. I've already found two or three (good) fics that I've neverseen before, and I've been reading HPFF for over 12 years now.
