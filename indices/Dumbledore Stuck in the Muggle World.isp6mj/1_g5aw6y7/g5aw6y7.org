Would Dumbledore still be a wizard (the only wizard) in this prompt, or does he only keeps his memories of the Magical World?

If it's the former, I would really see him as a teacher (yes, pretty unexpected), but a teacher for the really difficult case. Like, a school has a "special" class full of difficult students, and just when the principal is ready to give up on them, Dumbledore appear with just the right qualifications and start to teach the class. Nothing the students try to make him leave work and in the end, Dumbledore help each and everyone of them to deal with their problem and put them back on the right path.

Or else, an orphanage/ school director. In a little British village, a building appeared almost overnight. It seems to be an orphanage handled by an old gentleman, it seems strange, but that man was able to show authority all the right autorizations and documents so they let it go.\\
With time, the orphanage is filled with children, all stranger than the other. People are convinced that only one person would not be able to manage them all, but somehow, that man is able to do it, almost effortlessly.
