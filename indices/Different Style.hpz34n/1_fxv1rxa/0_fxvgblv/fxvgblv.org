Yeah I know. I'm seeing lots of that in other fandoms too and I don't get it. It's so annoying. They could literally use any other POV and it would be fine, but they've got to use the “you are in the movie!” weirdo effect. Like WTH? I'd rather have the Mary Sue character that is clearly the author inserting themselves into the story than the strange “you” perspective.
