Said bookism:

"That was great!" Ron chortled.

"Yeah," Harry laughed.

"Think you're funny?" growled Malfoy.

"Thanks," smiled Hagrid.

Just use 'said', 'asked', 'replied', or cut out the dialogue tag entirely if possible. Also, change sentence styles here and there to keep it fresh, such as:

Ron smiled and said, "That was great!"

Excess adverbs:

"No way!" Hermione said excitedly.

"It's true," Harry said importantly.

Ron shook his head and said very aggressively "No."

Limit the -ly words after your saids (or said bookisms). Rather show the character's actions instead of just telling us it's 'important' or 'excited', etc.
