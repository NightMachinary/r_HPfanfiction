Honestly speaking, Daphne Greengrass does not have a fixed appearance in my head. Her body is as much as a blank slate as her personality.

She can have black or blond hair, pretty or just average, extremely pale or a slightly pink complexion, blue or green eyes . . . The only things that are constant in my image of her are that her hairs are straight, and that her height is in the average range for her age (though there was at least that one fic that made her extremely tall).

It's a bit sad, but I have a more definite image of several OC or quasi OC than I have of Daphne Greengrass (including her own sister).
