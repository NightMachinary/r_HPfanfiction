Brunette, pale skin, blue eyes, high cheek bones, tall. Very pretty. She tends to be quiet and a little sarcastic, but she's not an Ice Queen; she's introverted and at least calm seeming, but definitely not emotionless. Confident mostly, but can have bouts of shyness and awkwardness.

I kind of see her as having been a very shy kid who forced themselves not to be shy, but still not a delightful little social butterfly (said with love) like her little sister. In some of my fics, it's partly due to her growing up with a speech impediment that made her feel very self-conscious when speaking. She's most relaxed and talkative around friends, but get her on a subject she really cares about -like magical creatures say-and she can really come alive.
