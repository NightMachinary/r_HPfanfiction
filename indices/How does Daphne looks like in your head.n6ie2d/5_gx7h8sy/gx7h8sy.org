Her look in my fic that I actually just started on today finally has her average height for 15 (that's the age I'm starting 4th years at on my fic). Here's my exact description in book:

"Daphne was of average height for a girl of 15 with long legs comparatively speaking on a petite frame (she has b cups for example, this is not included in the book text but I'm noting it here because I'm my head, I see her with b cups). She has a pretty face, but not model pretty, it would be more accurate to describe her as girl next door pretty, or in american phraseology, southern bell cute. She has ice gray-blue eyes with long , pale rose gold hair and a creamy skin complexion that very few girls can make look good"

There ya go, that's how she looks to me. Didn't really get into how she dresses here as its just where I introduce her looks as a character, and at that moment harry was just admiring her from afar.

Personality wise, I'm going for a tsundere personality (I guess in a way this somewhat matches the ice queen vibe that a lot of other writes do for her)
