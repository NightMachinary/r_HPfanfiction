That's hard to say and depends on a lot of things but I'll do my best to describe how I see it (i.e. non of this is absolute, exceptions prove the rule)

I very rarely read stories with less than 1k words, I feel like most of them are badly written or miss descriptions and plot points.\\
For short ideas something between 3-15k is optimal in my opinion, enough to explain everything properly and flesh the story out a little. I hate it when a story/one-shot ends directly after the main plot point/event. You have created this situation/AU, so show me what happens in it, how characters react, etc.

For novel style fics it depends a lot on quality and/or content. A lot of inexperienced writers will try to do 5 years canon rehash in 40k words and I just know that is not going to be a story for me. If the plot or ship interests me but I can tell it's not going to be a great story or somewhat badly written my limit seems to be somewhere around 150k words. For me to read a 200-300k story it has be decently written and interest me. 400k+ has to be well written and tick a few boxes at least or ok-ish written and tick *a lot* of my boxes. In addition to that, I'll most likely put of reading a 400k+ story until I'm really in the mood for it or on holiday.

Also interisting, stories I've stopped reading in the middle seem to be mostly under 50k or above 300k words. I don't think I've finished more than ten 500k+ fics (out of an estimated 400-500 HP fanfics read total).\\
BTW this is all about the wordcount displayed online, I didn't combine stories and sequels or anything, that would get way to complicated
