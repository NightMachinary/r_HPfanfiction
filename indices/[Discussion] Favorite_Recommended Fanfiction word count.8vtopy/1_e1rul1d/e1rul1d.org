I read fanfictions of any +length+ word count as long as the plot is good and the writing aint all that bad.

Whats important to me is that the story is not a bunch of cliches strapped to a stripper pole on which the MCs are rutting like some cheap slut in club near the airport.

Best fanfictions I have read until today were of smaller wordcounts 5k-20k.

Though, longer fanfictions are always welcome, its hard to find some that really works out well and isnt riddled with plotholes.

I think the longest fanfiction I have read up until today is Love of Magic by Noodlehammer with around 700-800k words.I binge read it the first time and it took me a day and a night, whereas the second read was slower and I took around 3 days. Reading that long fanfictions that have a structured storyline are really rare and always interesting to read.(btw. I wish more authors would learn to base their stories on the classic structures that have worked since forever: exposition, inciting incident, peripeteia, retarding action, resolution, denouement - especially those authors that have issues bringing structure into their stories!)

tl;drAny l+ength+ word count is good but I prefer medium sized fanfictions with a decent centered plot.
