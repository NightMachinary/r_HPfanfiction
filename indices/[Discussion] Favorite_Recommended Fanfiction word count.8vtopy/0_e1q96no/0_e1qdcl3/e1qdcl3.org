Yeah, I completely agree with you there. Cauterize had a intriguing storyline, even now I go back to reread it sometimes. I've read I think the first half of Child of the Storm, but for some reason I took a "hiatus" on reading fanfictions and never really found the time to get back to it. I might continue reading it though. 2 fanfics that i read that were well over 500k that I actualy liked and finished were Vindico Atrum+The Black Heir, and The Rise of the Drackens
