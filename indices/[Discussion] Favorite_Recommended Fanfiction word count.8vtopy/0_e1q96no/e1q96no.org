I prefer things 100k+. But I also prefer things less than 500k or so.

Oneshots can be enjoyable, but for the most part I'll only read them if the idea really interests me. Off the top of my head, Cauterize is excellent, and so is With Nothing On My Tongue. That's about the only oneshots I like enough to remember. My main issue with oneshots is that they're oneshots, and I generally find even 50k fics to be too short to really be worth reading.

On the other hand, really long fics can be annoying as well. I find that in some longer fics the author just drags things out to a massive extent, and I'm really not a huge fan of that. I dropped Black Bond, for example, because I was really tired of the relationship denial, and I knew that by the end of the fic it wouldn't even be resolved. I do still enjoy some fics that are /longer/ than my preferences, though. Child Of The Storm(800k, with a 500k sequel) is still one of my favorite crossovers, and Eclipse Of The Sky(500k) is just outright one of my favorite fics. Linkffn(8897431; 2920229)

That doesn't at all mean I won't read stuff with less or more than my preferences, though.
