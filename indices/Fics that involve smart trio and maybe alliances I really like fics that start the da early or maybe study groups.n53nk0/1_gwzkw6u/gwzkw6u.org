Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past is incomplete and no longer on FFN (they took it down for bogus reasons and ignored the author's attempts to contact them about it), but a good read. PDF/eBook is available from [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1][Github]].

A big part of it is how Harry works to support his friends better this time and prepare them for what's coming. Neville and Ginny are brought into his circle of friends from day 1, Luna as soon as she's on the train, the DA starts in his second year, and Ron has had his eyes opened a bit to what the Boy Who Lived really faces, helping Ron to grow up a bit faster and put more effort into his studies. Hermione gets actual support and appreciation for her study goals, not just admiration of her intelligence. I really like how the author has written a Harry who's abnormally powerful, but it rarely comes up, because most of his life isn't about duelling, it's about his relationships with other people.
