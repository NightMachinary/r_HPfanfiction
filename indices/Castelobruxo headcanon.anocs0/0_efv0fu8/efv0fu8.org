I think many north americans have problems with how Rowling envisioned their magical society, so why would she do any better in south america? She lived in Portugal and knows enough, I feel, but in the end, it is just a couple of sentences of back story. I mean, perhaps the school had another name as you suggested and anyway Castelobruxo is such a stupid name- first, we did not have castles, second, we rarely use amalgamation to create words, third it should have been something like Fortaleza da Magia ou Castelo MÃ¡gico...something that gramatically made sense.
