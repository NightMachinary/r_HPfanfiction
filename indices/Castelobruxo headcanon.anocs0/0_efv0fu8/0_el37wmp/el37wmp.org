I think the thing that most annoys me about the NA worldbuilding is that there is only one school in the entire fuckin' /continent/.

Where the fuck do the Canadians go? Mexicans? We're honestly being told that parents ship their kids into the US for school? And Hawaii's a state, yeah, but it's also in the middle of the fucking ocean.

I mean, my god, California consistently ranks in the top ten of /world/ economies, and if you drop someone off in the middle of Texas it would take them several days to get out of state by car.

Even if we say there's only one wizard for every thousand muggles, sorry, "no-majs" and that only a third of the magical population is school age at any given time that's still...too fucking many students for one school to handle.
