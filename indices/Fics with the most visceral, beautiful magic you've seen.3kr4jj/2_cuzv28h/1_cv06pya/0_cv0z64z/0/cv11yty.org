I liked /Blindness/, but I really think that linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings), AngelaStarCat's other long fic is superior, particularily in this aspect. The magic is just as visceral (if not more so) but the particulars of Harry's path to power mean that there are inherent weaknesses that accompany his strength so he's never entirely OP. The first part does drag a bit, but once it picks up it becomes one of my all-time favorite fics.
