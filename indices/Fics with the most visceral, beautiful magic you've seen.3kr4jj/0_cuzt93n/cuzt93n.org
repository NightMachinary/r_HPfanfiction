I care more for strong characters more than magic, but linkffn(Ectomancer) has some unique elements of magic that I absolutely love. It is my favorite DLP fic, and I highly recommend it.

Also, linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent) has a well defined magic system that forms a major part of the story, and ties it in with canon-ish themes of love and forgiveness. Any stories that keep to canon themes get an automatic +1 from me.
