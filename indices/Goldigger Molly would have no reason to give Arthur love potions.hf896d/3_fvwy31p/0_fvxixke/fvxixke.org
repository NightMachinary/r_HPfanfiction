Doesn't really matter for these stories.

99% of Molly-bashing authors see enough justification to make Molly a potion-happy gold-digger based on her story about making a love-potion in her youth (which is treated as a ha-ha-I-was-dumb-as-a-kid moment in universe), confusing the names of her near-identical twin sons when they're deliberately trying to confuse her, and her talking about Platform 9Â¾ in front of muggles.

"If you give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest of men, I will find something in them which will hang him." That quote applies to character-bashing as much as anything - anything a character does wrong, or is /thought/ to do wrong, will be mercilessly exploited by people looking to add more cheap conflict to a fic.
