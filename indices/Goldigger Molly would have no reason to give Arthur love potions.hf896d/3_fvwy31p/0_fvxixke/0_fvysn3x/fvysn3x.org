Most of the Molly bashing I have seen rarely mentions gold digging (at least as it relates to Arthur) and is almost solely revolving around her being wildly overbearing and meddlesome and controlling. Which, to a point, she is. Maybe not as bad as the bashing fics make out, but to some degree, those are accurate descriptions if her character, regardless of whether it is "out of love" or not.

Most of these fics usually manifest in her doing everything to push a Harry/Ginny marriage (I dislike Hinny as a couple).
