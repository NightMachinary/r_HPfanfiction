I've read a bunch of Weasley bashing and only read one where Molly was like this. It was something about her liking control but also she liked being able to stay at home as well and if Arthur left her then she'd have to find a job or husband and that was too much effort. Also she had a reputation and she wasn't going to let him divorce her cuz it would look bad. I think she genuinely liked him and wasn't in it for the money but I can't remember too well. She also schooled Ginny in the same thing with love potions and fertility potions so Ginny could use them on Harry but thankfully that didn't work out of course and Molly was caught. I think Ginny ended up in St Mungo's but I'm not one hundred percent sure. It was a great read and I totally didn't expect it. Haven't read a book like it since.
