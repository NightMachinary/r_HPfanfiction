In some fanfics, it was shown that the Weasely family was rich and in the books it suggests that seeing how they were in the Sacred Twenty Eight but they're so poor in the books you say NorseHeimdall how cold they have been rich? in most fanfics concerning the Weasely family the usual reason is that Arthur Weasleys father gambled away most of their money Now none of this is confirmed but it seems that it is the general consensus
