For Riddle, the love potion used was the strongest love potion in existence, it seems there's a large range of them, hence why the twins were selling them in their store, low level love potions might be used in the wizarding world as a form of social lubrication, I've seen one example in stories of someone using a love potion on themself to give them the confidence to speak to their crush.
