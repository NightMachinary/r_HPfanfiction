.......Yes. I understand that. That's what I've been saying and agreeing with. Sorry, I'm probably just not making myself clear enough.

Back when that whole love potion thing first came out, the was a lot of debate, before it was generally agreed that Voldemort /must/ be emotionally crippled because of his father being potioned to the gills.

The entire reason that old conversation was brought up was because it's what really got Weasley Bashers to not only bash Ron, but Molly as well, for being "as evil as Tommy's mommy."

Of course, then Rowling cleared up the nonsense, but by then the "evil Molly" stick was firmly in hand of all Weasley haters, ready to be used against the dead horse known as "bashing."

I never said retcon, only that she cleared up the misconception. Now I'd very much appreciate it if you stopped attempting to argue with me when I'm agreeing with you.
