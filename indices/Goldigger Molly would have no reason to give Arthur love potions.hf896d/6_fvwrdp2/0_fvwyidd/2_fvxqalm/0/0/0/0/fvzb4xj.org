Same difference. She had to go back /because/ she was asked about it. That's how Q&As work.

And there was enough to make a big enough implication that it became readily accepted as canon before she was asked and said "that's not the case."

The biggest "clue" that I recall accepting as proof positive was Dumbledore's insistence that Tom jr didn't understand love. The way it was put sounded less "he's emotionally stunted" and more "he's a born sociopath." Perhaps myself and a million other readers misunderstood that, but sadly that is something artists and authors deal with all the time: fans who think they get what's going on when there's nothing going on.
