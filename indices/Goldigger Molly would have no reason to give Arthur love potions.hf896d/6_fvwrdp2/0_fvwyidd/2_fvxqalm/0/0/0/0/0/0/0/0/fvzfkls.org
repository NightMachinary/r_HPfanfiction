Yes. That was what I was saying. Fans found small, meaningless details, and combined them with two major facts ("Riddle Sr was fed potions" and "Riddle Jr doesn't understand love") while ignoring another major fact (Riddle grew up in an orphanage) and everyone decided 2+2=fish.

Let me reiterate: we're on the same side of this debate. This information was brought up not as some form of "fact" but as the reasoning behind a couple of the fandom's dumber headcanons, the Evil Molly one in particular.
