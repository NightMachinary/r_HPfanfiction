No no, I agree. I was simply saying there's more /shiptease/ between Harry and Hermione than Harry and Ginny. Going from Hermione, there's loads of tease between her and Ron. Looking at only the small selection of guys available to Second-Best Girl, Hermione's ship rankings would be:

â˜†1 Ron 2 Harry 2.5 Krum 3 Neville ... 47 Lockhart ... 7,000,999,998 Draco 7,000,999,999 Voldy

Just like with Hinny, Harmony doesn't have much chemistry. It'd just be an easier pill to swallow because at least there was a foundation, even if it was pockmarked.
