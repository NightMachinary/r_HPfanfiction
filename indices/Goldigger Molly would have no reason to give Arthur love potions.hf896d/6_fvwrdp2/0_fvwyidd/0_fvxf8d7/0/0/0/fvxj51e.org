Wow, have to disagree, and I am not even a harmony shipper. Canon H/HR is the most well built relationship in the series. There are very few examples of Harry not valuing HR; setting the romantic undertone completely aside, that you would say their friendship is flawed makes me wonder what books you were reading.

How about this instead: is there any relationship (romantic or platonic) in canon that comes near the devotion and loyalty H/HR show each other?
