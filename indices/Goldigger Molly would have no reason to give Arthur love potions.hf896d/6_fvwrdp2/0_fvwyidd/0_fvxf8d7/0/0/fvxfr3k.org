While I do have to admit that Hinny doesn't have the canon development it probably should have, I disagree with your statement about Harmony. While there is definitely affection there, Harry is shown repeatedly ignoring and not putting value into Hermione's ideas. Their friendship is very flawed and I don't feel that a romantic relationship would be sustainable for very long.
