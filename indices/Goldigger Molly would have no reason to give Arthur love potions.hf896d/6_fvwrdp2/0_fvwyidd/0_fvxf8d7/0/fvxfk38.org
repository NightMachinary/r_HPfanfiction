I'd agree, but I've never been able to get behind Hinny in the first place. Even though there's much less shiptease between Harry and Hermione than the movies, there's still a much greater basis for a relationship there than Harry and Ginny have. I'd argue that Luna has had more interaction with Harry than Ginny.

Of course, there have been fics where Ginny/Harry is splendidly done, but the canon reasons just don't really add up for ne, since there's very little chemistry.

Which, again, is why a bit of potioneering is such an easy target to hit for any and all Weasley bashers.
