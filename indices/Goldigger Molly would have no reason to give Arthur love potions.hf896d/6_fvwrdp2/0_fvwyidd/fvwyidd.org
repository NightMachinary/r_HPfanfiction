Yeah, she jokes about using love potions, which at the time most people were like "that sounds a bit off-color for Molly, but alright," and then we're told Riddle's backstory, that love potions are basically all date rape drugs combined, and that those born from such a horrifically broken facsimile of "love" are themselves incapable of love and empathy.

Now, seeing that all the Weasley kids are well adjusted, it's rather obvious that if she ever potioned Arthur, she stopped before any of their kids were born.

For me, this lets ne enjoy a story where Molly either potions Harry/ Hermione, or encourages Ginny/Ron to do so because of the sheer "what if?" factor. I don't recall any point where she was shown to be a gold digger, however.
