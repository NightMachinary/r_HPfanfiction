Apparently one of the biggest contributions (I was pretty against Molly Weasley from canon, so I asked why people liked her and got some really interesting answers) is her whole "They're just children, don't tell them anything!" approach. Expecting Harry not to get into trouble after two years of shit was pretty self-delusional, but after that thread I stopped blaming her for it.

Also, the whole 'my husband does what he loves, I do what I love, Percy does what he loves, Bill does what he loves, Charlie does what he loves, but the Twins absolutely cannot under any circumstances open their shop that they've apparently been saving and building for' thing. That seems somewhat of a disjoint for most, but I can see the other side of the argument as well.

So, yeah. Rereading your message, you're pretty much right. Arthur was very non-confrontational, whereas she was interfering with everything in sight at every opportunity. I know I'd react real badly to that kind of parenting, even if I knew it came from a place of affection and care.
