I don't know where you get your info on most teenagers having daddy issues, but likely the reason we see more Molly bashing than Arthur bashing is that Molly had a more rounded character- she argued with other characters and wasn't a mary sue. She also had more lines and a bigger place in the story. Arthur was less confrontational, often away at work, and was mostly mentioned second hand rather than having his own scenes. Also there's probably sexism mixed in there from some authors- sometimes authors don't even realise they're holding every flaw against female characters while not looking that closely at the men.
