/What he had pictured in his head when he'd first thought of teaching were long, sweeping orations, students hanging on his every word, young minds being taken in and inspired by his message. What he did not fully consider, however, was that he would actually have to teach. (In which Tom Riddle begins teaching at Hogwarts and realizes just what a horribly stupid idea it was.)/

No romance at least none so far Tom Riddle despite being smart can't logic himself through everything and does need help at times so the supporting cast is very relevant later on and are all fleshed out and he works well off them. It has alot of comedy moments with Tom just being a teacher in the first half but gets more serious with a kinda creepy mystery in the second half and handles the tonal shift well.

/Fred opened the book and began to write. He only got a few words down before the diary absorbed them, the ink vanishing without a trace, prompting George to lean in closer to observe. “Maybe this is some elaborate joke on Ginny's part to educate us on proper brotherly behaviour?” George mused, just as new words began to appear on the empty page. Well, that seemed a bit ambitious for a first-year... ‘Hello. May I know who I am conversing with?'/

AU where Fred and George find Tom Riddle's diary instead of Ginny its pretty cracky with some drama and while they do encounter the major plot points its actually not very heavily focused on that and often the situations are altered because it's Fred George and Tom focused. But it's more about what Fred George and Tom do outside of those plot points they often have their own motivations and project and the hp main plot is more a thing they sometimes have to handle.

Neither are complete but neither currently leave you hanging or on a cliff hanger and so far both authors seem to be updating regularly.
