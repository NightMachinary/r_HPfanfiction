Harry Potter and the Rotfang Conspiracy by SmuttyPlotWizard

Summary:

#+begin_quote
  During the summer before his sixth year, Harry reflects on the death of his Godfather, Sirius Black, and decides that it's time to fight back. If it's war Voldemort wants, it's war he will get! (Assuming Harry's raging teenage hormones don't distract him, that is.) An occasionally X-rated (NC17-rated in the US) novel-length Honks re-write of Half-Blood Prince that's about 80% plot, 10% humour and 10% smut. The smut doesn't really take off until Chapter 7. Independent!Harry. Proactive!Harry.

It's on AO3. It's Harry/Tonks. I didn't share a link because story includes smut and Harry is 16.
