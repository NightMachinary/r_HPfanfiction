Thanks for letting me know, I'm actually the author of the fic so I was curious.

It's interesting that it came across that way because it's absolutely not what I intended.

The selective mutism stems from an incident where she was forced to swallow bleach by Petunia.

The sexual abuse is separate and did not cause the selective mutism. The third fic will detail that more clearly, but I didn't realize I was giving the impression that something like that had happened. Thanks for clarifying.
