I feel like and this will probably come off as broken but I really like how the trauma is explored and how she works herself up RIGHT after the beginning of it is shown I feel like basically(is could be misremembering here BTW haven't read first book in almost a month now) But its like we find out she was sexually abused?? I think we see her in the Snape scene i assume you've seen it right and how Snape has to correct her ok but then I'm pretty sure there was something about the throat and chemicals maybe(my recollection is shit tbh I should reread) and then in ny head I'm like was she raped was she punished by being told to get naked what happened with chemicals,choking idk that made her go mute from what I recall the trauma is a bit unclear which to me makes it weird(could be remembering wrong still) but in my eyes I'm picturing somebody who wanted sexual trauma then decided hey I also want her to be mute due to trauma then fuck it i cant decide what made her mute so ill be vauge it might have been cleared up in the counseling sessions(I love that lady) but that's exactly why its the start of it sorry if I wasn't clear sorry for long post sorry for no fucking grammar bye
