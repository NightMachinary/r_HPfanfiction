I could of honestly have written this note myself [[/u/rowii]]

I have fought severe depression and anxiety all my life, and one thing that has always helped me cope and avoid becoming worse and perhaps suicidal is to spend some time escaping into different worlds within my head, often either through gaming or my own art and writing. However most recently (the last few years) many of my escapes have been into the world of fan fiction (mainly HP fan fiction).

Its always amazing to read the stories of the incredible FF writers here and elsewhere and explore the ideas they come up with. To laugh, love, experience and learn along with them, and at times even explore darker emotions.

Good for you for finding such an outlet. I would encourage you to explore your own artistic/creative side as well (we all have one.. it might just not be an obvious one). From one to another... it does help.
