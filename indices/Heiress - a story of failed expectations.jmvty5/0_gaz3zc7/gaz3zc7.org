I took a peek. Its well written and I have no complaints about your style. Character is believable but be cautious falling into the 11 year old who behaves and thinks like an adult trap.

There's not too much to day, just because there's not much written. I don't see a draw yet but I'd probably keep reading to the next chapter anyway.
