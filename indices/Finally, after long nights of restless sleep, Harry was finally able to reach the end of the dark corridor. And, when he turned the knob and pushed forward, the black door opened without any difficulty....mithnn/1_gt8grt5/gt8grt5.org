This is a really nice prompt. I can see how someone could make a nice wholesome fic out of it.

I can also see potential for a more darker turn: Voldemort /did/ survive. But because every single person affiliated with him was found out and had gotten sent to Azkaban or put to death, there were no rumors of his return.

Maybe Slughorn managed to successfully fool Dumbledore with his modified memory. Dumbledore never suspected that Voldemort survived.

As such, Quirrell had no reason to seek out Voldemort and he never got possesed.

Eventually Voldemort does manage to possess someone and does return, starting the process of rebuilding his forces. Harry sees the writing on the wall, he's lived in it before. He knows how it looks like. But no one really believes him. And then, when Voldemort strikes, everyone is completely unprepared to face him. The situation goes to shit and now they have to scramble to prepare and to defend themselves against his attacks.
