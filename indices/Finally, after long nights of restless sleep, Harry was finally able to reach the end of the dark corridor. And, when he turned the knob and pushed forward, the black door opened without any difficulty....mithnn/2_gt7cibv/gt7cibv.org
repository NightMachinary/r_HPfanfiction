This reminded me of an story that I read a while ago.

In it a teenager and her friends found an underwater cave when they were diving in a cruise. As they follow the cave, they found an old temple with a great library with hundreds of books in it.

Long story short, they unknowlingly free an ancient parasite sentient species that feed on the memories and sanity of humans, tyrning them into a hive mind zombies. They manage to escape unharmed (or so they thought) and escape to the surface.

The parasite quickly spread around the world when they discover that one of their friends had been replaced by a "Queen" parasite. After a few weeks of losing against the parasite, the protagonist returns to the temple and finds a book with unlimited information from every dimension.

When she opens it, she loses consciousness and she wakes up in a mental hospital with her friends visiting her and keeping her company. Turns out she had suffer from a nervous breakdown before they left for their cruise ship and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia with small moments of temporary sanity.

However, the next day she wakes up in the temple with the open book and finds herself once more in the world about to be overrun by the parasite. Later on, she discovers that everything did happen, she had simply travel to another dimension. She uses this new ability of traveling back and forth between dimensions to battle the parasite.
