Harry not able to believe anything happening, had a suspicion in the back of his mind, so in typical Gryffindor brashness he decided to ask professor Dumbledore who was watching him with keen concerned eyes. "Professor is there a door with "DOM" branded on it's doorknob? I don't know where it is, but I think I opened that door after dreaming of it many times and there were rows and rows of wooden shelves with strange glittering blue orbs sitting on them. There was some strange stuff swirling in them.

I was in front of row number 97, when I touched the orb in front of me that had my name on it. But it slipped out of my hands because it was warm to the touch, and it fell on the floor and an etheral voice started saying something but in my surprise, I knocked a tall shelf behind me and it toppled all the other shelves like a big Domino , and all the orbs started falling and breaking and there was this strange stuff all over me which was inside the orbs. The last thing I remember is this really strange voice saying the phrase, "he will have the power the dark lord knows not, for neither can live while the other survives...."

At this Dumbledore paled and looked at Harry strangely with his steely blue eyes missing their usual twinkle and warmth. "Harry how did you came into this information? No-one and I mean no-one knows this part of the prophecy, for I was the only one who heard it. And I have shared this with no-one, what with Voldemort being killed."

"Have you listened to the prophecy Harry? Come to think about it, how do you even know of its existence?"

Harry just looked on with confusion and only replied with a shrug if his shoulders. Dumbledore looked at Harry with even more intensity and hummed to himself. At this Ron told Dumbledore of the strange conversation that he had between himself and Harry. "Would you indulge me for a moment Harry?" asked Dumbledore. When Harry answered in affirmative he continued. "Tell me something strange or informative thing if you think that Voldemort is alive." "Well", Harry said after a moment of hesitation. "You reformed the Order of the Phoenix again and also recruited some new members to face off the challenge of voldemort. But I will not name them. The former members are Mad eye moody, Remus Lupin, Dedalus Diggle, Emmaline Vance, Arthur and Molly Weasley, Sirius Black, Edgar Bones, Frank and Alice Longbottom, Fabian and Gideon Prewett, Arabella Figg, Mundungus Fletcher and last but not the least Minerva McGonagall", finished Harry. At this Dumbledore's eyes had widened. But Harry continued on. "I also know the entrance to the chamber of secrets and the fabled monster is a basilisk. The heir to Slytherin is Lord Voldemort which is a stupid anagram of 'TOM MARVOLLO RIDDLE'. I also know that Riddle Manor is in a village called Little Hangelton and not far from there is a graveyard where lies the tomb of Lord Voldemort's father Tom riddle senior."

Dumbledore had sat down in the chair near his bed and told Harry to continue with his story. Harry had deliberately mentioned these facts to all these people to prove them that he knew all these things and if according to them Lord Voldemort was vanquished that fateful night on Halloween and Lucious Malfoy was not present during the COS fiasco, then he could not have fabricated these things on his own and he was not getting mad and was telling the truth. "Also for further proof you can check that Bartemius Crouch Junior is not dead like you all believe and is instead hidden under an invisiblity cloak and held under the imperious curse by his father Crouch senior. Crouch Junior was replaced by his mother who couldn't stand her single child locked in Azkaban and persuaded Crouch senior to let her impersonate her son using polyjuice and replace him from his cell. And the plan succeeded." A shocked looking Dumbledore then stood up and told everyone that he was going to check all these facts and see if his suspicion about Harry was true.

After an hour Harry just sat calmly when a shell shocked headmaster returned and informed everybody that what Harry said was true and both of the Crouch were arrested by DMLE and they were working on further investigation.

In the end after much deliberation and arguing it was settled that this Harry Potter was a dimension traveller from another Dimension where Voldemort was still alive, and Harry had accidentally came to their dimension during the accident in Department of mysteries where he had accidentally destroyed all of the prophecies and the supercharged magical matter had transferred Harry into their's Dimensional Harry Potter's body. . .

Harry very easily settled into his new carefree life with just a small amount of guilt for this Dimension's poor Harry who had travelled to his dimension and would now have to stand against a suddenly restored Dark Lord who he must have thought dead and who also was hell bent on killing him. He also felt pity for him, because unlike him the other Harry had not had any experience of life and death situations as his life was not in peril at the end of every year. But with a shrug of his shoulders Harry thanked the fates or whoever was up there, for once in a lifetime giving him some good fortune. All was well.
