I can imagine a story like this with Tomarry.

Voldemort died but as a punishement for cheating death, he can't go to the afterlife and is forced to follow his ancient vessel as a ghost/spirit for eternity, under his teenager form. Kinda like Ryuk.

Maybe Immortal Master of Death Harry would be great for this fic.

Tom teasing Harry for getting consumed by the darkness and Harry teasing Tom because he became the Dark Lord Tom could only dream to become.

Everyone being conscious of the fact that what makes Harry infinitely more lethal than Voldemort ever was is that Harry isn't afraid of Death.

He would rather not to but he is willing to die if it means breaking his arch-nemesis' no killing rule.
