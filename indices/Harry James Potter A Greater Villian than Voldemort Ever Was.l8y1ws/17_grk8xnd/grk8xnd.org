I hope you're still looking for recommendations! I saved this on mobile a month ago hoping to come back when I had time. I can't recommend anything that exactly fits your request, but I'll explain why I recommended each and where the rec fails to meet your request so you can decide if it's worth your time.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/839169][The Uncle]] is a little similar to the one recommended by [[/u/Kathema1]]. Remus isn't given room to flourish at Hogwarts and becomes a crime lord. He adopts Harry as his protege. The summary reads: "Remus had the Dursleys whacked. Tactfully, of course, and well after Harry left the house."
- I haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5778006/1/Smoke-and-Mirrors][Smoke and Mirrors]] in ages, but I remember genuinely enjoying it. Basically, Harry is a street kid who grows up in Muggle gangs. If memory serves, he becomes a lieutenant or higher in a criminal organization (complete)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1847353/1/Tread-Softly][Tread Softly]] is about Harry's transformation into the exact character you described. This is pretty old.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is an extremely imaginative AU that is updated pretty frequently. I enjoyed this so much I read the author's crossover with Naruto. I don't even watch anime. I'm a little hesitant to recommend it because I think it has a different feel than you're looking for. It doesn't feel very dark. Lily's name isn't spoken under breaths. However, she gives precisely zero fucks about what people think is "ethical" or "just". Also, the general public is terrified of her, they just don't recognize her based on her nom de guerre.

Happy reading!
