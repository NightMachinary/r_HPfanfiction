I can't remember what these are called, hopefully someone can name them for me. Firstly a post Battle of Hogwarts fic where Harry can't die due to already 'missing his train' and is also missing part of his soul due to being hit by the killing curse as a baby, leading to insanity.

The second was a Vampire! Harry where vampires are more the Hellsing or Castlevania kind, complete with increadibly visceral descriptions of massacres and torture. He had a harem with Luna and Hermione as well as a few other women (can't remember who), but he'd twisted them into dark abominations of themselves. I think Luna was the torturer, for example.
