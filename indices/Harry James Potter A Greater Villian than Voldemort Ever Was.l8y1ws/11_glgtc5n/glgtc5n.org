Not exactly what you asked for but it is a great Dark!Harry story that I will not stop recommending. It's a trilogy and a star wars crossover. Although this takes place centuries before the prequels.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Power of the Dark Side by Faykan)

Linkffn(The Rise of Darth Veneficus by Faykan)

Linkffn(Order among chaos by Faykan)
