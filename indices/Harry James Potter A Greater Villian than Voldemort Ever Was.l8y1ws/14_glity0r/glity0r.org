There's a pretty good alternate universe one out there in which Tom Riddle is the BWL, Bellatrix and Lucius are his friends, and Harry is the Dark Lord (who Dumbledore opposes), and canon Harry gets shoved into the mix (while his AU counterpart is still waging war with his followers, including many of our other Light heroes). I just can't remember the name or author. Everything is flipped: purebloods are oppressed and Harry is the champion of Muggleborns (but I think he was anti-Muggle). Harry's parents died in Grindewald's War (birth dates are messed with--Dark Lord Harry is older than young Tom).
