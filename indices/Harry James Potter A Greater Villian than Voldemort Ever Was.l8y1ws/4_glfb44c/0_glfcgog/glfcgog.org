Most of the Dark Harry that I have found usually fall in one of two places: He joins Voldemort in some way or he is part of the "Light" faction with several conflicts.

I am looking for a Harry that has unknowlingly created his own side. I like the idea that there is no good or bad factions, just ideas that can be taken to the extremes.

There have been some extremely well written fics that explore the idea of the "Pureblood" and "Dark" ideology and potrays them as people who wish to conserve their culture, but some bad apples are extremists or criminals and results in the Death Eater movement (Novocaine).

The villian Harry that I am looking for is not good or bad, his ideology just happens to result in the devastation of the Wizarding world.
