I think it's kind of stupid when in most of the evil harry fics, they just have harry join voldemort, and become his servant. why? It's like one cannot be evil unless they join ole voldy boy. If I became evil supervillain I wouldn't join another villain as a underling I would help the hero defeat the villain so I could be the best
