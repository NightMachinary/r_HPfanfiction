I once read a story where Harry went to Hufflepuff and was their lord. It was short, and set during Triwizard Tournament where he meets Voldemort in the cemetery, laughs all of, and gives his blood willingly to have some fun. Can't recall the name but it was written by one of the more well known ao3 writers!
