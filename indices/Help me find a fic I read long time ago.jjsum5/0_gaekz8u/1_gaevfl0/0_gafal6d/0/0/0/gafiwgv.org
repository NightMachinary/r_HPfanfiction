Ah cool. Yeah I realise now how confused i was. Still cant find the fic i was thinking of. At first i checked DLP and could only find Darkly Dreaming Harry. There is a fic where Harry just knows things. It starts during the dursleys and he is just innately feared by his peers bcos he knows things he shouldnt. That is what confused me - I was remembering his knowledge of secrets.

Anyway, for outsiders, antithesis is NOT a sociopath or godlike harry fic at all. It is extremely well written and arguably one of the best if not the best in its genre. I would highly recommend it though prepare for potential waterworks if I remember my reaction to the final few chapters. Definitely recommend it.
