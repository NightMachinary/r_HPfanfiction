It gets really messed up man. Especially near the end of his 5th year. There are whole chapters dedicated to brutally torturing some characters in the most screwed up ways. I ended up having to skip some of the portions because it was actually sickening. Also the series as a whole is just depressing to read without any real uplifting/light hearted parts. Easily the most fucked up fic I've read by a huge margin.

There are some killer worldbuilding ideas in there though, especially starting around book 5, and the sequel is A1. So good. Especially if you've read his other fic.
