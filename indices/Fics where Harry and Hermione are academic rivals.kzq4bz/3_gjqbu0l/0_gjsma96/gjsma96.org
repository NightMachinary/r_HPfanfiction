I don't think that fic is the best depiction of a meaningful rivalry though. It's very one-sided in Victoria's favor, and most of their interactions is just a way to show to the reader how much better Victoria is than Hermione. In almost every interaction, Victoria is the correct one, and Hermione is the only who has to learn from her "mistakes". The author even adds flaws to Hermione's character to make Victoria seem better:

1. *Homework:*

#+begin_quote
  Snape unfurled the scroll and held it in front of himself, his eyes skimming rapidly over the text. "I am not accustomed to having my instructions ignored, Miss Granger, and yet this is the third time you have exceeded the specified length. From now on, I shall be enforcing these requirements strictly."

  He then raised his wand and slid it across the parchment at a length of ten inches. Hermione gasped as the bottom half of the essay floated to the floor.

  "Told you so," Victoria whispered as Snape moved away.

In canon, Hermione is never described as writing longer than required in any subject besides history, and I don't think Binns really cares. She's described as writing tiny to fit everything in, but she can hardly be punished for that.

  "Granger, you've basically copied the textbook out line by line," Victoria said, comparing the two side by side. Oh, Hermione's words were different, but the information was all the same, exactly as it was in the textbook.
#+end_quote

In canon, Hermione was literally shown to do extra research so she could explain certain topics more in depth on her homework. She also outlined her essays, which would suggest that she didn't formulate it in the same manner.

1. *Arrogance:*

#+begin_quote
  As the lesson drew to a close, Victoria was the only one who had managed a complete transfiguration. To her annoyance, however, Hermione Granger also came very close, making her matchstick grey and pointy and sending Victoria a smug look.
#+end_quote

Hermione wasn't very intentionally smug in canon, and was mostly just trying to help everybody even though her lack of social skills made it seem like the opposite. In this fic, Hermione is sending smug looks at Victoria for... what reason? This was the first day of class, so she never even interacted with Victoria, but she already dislikes her?

#+begin_quote
  "Finally here, are you?" Hermione said, moving some books to make room for Victoria. "Well, I've already done most of it. I suppose you'll want to copy me."
#+end_quote

Hermione doesn't even let Ron and Harry copy her until OotP.

#+begin_quote
  Victoria rolled her eyes. This was exactly why she'd been dreading working with Hermione: she had this irritating habit of assuming she was the only person who was interested in studying.
#+end_quote

This is the same girl who gave Harry a homework planner as a present, and put Ron and Harry on a rigorous study schedule so they could pass their exams?

1. *Intelligence:*

This doesn't even need to be said. In canon, Hermione is prized for her logical ability and intelligence. She breaks into Slytherin's common room, solves a 1000 year old mystery, figures out that Lupin is a werewolf, figures out that Rita Skeeter is a beetle animagus, manipulates Umbridge into banning the Quibbler so more people would read it, recognizes that Harry's vision is probably a trick, tricks Umbridge into getting kidnapped by the centaurs, and more. One would expect Victoria Potter's Hermione to have similar intelligence, but instead, she's possibly the dumbest character I've ever seen in a fanfic (exaggeration, but you get the point). She's unable to figure out simple riddles (it's pretty easy to deduce that Mars means getting angry), gets manipulated using extremely basic manipulation tactics, and can't deduce anything not contained in a book. She's not Hermione. She's a caricature of Hermione.

There are other examples of flaws that the author added to Hermione (her aggression, her extreme competitiveness, etc.), but those were the ones I thought off the top of my head. I get that the author wants to establish Victoria as a Dumbledore-level prodigy and wanted to use Hermione, who is generally regarded as an intelligent and talented character, as a measuring tool to show the readers how powerful and great Victoria is, but worsening Hermione's character wasn't the correct way to do so IMO.
