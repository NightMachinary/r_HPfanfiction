And yet, even with all of that, it's /less/ bash-happy and more meaningful than 99.99999% of fics with similar situations.

Hermione's usually the one in the wrong /between the two/, but she's still consistently second-place in most classes, and occasionally when the two are /not forced to work together/, Hermione is shown to pick something up faster than Victoria does. They do spur each other on at times, rather than it /purely/ being about "Victoria's so much better than Hermione".

That alone means she's in a better position than most "Smart Harry" fics, hence my recommendation. It's not perfect, but it's the best I can find that's still a good story overall.
