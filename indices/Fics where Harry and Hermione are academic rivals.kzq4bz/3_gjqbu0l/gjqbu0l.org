I will never not recommend Victoria Potter to people looking for Smart!Protagonist fics: linkao3(13795605)

She gets an academic rivalry with Hermione in classes, including occasionally correcting each other's work and finding the other annoying for it.

Both are actual /characters/ - both Victoria and Hermione have their flaws, but neither is /bashed/ per se. They're just... Kids who tolerate each other's presence for the sake of getting the highest Potions grades. I also like that they both have to /work/ for it - they're smart kids, but they're still kids who need to actually learn stuff.
