Yeah. Sadly. This is a caricature of sixth year, when Rowling does make Hermione a prat. I mean, calling someone learning from a book 'cheating'? Would it not have been cheating if he'd picked up pointers from the library instead of notes in margins?

It comes off as Hermione being upset Harry was doing better than her. Which is odd, as she didn't mind him being better than her in Defense.

Granted, yelling at him for testing spells he has no clue about is totally valid.
