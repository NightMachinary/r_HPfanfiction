I think a lot of it is [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality][protagonist-centred morality]]: anyone who criticises the protagonist on an ethical matter /must/ be in the wrong.

In a modern Western school or university, what Harry did would be considered cheating---specifically, plagiarism. Let's be generous to Harry and suppose that there was no restriction on the sources a student could use in the task. Then, Harry still used a source that was not a standard reference and failed to cite it, thus misrepresenting someone else's work as his own. Indeed, when he was publicly given credit by a teacher for inventing the improvement to the recipe, he failed to disclose that the work was not his, thus lying by omission.

Now, it's not unlikely that there are no rule against that in Hogwarts, but you can see how it's unethical, which Hermione called out. Indeed, Harry offers to share the HBP book at one point, and she refuses.

Also, the point about spells Harry has no clue about also applies to the potions. Harry is not qualified to assess whether Half-Blood Prince's instructions are safe and complete without actually attempting them. Snape could have easily omitted some step that would have been obvious to him but not to Harry, and then who knows what would have happened?
