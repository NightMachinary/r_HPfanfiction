I think that trope arises because different attitudes towards vulnerability. I was number 1 in my high school class and a girl was number 2. She worked incredibly hard and she made sure everyone else knew it. I was taking extra classes online, staying up past midnight most nights finishing school work, reading ahead in the textbooks, the works. And I kept my mouth shut about it. There's more of a stigma about complaining about how rough a dude has it so we just never do it.

The effortless genius male myth comes about because advertising effort resembles weakness and we can't stand it.
