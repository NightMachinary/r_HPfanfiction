And yet people thought Sheldon was entertaining enough to get his own childhood spinoff series. Just because this isn't your cup of tea doesn't mean other people can't legitimately find it entertaining and benefit from having it recommended. The downvote button is not a 'dislike' button. I would only criticize that long and old fics like HPMOR get recommended too often. It's like recommending The Dark Knight to a batman fan - they've likely already heard of it.
