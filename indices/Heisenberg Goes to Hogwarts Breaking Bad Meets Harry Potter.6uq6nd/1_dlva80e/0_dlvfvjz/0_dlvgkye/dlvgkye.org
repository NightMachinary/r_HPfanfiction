Well. Don't I feel silly.

Sorry, man.

If I can, when you've posted work elsewhere under a different name, it's really helpful to point that out so assholes like me don't come out of the wood work. <3

EDIT: Just for clarification, can you point out where that blog posts indicates you're the author?
