Ignore what Rowling said about America. Her world building barely makes sense in the UK, France and Iberia and already starts to fall apart when you cross into Germany or Italy. Make up your own world instead.

Maybe some purebloods used the Muggle Civil War as a pretence for a power grab and won against the magical Union, even if the South lost the real war. Since the magical one was about power and not slavery, you'd have a bunch of Southern +Malfoys+ Snobs running the country. Or maybe the Canadians took over the magical US. Maybe there is no Union at all, but several nations based on former colonial dominion (Dutch New York, Spanish Florida, French Louisiana, Russian Alaska).
