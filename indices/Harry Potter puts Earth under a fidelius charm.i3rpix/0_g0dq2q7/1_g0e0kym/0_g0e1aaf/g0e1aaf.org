It is, especially the first five to ten chapters as things get started. After that it seems to start moving towards a distant outlook with plans and plots that might not be finished till 5-10 more chapters down the road. Good thing is the author is still updating and doesn't seem to be slowing down so the story should actually get to a point of completion.
