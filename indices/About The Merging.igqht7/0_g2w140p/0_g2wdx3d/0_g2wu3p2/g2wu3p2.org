Damn, I knew something was missing cause I distinctly remembered the Su Li scene when Harry says something like "my magic doesn't work in the mornings." I'm not a huge fan of the changes as you described, I think HP on the whole is built on the little moments of wonder and exploration and those are all gone now, it makes the story feel less alive.

I still greatly enjoyed it after re-reading it when the new chapters came out, hopefully there's more coming to keep fleshing it out.
