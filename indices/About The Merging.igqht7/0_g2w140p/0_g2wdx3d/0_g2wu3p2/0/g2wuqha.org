Exactly, I was saying to a friend that the story is "prettier" Now but it lost part of it's personality. There were a lot of small things that I loved on this fic that now don't exist

I still love it though, I'm re-reading right now, but I just feel a little sad with a lot of this small moments that I really liked before
