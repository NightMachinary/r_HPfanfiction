He is editing little by little for a good time, so I don't know exactly when your read it the first time, but some of them from the first time I read are :

- No more magic suppressing potion,be it on Hogwarts or sirius house, so te training could be all day.

- The first Daphne a Tracy scene on the ice cream shop is gone.

- Took out the scene of him discovering his "felling people's magic ability" With Hermione and Ginny. He just have it know, no build up.

- Lots of small interactions with Tonks on the summer was taken off (is it the right way to write?), like the clothes shopping.

- Harry's detention with McGonagall was changed to the rune's teacher and Tracy.

- After that most of it is just he changing the things to reflect the mentioned alterations (like: how there is no more suppressing magic potion, his scene with Su Li on charms make no more sense) .

- Oh and of course ( I agree 100% with this one, but it is a change) the dimensional trip was transformed into an omake.

There is some more, but most of them are just pretty small or I just don't remember. A lot of the changes were just to clean the story up, but there was a lot of them that didn't make a lot of sense to me and that are, mainly, the ones I want to discuss about.

Edit: sorry for the awful formatting, I'm on the phone
