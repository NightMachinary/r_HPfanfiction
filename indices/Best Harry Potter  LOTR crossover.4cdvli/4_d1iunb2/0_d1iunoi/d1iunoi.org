  After the Second Wizarding War, Harry goes to Middle Earth for a little R&R away from it all. He was told it was peaceful. He was wrong. He then spends four years fighting in the North. When the Ring is discovered, a war for the sake of two worlds begins with Harry at it's centre. I own neither LOTR or Harry Potter and would be a good deal richer if I did. THE SEQUEL IS NOW UP.
