Yeah I read it, but I liked it a lot less. It's true that his portrayal of Saruman was very good, but I didn't like it as much. I know it's pretty weird, but...It just didn't felt like middle Earth to me, contrary to his other work. And I don't really like his Harry either, but it's indeniably well written. My dislike is more on the personal side of things.
