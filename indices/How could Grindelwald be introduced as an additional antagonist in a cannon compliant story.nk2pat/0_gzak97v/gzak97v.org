Voldemort most likely recruited some Dark wizards who had served Grindelwald. Judging by their names, Karkaroff and Dolohov might have been students of Durmstrang, so I'd say they are good choices for people who flocked behind whichever Dark wizard was the most powerful. How about if Karkaroff, instead of fleeing, breaks Grindelwald out of Nurmengard shortly after Voldemort's return in order to give Voldemort a rival and thus something else to do than hunting him down.
