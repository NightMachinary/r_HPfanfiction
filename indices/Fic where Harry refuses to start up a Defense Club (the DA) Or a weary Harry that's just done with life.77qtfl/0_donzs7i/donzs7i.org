That's actually canon: In HBP, despite Voldemort coming into the open and Harry knowing the real deal, he slacked off and disbanded DA very much to his friends' disappointment. Despite Dumbledore giving him almost a year to sink in, he forgot to ask how to destroy a Horcrux. Then he had holed up for an entire month at Dursleys and basically done zero preparations for his mission.
