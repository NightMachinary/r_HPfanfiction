If we try to look for an explanation in context (i.e disregarding the JK putting out shitty writing excuse), why did Harry behave that way during HBP?

A hypothesis I like is that he just stopped giving much of a shit. From the beginning of his fourth year to the end of his fifth, he was forced to consume one pile of shit after another, culminating in Sirius's death (which incidentally, he is never shown to actually deal with).

I can definitely see him subconsciously deciding simply... not to act, becoming numb, except by obsessing over Malfoy. This serves two dual purposes.

Firstly, his first act of true independence, getting his own group and storming the Ministry results in Sirius's death and his friends getting greviously injured. So there is merit in the mindset of every subsequent independent action having catastrophic results. In essence, by not acting, he is protecting his friends.

Secondly (and this is a part that Harry would not even admit to himself, I think), Voldemort is out there. Killing people. Striking against the greater wizardring public. A public that has been shitting on him for the past two years.

I really think that Harry doesn't give a fuck about them. I think he actively suppressed his own (potentially helpful) actions and was content to let the wizardring community crumble and fall back to the pattern of uncertainty and fear of the first war, as a measure of punishment for their behavior towards him. This, and his own dislike of the ministry, lead him to blow Scrimgeour off, much more than being "Dumbledore's man", I think.

Of course, the numbness shatters after Dumbledore's death. Because up to the point, the result of inaction was Harry being just another Hogwarts student. But after, not acting would lead to death and suffering for him and his loved ones. So, once again, it's personal for Harry. The fate of the wizarding world does not matter (and it's my personal opinion that it *never* mattered to him); the horcruxes /must/ be destroyed, because it's the only way Harry will be able to have any semblance of a life worth living.
