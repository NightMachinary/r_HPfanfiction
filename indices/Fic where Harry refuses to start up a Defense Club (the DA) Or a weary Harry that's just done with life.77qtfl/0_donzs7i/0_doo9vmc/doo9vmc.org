To be fair to Harry, it was Dumbledore's role as teacher to know what Harry needed to learn, and "how to destroy a horcrux" probably should have come first. For a man who knew when and how he was going to die, he did a shitty job prepping his hand picked successor in the fight against Voldemort. All it would have taken was Harry getting himself, Ron, and Hermione killed, as tends to come close to happening fairly frequently even before the war, and Voldemort would have won.

To be fair to Dumbledore, Harry was kind of an idiot. He made no effort to understand what Dumbledore was trying to explain to him, never asked for any pertinent details,never demanded more useful lessons, regularly got sidetracked, and was content to just kind of ignore the war for an entire school year outside of occasional lessons with Dumbledore.
