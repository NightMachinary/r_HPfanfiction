Well. There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2919503/1/Luna-s-Hubby][/Luna's Hubby/ by Meteoricshipyards]]. The firs chapter is by the same person who wrote /Make A Wish/(Rorchach's Blot). Apparently that little oneshot inspired Meteoricshipyards to make a full story out of it.

It's mostly fluffy. The only thing I really didn't like about it was the Bellatrix LeStrange subplot. It felt /way/ too forced...
