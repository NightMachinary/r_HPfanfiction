I tend to favour crack treated seriously and I'm not very good at picking one favourite so here are some fun ones:

Felix Felicis troubles: linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13499758/1/]])

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5761151/1/]])

Hagrid nonsense: linkffnet([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7512124/1/]]) (Hagrid reaches Harry occlumency)

Fantastic elves and where to find them Linkffnet([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/]]) (Harry gets abandoned as a small child and draws his own conclusions about his accidental magic)

No competition: linkffnet([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11126195/1/]]) (the horcrux in Harry's head brings a dark aura to privit drive, resulting in the suburb becoming home to a bunch of very protective people)
