You know what's worse than doing laundry? Putting nylon clothing into a blender, making a plastic smoothie, and dumping it in the ocean.

Creating a macro-horcrux is using spare energy from your washing machine to tear off a sleeve from your shirt. Fiendfyring or basilisk-venoming the horcrux is like blending the sleeve and dumping the smoothie in the ocean. No recycling here. Just extra microplastic when someone finally gets around to killing your horcrux.
