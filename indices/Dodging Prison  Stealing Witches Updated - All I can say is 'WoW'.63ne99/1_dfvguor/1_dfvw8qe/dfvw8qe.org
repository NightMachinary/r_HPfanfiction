I read it because of that. Once you step back and stop taking it so seriously it's the funniest shit ever. Seriously, the fuckin cabins of the train are divided up into light dark and grey and eeeeevil Potter traitor guy is giving a pep talk to the light first years about how important it is to convert the grey and it gets funnier every time I think about it because holy shit none of it makes sense for 11 year olds but it just compounds upon itself again and again.
