I could pretend I have something new to say so I will. He actually uses all the random obscure things he has rather than going "your a metamorphmagus and can change your physical body" followed by "my foot aches" and you are now "lord gryffindor slytherin ravenclaw le fay emrys dracula etc" then going "damn I'm broke". This combined with a good writing style and an intriguing if overused plot makes it fucking awesome despite the cliches. Besides I just want to see the comment counter go up.
