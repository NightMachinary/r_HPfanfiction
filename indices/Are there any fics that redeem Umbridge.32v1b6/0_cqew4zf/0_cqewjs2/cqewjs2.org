To me this one always seemed like a reply to the Snape apologists: "she's a giant cunt because she's a spy, so it's really all that evil shit she did is not that bad". It's obviously not true for either character. Also iirc this one ends in a sudden harem and I just ignore its existence when I discuss the quality of the story.
