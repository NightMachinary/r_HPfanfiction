I'm picturing a death eater dying because he didn't take cover.

"DUCK!" yelled Malfoy.

"I KNOW!" Nott screamed back, before dying in a mess of feathers, blood, and skull fragments.

EDIT TO ADD: if you're not picturing rocket-propelled kinetic-kill ducks as wearing little leather flying helmets and aviator goggles you're not doing it right.
