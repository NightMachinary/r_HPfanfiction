Honestly, this just reminds me of that part of /Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived/ where they briefly face duck based conquest.

  Calypso laughed and smiled softly at Harry. “Did he ever tell you about the duck incident when he was first learning how to make a receptacle for the space enhancement charm?”

  Harry felt his face suddenly pale. “Calypso, you and Viktor promised!”

  “I believe that you told us to never mention it; however, I don't think we ever agreed to anything.”

  Groaning, Harry sagged into his chair as Calypso began to tell the story. Glancing up, he couldn't help but notice the happy and grinning faces around the table. Compared to how the evening could have gone, a little embarrassment wasn't that bad.

  “... and then the ducks just start to multiply, and Harry screams, 'Go get Professor Kosarev before they take over!'”
