Heh, I skip any Harry/Daphne story. Can't stand the OC hype, especially if it goes with "The Death Eaters had a point; pureblood culture yay, mudblood values boo" attitude, and the "the Weasleys are barbarians, only a pureblood princess can teach Harry pureblood culture!!!" bashing.

But I've changed my opinions on pairings in the past, mostly because of the portrayal of the characters and ships. If you've read too many stories that bash Hermione and Ginny - and, as a Harry/Daphne fan, you probably have; both tend to be bashed in those stories - you might need to read stories where these two characters are portrayed favourably and - and this is important - the plot has a hook that still draws you in. Like "Growing up Kneazle" for Ginny, for example.
