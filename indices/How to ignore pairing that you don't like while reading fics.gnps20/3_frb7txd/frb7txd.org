I just don't read those fics. But then, I don't particularly care about pairings, one way or another, though I due tend to like “Lunar Harmony”

The only pairings I tend to avoid are slash with Harry, especially with significant age gaps. Remus/Sirius doesn't really bother me, but I'm not at all interested in Drarry or, ugh, Harry/Severus. Don't get me started on Harry/Voldemort. Dude's old enough to be his ****ing grandfather.
