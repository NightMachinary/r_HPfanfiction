Yeah. The only time I really find that remotely acceptable is if time-travel shenanigans are involved, and they're the same biological age, but even then I'm disinclined to consider it. And even then, there's still the fact that for the most part I generally don't like slash... Mostly due to a couple a of bad experiences reading slash fics that were just ****fests rather than actual plot.
