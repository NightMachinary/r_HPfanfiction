The trope you're talking about is called Peggy Sue, where a character time travels into their younger self with the knowledge to fix the plot.

My favourites of this trope:

Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by Viridian [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf]] was my favourite fic (before I read Meaning of One by Sovran). It's a Peggy Sue in which Harry won the war, but Britain and everyone in it died in the process. Essentially he cast the killing curse on himself in order to go back to 1991. It's an emotional story in which Harry questions his moral integrity for, in his eyes, manipulating the younger versions of his friends like Fanon!Dumbledore.

I love the concept of Forced Maturity by pseudonym. [[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127442]]] It's a post-Half-Blood Prince Harry Peggy Sue, but the twist is that Harry loses all his memories of the future. So he's got all of 16-year-old Harry's magical abilities, muscle memory, and emotional associations, with no explanation as to why he has any of them. There are a couple things I take issue with like the whole age line thing and the fact it's abandoned after the end of CoS. I mostly love it for the idea which has plenty more room for exploration, and the Hinny because I'm trash.
