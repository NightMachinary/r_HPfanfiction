I like these time travels that fit your requests:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): 20 years old Hermione returns to her 2 years old self. Hilarity ensues, but also heart breaking moments.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]], linkffn(4740107): 21 years old Ginny returns to her 12 years old self. She gets down to business right away.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059): 21+ years old Harry thrown back to his 11 years old self. He decides to take care of everything by himself, but the new Hermione is not pleased with the resulting carnage.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Badly traumatized and deranged Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan time travel to their 8 years old selves. They unleash hell upon their enemies immediately. Dark humors.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We are the Golden Trio!]], linkffn(7405516): The Trio and a 5 days old Rose are thrown back to 1991. They decide to defeat Voldemort in speed run fashion, and pick up a few more friends along the way.

--------------

And finally, my favorite "adult trapped in a child's body" fic is not a time travel, and is also the most popular fic on this sub by a wide margin:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), in which 'Harry' thinks he's Voldemort, acts like Voldemort, and has the power of Voldemort. But he only wants to teach DADA forever.
