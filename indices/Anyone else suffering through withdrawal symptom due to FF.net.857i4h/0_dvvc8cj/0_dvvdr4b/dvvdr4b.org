As much as I love AO3 when I'm on it I find myself longing for ff.net's organised crossover categories and inability to post multi-fandom drabble/ficlet collections.

Because it's /fucking annoying/ to be in a tiny fandom and have all the fics with the most hits/kudos/reviews being crossovers, fusions or drabble/ficlet collections.

Plus if a character is tagged in a ff.net story then I can be fairly certain they play a major role. On AO3 their being tagged can mean anything from primary love interest through major antagonist through 'this character shows up once and has no lines'.
