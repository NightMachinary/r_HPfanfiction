Yeah, anyone can create a tag, and there /are/ multiple tags for the same thing. But, two points. AO3 almost always recognizes different tags that mean the same thing as being the same. So for example if you looked for the Harry Potter tag, or the Harry James Potter tag, they'd both turn up the same stories because AO3 knows they're the same thing. Same with PersonA/PersonB vs PersonB/PersonA. But yeah, if someone creates their own tag for something that already has tags referring to it, AO3 won't know that the new tag should be synonymous with the other tags unless a lot of people start using the new tag. And the other point, those two tags you used as an example aren't the same thing anyways. One is a romantic pairing, the other is a tag for friendship/some other significant relationship.

But yeah, obviously the AO3 tagging system is YMMV. I've seen people love it because you can find literally anything incredibly easily, and I've seen people hate it because they don't want to see stories listed where the tags barely apply. Both perspectives are valid, I just wanted to make sure you weren't discounting the AO3 system because of a misconception!
