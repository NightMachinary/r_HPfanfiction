This is me too. I like the look of AO3 but all those tags and the inability to choose a central tag is just so annoying. In fact, that second part is what bothers me most. I don't think you need a ton of tag but it does, at least, warn you of ever trope you'll find in it. Every. Single. One. But no way to specify a main character or pairing? Yeesh.
