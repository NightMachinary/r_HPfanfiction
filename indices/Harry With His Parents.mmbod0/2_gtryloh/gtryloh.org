I'll recommend linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) once again, then :). Description copied from TVTropes:

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Tom Riddle launched a political party instead of a war, Harriett Potter grew up with both of her parents and all of the Marauders alive --- but as a half-blood, she isn't allowed to attend Hogwarts, and worse restrictions are coming. She isn't going to let that stop her from getting a world-class Potions education under Professor Snape, though, and so she plots with her pure-blooded cousin Arcturus Black to swap identities during the school year. Too bad that they didn't realise how outstanding she could really be, and how much attention "Rigel Black" would attract from those who would use or control "him" --- especially Thomas Riddle himself.
