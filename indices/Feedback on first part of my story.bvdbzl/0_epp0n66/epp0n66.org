Prose is rather simplistic. There's no description of where they are or the colour that context would offer.

Harry see's some 'random Slytherin girl' then later watches 'Daphne Greengrass' walk away. When did he recognise her?

Harry instantly admits that the DA exists, instead of blaming school gossip for what Daphne overheard. This lowers the tension. Daphne is a complete unknown to Harry and a Pureblood Slytherin who are statistically all enemies.

Harry immediately defends Daphne to Ron, when he should be freaking out and trying to figure out ways to stop them or mitigate them. The implication is that Harry already has some measure of trust in this random Slytherin girl. This limits the arch of the relationship, lowers the stakes and lowers the drama, because the journey to relationship is smaller.

You called Daphne Greengrass 'Ice-queen' in 2019 (I see it was published in 2017). This trope is dead and I believe a number of readers, here at least, will drop the fic immediately when hit with that cliche.

Hermione also has a good impression of Daphne? Where is the story supposed to go from there? They've already arrived. Shouldn't Daphne have to prove herself?

And that's just chapter one.

Honestly I feel like I've already read this story because it's setting up the same exact beats every Harry/Slytherin-girl 5th year fic does.
