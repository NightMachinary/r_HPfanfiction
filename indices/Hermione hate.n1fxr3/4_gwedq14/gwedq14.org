I'm pretty wary of Harry/Hermione stories too.

Mostly because so much of the fandom are ridiculously fanatical about her & they tend to make fanon Hermione obnoxious as hell. Because how dare anyone criticize or point out the flaws of their goddess!

Plus, honestly, it's been done so many damn times. I'd rather read a much less used leading lady.
