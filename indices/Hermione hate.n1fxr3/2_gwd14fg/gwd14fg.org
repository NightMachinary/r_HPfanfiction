Hermione is one of my favorite characters actually, personally I don't understand people who like Ron and dislike Hermione. I also am a big fan of harmony and think it should have been the canon pairing but I dislike most harmony fics, they're always so full of cringy tropes bad grammar and over excessive bashing. I actually really hate seeing Hermione paired with anyone other than Harry if she is in a main pairing especially characters like Draco, Snape, Bellatrix, etc my only exception is Ron when he's actually written well and when it's kept in the background.
