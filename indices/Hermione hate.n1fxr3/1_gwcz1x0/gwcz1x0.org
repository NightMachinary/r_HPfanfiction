The first point is, do you hate canon Hermione or fanon Hermione? Because there are a lot of difference between the 2 characters.

Now, concerning your question, "trigger" may be a strong word but I also don't read most Harmony fics. Not because I have a problem with "canon" Hermione but because a lot of Harry/ Hermione stories are full of tropes I dislike. After trying to read them for a time and always reading the 3 same plots with tropes such as "Perfect! Hermione" or "Death Eater! Ron", I just decided that I could not be bothered anymore and just ignore the ship.

But it's not like it's just a problem with Hermione. I dislike the tropes associated with her particular ship so I avoid them, but others ships (or AU) are also full of tropes. "Ice! Queen" is a trope extremely common in the Haphne ship (so much that I'm unable to distinguish some fics from each other), and Ron is also often bashed there. "Noble Harry" almost always end up as the Heir/ Lord of tens of House and basically own Magical Britain at 13. Almost all the Manipulative! Dumbledore seem the share the same obessession with Lemon drops . . .

90% of the time, the fics we read are quasi carbon copy of another, older fics. So the trick is to just find a trope you enjoy and just stick to it, no need to be "trigered" by anything.
