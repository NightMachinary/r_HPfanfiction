Personality Death via obliviation. Special obliviators who delve into the mind of the person and leave only classroom knowledge and practical skills in place. You would be left with a blank person who is essentially a baby in an adult body plus an infodump of impersonal knowledge. Then they would have to be "raised" so the new personality they develop is socially acceptable.

Therapy. Extract the memory for use in a pensive. Obliviate the person of the memory. Show them the memory in a pensive. You've obliviated the emotional impact and turned a traumatic memory into the equivalent of having watched something on a television. They retain impersonal knowledge of the event.

Relationships between men and women wouldn't change as much as you are thinking they would. The biggest part of why we act the way we do is mental. Men and women are different in our heads. However in a world with perfect birth control and without STDs there'd be a lot more sex happening.
