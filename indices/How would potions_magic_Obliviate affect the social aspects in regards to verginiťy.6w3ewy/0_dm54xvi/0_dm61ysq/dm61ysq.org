  Personality Death via obliviation. Special obliviators who delve into the mind of the person and leave only classroom knowledge and practical skills in place. You would be left with a blank person who is essentially a baby in an adult body plus an infodump of impersonal knowledge. Then they would have to be "raised" so the new personality they develop is socially acceptable.
