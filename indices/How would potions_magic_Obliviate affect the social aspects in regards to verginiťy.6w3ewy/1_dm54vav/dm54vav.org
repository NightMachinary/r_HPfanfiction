Is verginity a typo of virginity? I'm not an english speaker, so I'd appreciate this if you could clear this up to me.

First of all, if we assume it is a typo, why virginity is assumed as sacred? Among those in society who doesn't view virginity as something to be protected until given to your marriage partner, this is mostly non-factor. Assuming you are asking about whether this would lead to different start for active sex life, it would depend on the culture itself, the environment and how the peers in their age group do it.

Now, on whether it would affect the start of active sex life for students, we need to have data on when those spells/potions are taught to students, and see whether there are correlation between those and the start of active sex life. Since we are talking about a fictional world with its own fictional culture, any fictional data would give you justification. But the basis is whether there is a correlation between the time period when those spells are introduced and whether there is an increase of the amount of virginity lost among that age group, or older age group.
