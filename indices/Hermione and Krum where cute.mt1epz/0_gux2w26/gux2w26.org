Yes! They are my favorite ship in the books! I loved how Viktor got Hermione to just relax and be a teenager for once. His adoration of her is so freaking adorable, and I loved how beautiful and appreciated he made her feel. It was also a nice touch how he maturely handled his jealousy and how he is similarly fair-minded and justice-oriented like Hermione. It's just such a good wholesome ship overall.
