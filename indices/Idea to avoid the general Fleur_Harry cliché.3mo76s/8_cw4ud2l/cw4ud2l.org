Alternatively, you can bend the canon plot of 4th year to force them together. I've been toying with a fic where Barty Crouch Jr uses the Imperius curse to force Fleur to seduce Harry in order to further his plans. Harry must save himself and Fleur from her unwilling actions, which leads to her very high opinion of him when the Imperius is removed.
