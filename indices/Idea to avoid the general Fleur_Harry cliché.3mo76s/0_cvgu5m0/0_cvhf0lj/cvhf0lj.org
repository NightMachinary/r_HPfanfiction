Never liked Veela bonds much either, and any pairing between the two that I'd read probably won't have any. And unless someone does it really well, I dislike altering Harry's age, as its normally only done to have pairings make sense. This is another reason too have this pairing after 4th year. You see, there isn't too much of an age gap betweent Harry/Fleur, but more of a maturity gap, as 14 is a rather immature age, even if Harry is more mature then most, it just doesn't quite make sense. But if the pairing happens a year later, Harry is considerably more mature by this point, and it makes more sense.
