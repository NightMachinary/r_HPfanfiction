As long as you avoid common trope stuff like Veela bonds, making Harry 3 years older and randomly making the pairing into a three way with Hermione or Daphne Greengrass, you should be fine. I prefer to just stick with the basics, as jumping through too many hoops can make a story convoluted.

The summer after 4th year is an interesting spot since that's when Harry's name starts getting smeared by the Ministry. I think with how the end of year 4 played out, Fleur would easily believe in Harry over the English Ministry. A lot can be extrapolated from that.
