Not my ship, but I think the most plausible time for them to get together is as Fleur is getting close to the Weasleys but before she and Bill are married.

Once that happens, she and Harry start to have a life in common besides the TWT---they know the same people, have to deal with the same Wizarding Britain politicking, etc. And as she gets deeper into a world in which Harry is extremely important, she's less likely to see him as a child.
