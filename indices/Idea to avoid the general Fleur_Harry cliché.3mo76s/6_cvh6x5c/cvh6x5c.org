There is a story called "Letters" it starts before fourth year, over the summer the students of Hogwarts write to a foreign pen pal for a summer assignment. Guess who starts exchanging letters with the chosen one? They aren't supposed to sign the letters or something, so Fleur thinks he's way older then he actually is. It gives them a good starting point because they don't know they were exchanging letters at first. It also has a big focus on quidditch, and some inter-house friendships. Edit: Fixed story title.
