To tell you the truth, I don't her being extraordinarily beautiful or her initial opinion of Harry are that hard to get around. The first is only a problem because most fics seem to have this strange idea that characters x and y need to meet in chapter 1 and be planning their wedding by chapter 3. There's no reason her being way out of his league physically has to make it impossible for them to be friends and for that to develop into something further. The second is never any problem at all. Unless a story has exactly zero character development, there's no reason Fleur's opinions can't change with time and interaction with Harry.

Long story short, I don't actually think Harry/Fleur is an impossible, or even difficult in theory, but that most authors are far too lazy/short sighted to go through the necessary character development to bring them together in a realistic relationship.
