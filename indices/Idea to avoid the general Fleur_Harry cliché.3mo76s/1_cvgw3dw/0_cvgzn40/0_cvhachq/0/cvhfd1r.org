I also don't want a sudden, "Yo, I love you" "Oh, so do I, 'Arry" "Great, lets elope" type of relationship. However, the relationship beginning would be different than most Harry/Fleur, since unlike in 4th year, where they're rivals, here they're friends, due to the whole Gabrielle thing, and the tournament being over. I still want it to be slow though, a progression from friend to best friend to love interest that feels real and well done.
