Aye, I hear yah. Like said to someone else, there isn't as much of an age gap between 14-17, but more of a maturity gap. I'm usually not the biggest fan of fics where Fleur can throw Veela fireballs and shit, since she's only quarter Veela, though I might be able to tolerate it if the rest of the story is good. As for the allure, oh god no. My head canon is derived from a rather popular post on this subreddit saying that Fleurs "allure" is actually sound based, which is why people clog their own ears to avoid the effects of this ability. This, in combination with her beauty, is what actually effects people. As for Harry being "immune", no, not really. We know from the books that Harry isn't as affected as, say, Ron or Roger Davies, but I believe that if she sings in that way she does with the dragon, it should still effect Harry.
