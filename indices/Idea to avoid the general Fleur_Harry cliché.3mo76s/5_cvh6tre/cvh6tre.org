I just don't like fourth year fics at all, especially when there is a pairing. And unfortunately, as you mentioned, nearly all Harry/Fleur fics are set in fourth year. I understand why, of course. But I just feel like it'd be more interesting if they were to meet later in life since Harry at 14 still doesn't seem very mature to me.

Also, I hate everything and anything to do with Veela bonds/powers/allures. Especially when Harry is miraculously immune to any one of the above. It just completely kills the story, in my opinion.
