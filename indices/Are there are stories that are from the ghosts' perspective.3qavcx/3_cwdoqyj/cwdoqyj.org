Disclaimer: I'm not a fan of the story I'm about to link.

That said, I did like the author's other fics, and the fic being linked is not bad writing-wise, it's just I didn't personally enjoy the plot and couldn't keep reading.

Anyway, from what I recall (having read only a portion of it quite some time ago), Harry is a ghost for a good part of the story.
