As someone else says, this /mostly/ sounds like Arithmancer, but if you read that you'd probably remember it. I don't remember quite how Hermione gets back to studying at Hogwarts. While at Beauxbatons she is allowed to temporarily visit Hogwarts for the Triwizard tournament and iirc she stays around afterwards. She might not return "for real" until the 2nd volume, which I didn't read.
