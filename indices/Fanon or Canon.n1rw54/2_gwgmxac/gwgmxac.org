Literally 'being concieved when one of your parents had a lover potion in your system magically removes your ability to feel lover permentantly' is entirely fanon, if that. Given how avaliable love potions seem to be, if that was the case, even wizards must have noticed.

Metaphorically, the fact that Voldemort's father was magically raped by his mother, so that he abadoned his son in an orphanage and then Voldemort finding this out probably didn't do wonders for his empathy, but that is more of a generic 'nurture' effect than anything to do with magic I feel.
