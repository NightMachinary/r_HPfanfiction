The potion probably played some part, yes, but not to the extent of what we see in Voldemort. Surely he wasn't the only child conceived that way?

No, my view is that love-potion children might find it harder to love, but not impossible. What happened to Voldemort was probably a combination of:

- The love potion.

- Inbreeding Gaunt-madness.

- Haughty Riddle (and Gaunt) arrogance.

- A lack of family.

- The effects of World War II (Tom did sound hesitant to return, while talking to Dippet in the office).

- Living in an old-fashioned orphanage (they weren't exactly the best of places, though we don't know whether or not Wool's was all that bad).

- His own innate vision of being superior to others.

It's hard to say just where, exactly, Voldemort went wrong and how effective various treatments might've been on him specifically, but I highly doubt that the complete package stemmed from being conceived under the love potion itself.

That's more likely fanon.
