Just finished reading it.

It's just not credible that Harry could be that powerful after year 5. Other 'super Harry' stories at least have explanations, be it muggle weapons, intensive training, super wands, horcrux merging, or elemental transformation.

Your *Spygirl* story also had Grangers as super spies helping him out.
