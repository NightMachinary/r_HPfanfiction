Sirius keeps Harry instead of giving him up to Hagrid and raises him himself. Knowing the prophecy he trains Harry to be a soldier and completely forgets to let him be a child. 15 years later Harry doesn't understand basic emotions and speaks in a dull monotone. This is where our story begins, Sirius sends Harry to hogwarts to try to give him the childhood he missed.
