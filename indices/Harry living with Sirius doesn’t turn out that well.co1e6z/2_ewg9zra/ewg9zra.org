How screwed up do you want it?

Also the time period?

I'd argue in 1981, Sirius would be ideal. They'd have their problems, but he doesn't have azkaban to deal with. There's a couple of stories already listed here that deal with child soldier Harry because of the prophecy.

After Azkaban, it probably wouldn't be perfect, but as you see in OOTP, Sirius tries hard. He might not be all there, but he would be much better than the Dursley's. Some stories have shades of this, but either have Gary Stu Sirius, or a Harry that becomes a child.
