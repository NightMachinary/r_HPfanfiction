There was a story where Sirius is liberated for some reasons, and he then fights for getting his foster rights as a godfather of Harry, but he is still struggling with his own psychical instability after living with dementors for so many years. He has many creative wild ideas and in the end one gets Harry almost killed, and only then Sirius agrees to some psychotherapeutic treatment. Unfortunately, I have completely forgot the name of the story.
