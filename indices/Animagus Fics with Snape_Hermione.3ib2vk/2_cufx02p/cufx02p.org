Again I'm going to recommend my favorite fic, The Lioness Prophecies which has been removed from the net. But I have an epub, so PM me your email if you're interested. Since there is no link bot to help out, I'll provide a description for The Lioness Propechies. It's a Snape/Hermione story written pre-HBP so no horcruxes, Snape is a pureblood. The relationship takes place after Hermione is 18. Just a note: Hermione's animagus form is a key plot point, but we don't actually see her being in that form, nor is the animagus process developed. But it is a fantastic SS/HG story.
