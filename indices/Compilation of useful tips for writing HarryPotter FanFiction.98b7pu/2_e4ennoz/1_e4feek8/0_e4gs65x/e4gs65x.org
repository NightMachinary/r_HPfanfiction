Write short stories, "slice of life" type things. Focus on a particular character who interacts with a particular part of your world. Then after writing that you can expand it a bit, see if a short story can be interwoven with a few of the things you've invented. Shouldn't need to be more than 15,000 words so it can be written and edited in a couple weeks.
