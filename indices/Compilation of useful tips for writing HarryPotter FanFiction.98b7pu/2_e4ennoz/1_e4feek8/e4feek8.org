  Don't shoehorn them all into the same fic.

Aside from my tendency to get really into something for a short period of time and then drop it, this is what keeps me from being able to write actual stories. I like reading stories with good plotting and character development, but when it comes to creating something myself I'm way more interested in worldbuilding. The story would just be a vehicle for showing off the worldbuilding.
