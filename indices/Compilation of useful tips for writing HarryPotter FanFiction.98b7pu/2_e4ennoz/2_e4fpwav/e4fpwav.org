  Now I needed to look really deeply at dueling. My main characters will all, at some point, pull out the big guns. But they can't all fight the same. In my world, at the Ministry of Magic in year 5, Harry and co. should have got DESTROYED by the Death Eaters. In my world, you get what you earn, Harry and the others didn't earn their win. They didn't sacrifice to further their study. And when fighting at the high-end, I needed to make it more than flashes of light and elemental power. I needed to abstract away from casting. The methods of fighting must reflect the character.

Then make Dumbledore more useful. Stop following JKR's footsteps of writing children's story with the usual "useless adults" trope. Make everyone contribute, make every key player have their moments, and finally, tactical positioning is far more important than raw combat power anyway. Gallant duels will no longer be necessary if you can deliver your firepower against an unsuspecting and unprepared enemy. War is all about deception and fighting UNFAIRLY!

Make use of Tonks's metamorphus ability, make her the super infiltrator.

Make use of Dumbledore's alchemy power, and let him develop aerosolized basilisk venom.

Voldemort may have super destructive power, but he had to identify a target first! In fact, like in modern Muggle warfare, any Magical target that could be identified could also be destroyed. Voldemort may be super strong in offense, but a Killing Curse cast at his unsuspecting back would still destroy his body. And his Death Eaters would be of course far far more vulnerable.
