*THINGS I LEARNED THE HARD WAY*

Your fanfiction idea isn't the next Great American Novel. It's fanfiction, and you likely have a thousand ideas buzzing in your head. Interesting plot points, inspiring Original Characters, a new take on Diagon Alley, a resplendent description of the best magical trunk to hit the market.

Here's an idea. Don't shoehorn them all into the same fic. A good idea is a good idea whether it is written in one large story or broken off to accentuate another story. Some things just don't fit in a particular story. Maybe you /don't/ need that Original Character. Maybe the romance is just a bit much, and perhaps it could just be a love interest instead of a full blown relationship, that way you retain the entire point of the story without bogging it down with luvvy-duvvyness. I'm not a fan of romance stories, as you can tell already -- I'm very blunt.

Here's an example from my own (in-progress) stories. It sucks that I'm just going to fucking outright describe some of the plot, but you it's a good example:

  My problem is that Harry needs to be extremely powerful, and capable. He must be a skilled fighter, in his own right, able to fend off adult opponents by the age of 13/14 (to fit my timeline). He must /appear/ to be a strong candidate to defeat Voldemort (given sufficient time to train), but I've also increased how competent Voldemort is. He isn't mad, he's just very pissed off and has five decades of prodigious study and real-world experience to trounce Harry with.

  Now what to do? I must make Harry, power-wise, on equal-footing. I don't like to believe that witches and wizards have different "power levels", but it fits the story much better if they seem unusually capable from a young age. It adds to the sense of equality, inevitability . . . destiny.

  So with this basic premise, my problem is two-fold.

  1. Make Harry powerful, realistically

  2. Make Harry skilled, realistically

  If I just make shit happen, it becomes a power-wank crack-fic. If I build these traits sensibly, it becomes a neat little story with interesting character development, world-building, and should immerse the reader far better. The characters won't be Gods, they will earn whatever accolade's they need to win.

Now I needed to look really deeply at dueling. My main characters will all, at some point, pull out the big guns. But they /can't/ all fight the same. In my world, at the Ministry of Magic in year 5, Harry and co. should have got /DESTROYED/ by the Death Eaters. In my world, you get what you earn, Harry and the others didn't earn their win. They didn't sacrifice to further their study. And when fighting at the high-end, I needed to make it more than flashes of light and elemental power. I needed to abstract away from casting. The methods of fighting must reflect the character.

Voldemort : chaotic, uncontrolled, unbridled. /Likes to play with fire/, this gives you options as a writer. He can destroy the environment. What's the point in making them fight mano-a-mano if you can just make Voldemort /stomp/ and let loose a concussive wall of magic. He's a wizard. Let him wiz-out.

To go on a tangent -- it's very boring to read power-wank training montages. You know what is interesting? If that training comes at a price. Say . . . a relationship, or school grades (some people drop out of school and start successful business. It's all about how you set your priorities. If I took a kid out of school at age 11, taught him chess with Grandmasters, then brought him back into the population at age 17, he'd be a dumb fuck, but he'd also destroy them at Chess. It's all about prioritization.
