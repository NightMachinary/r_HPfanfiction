  My problem is that Harry needs to be extremely powerful, and capable. He must be a skilled fighter, in his own right, able to fend off adult opponents by the age of 13/14 (to fit my timeline)

Why do so many authors do this? I find it unbelievable and immersion breaking for Harry to have those power levels that early. If you want him effective in fights that early, use his almost perfect invisibility cloak or Lily's protection, but it's really unbelievable for Harry to just smack adults around in a fair fight.

Play to his strengths and have him win by being underestimated, creative and lucky, not through skills which would be practically unobtainable for him at that point.
