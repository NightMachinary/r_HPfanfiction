Stronger than most (untrained) adults? There are plenty.

Stronger than adults that train a lot, with better experience, better knowledge of their own body and with more time to dedicate to training than teenagers still in school? Pretty sure there's none.

The issue isn't fictions where Harry/a student is stronger than the average, it's fictions where one can keep up with the best of them all while being the same kind of wizard (excluding the The Gamer "crossover" trope where he's a video game character and thus not on the same scale than the others.)
