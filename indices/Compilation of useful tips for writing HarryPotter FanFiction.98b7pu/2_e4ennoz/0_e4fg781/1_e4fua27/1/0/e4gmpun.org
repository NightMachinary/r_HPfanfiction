Ok, a few things.

I was never talking about a senile senior, that would be disingenious of me(though I see you don't have that problem). I was talking about any kind of adult.

Good thing we're not writing canon then. Besides, I disagree with your interpretation of canon.

He was never meant to learn anything much in DA, but teach others. His DADA during the OWL year was taught by a purely theoretical, zero actual knowledge teacher. In fact, if you really think about it, the only good DADA teacher Harry ever actually had, that was both competent and well-intended was Remus Lupin, and that was during third year. Severus and Moody might have taught him well too, but they will have undoubtedly changed the curriculum to fit a year of students who went through Quirell, Lockhart and Umbridge. Besides, we don't know how effective the DADA course would have been /anyway/ since the wizarding world had fallen into complacence about the dark arts after such a long period of peace. We know for a fact that not everyone out of Hogwarts is automatically a master of defence, since Rowling makes it obvious most wizards and witches wouldn't be like that.
