A teenager beating up a senile senior is a different story than a fourteen year old trying to beat up a grown man. Harry has no way to get "combat training" at that time, especially since magic is difficult to learn in canon. It takes Harry days to learn the bloody summoning charm, which is just a spell with no tactical concept behind it. You saw how easily he was bested in every fight with an adult (Voldemort, Lestrange, Snape) until the plot armour kicked in. And that was after the DA and his OWL preparations.
