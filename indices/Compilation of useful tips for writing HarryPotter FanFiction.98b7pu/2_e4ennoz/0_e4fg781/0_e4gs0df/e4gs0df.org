To put it bluntly, authors do it because they're writing stories they would want to read. To me, the Invisibility Cloak is OP and is an "only works once" device in any given situation.

I understand your thinking behind using Harry's strengths, not making them up. But you're thinking too much into it. By "Fending off opponents" this doesn't mean wiping the floor with them, it means just about surviving.

This is all made up stuff, it doesn't matter if the character is OP for their age, you just need to make their journey there a bit more believable. It is not unbelievable that a talented student could reach adult-levels of spell-casting /in certain aspects of the discipline/. After all, a student doesn't have anywhere near the obligations of an adult, and if the kid focuses on a particular part of magic they could become very proficient indeed and outstrip adults within that slim scope they've focused on.

You see this all the time in the real world with students going to Math Olympiad's at age 13 and far outpacing talented students in the scope of the competition, a young student may focus completely on Discrete Mathematics, while a math graduate will become a specialist in something else in addition to a wide breadth of knowledge underneath that.

Simply put, if you had a talented kid at Hogwarts, give him the inclination to study hard (i.e. Voldemort wants to kill me), then have him ace his classes, focusing on the ones that matter in outright combat (Charms, DADA, Transfig), then in addition to that, have him trained in combat through, say, a dueling and drill himself with similar and more powerful foes, then have him get real-world experience against less powerful opponents . . . you see. There's a gradual acclimation of knowledge and subsequent application of the knowledge.

This way you can have your powerful character, but then he might come up against a barrier that requires Arithmancy knowledge, or Potions expertise, or requires an understanding of Ancient Runes. And he'll have no idea what to do.
