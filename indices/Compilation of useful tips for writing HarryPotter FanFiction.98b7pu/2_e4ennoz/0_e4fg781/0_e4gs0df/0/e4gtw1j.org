  My problem is that Harry needs to be extremely powerful, and capable. He must be a skilled fighter, in his own right, able to fend off adult opponents by the age of 13/14 (to fit my timeline). He must appear to be a strong candidate to defeat Voldemort

That is not the same as

  By "Fending off opponents" this doesn't mean wiping the floor with them, it means just about surviving

Dumbledore was seen as a strong candidate to defeat Voldemort because he could fight him to a standstill and force a retreat. If Harry barely escapes, no one would think that he had the potential to eventually defeat Voldemort. To be seen as someone with that potential, you would need to do a lot more than just escape.

  You see this all the time in the real world with students going to Math Olympiad's at age 13 and far outpacing talented students in the scope of the competition, a young student may focus completely on Discrete Mathematics, while a math graduate will become a specialist in something else in addition to a wide breadth of knowledge underneath that

Magical combat is a lot more complex than mathematics, even at that level. For example, during the duel in the Ministry Atrium, Dumbledore and Voldemort use magic which Harry can barely describe. To be successful in a fight at that level, he needs at the very least post-NEWT knowledge in Charms, Transfiguration and DADA. How is he supposed to have that at 13?

  then have him ace his classes, focusing on the ones that matter in outright combat (Charms, DADA, Transfig), then in addition to that, have him trained in combat through, say, a dueling and drill himself with similar and more powerful foes, then have him get real-world experience against less powerful opponents

That sounds like it would take at least a decade to get him to the point where he'd be able to challenge anyone noteworthy. Harry was struggling with silent casting at age sixteen and after a year of training with Snape, his teacher was able to mock Harry's incompetence at the end of HBP, and Snape is someone of high, but not outstanding combat ability.

Most of the feats Harry does to earn his reputation were luck and +plot armour+ Lily's protection, not something he did himself.
