*FINDING IDEAS*

I find ideas for fanfiction stories from literally anywhere. I'll sometimes lay awake at night jotting ideas down just because my mind won't shut up about it. I HAVE to write it down otherwise I'll forget it (I'll lost many /great/ ideas this way that I thought I was sure to remember in the morning).

Here's one such thought I had a few nights ago, scribbled awfully, I'll try to rewrite it nicely here.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort allows anti-Muggleborn practices and rhetoric to take hold not out of personal hate for Muggleborn (it's Muggle's that Tom hates). He uses anti-Muggleborn agenda as a /strategic attack vector/.

  Bigots in power = sensible Muggleborns stay away Bigots in power = qualified Muggleborns being rejected from roles, limiting their influence Voldemort can then use Muggleborn's abuse as a method to get skilled ones on /his/ side. He can use this as a method to /poach/ muggleborns. Muggleborns can be power-hungry too, and you can be damn sure Voldemort would take advantage of that to thin the herd of the opposition. Or maybe they don't work out and he just kills them after the fact.

But how would Voldemort handle all of this? I think it's simple really. To create a really /scary/ Voldemort, have him collect allies from all over the place. I hate the idea of Voldemort just controlling people through the Imperius Curse. It's a weak, unsustainable method. Following his rebirth surely Voldemort is disgusted that his hard work hoodwinking these people has come undone. There must be a more permanent way . . . perhaps by realising he can give a carrot . . . or the stick? Instead of just the stick. Perhaps this would be a better Voldemort . . . a more compelling character, with richer motivations, and problems of his own to deal with . . . perhaps he wouldn't install a puppet dictator, and would give the Minister leverage to keep the boat from rocking . . .
