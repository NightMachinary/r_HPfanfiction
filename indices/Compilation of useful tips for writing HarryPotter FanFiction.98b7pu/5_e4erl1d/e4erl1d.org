*MAKE IT PERSONAL*

But anyway, away from that /tangent/, making it personal means finding something valuable in your life, and introducing it to your writing.

For example. I've recently been getting into Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I've been reading up on training regimes, curriculum's, belt-hierarchies. Things like that.

I then thought of magical dueling, and how such structure might apply to that discipline. You see, I take a very hard line on spellcasting and spell-competency.

I'll lay it out real quick in regards to competency.

1. Dumbledore / Voldemort / Grindelwald. People at this level are so expert in their combat that the only thing that differentiates them are the mistakes they make. Can their opponent take advantage of their mistake before they make up for it?

2. = Aurors. Dark Wizard catchers. Super dangerous profession. Highly proficient mages only. More powerful than the average person (i.e. not going to back down when in a confrontation, just as a basis for their character, this then reflects in their spellcasting).

3. = Joint with the Aurors, are the powerful Dark Wizards and Witches. Lucius at the lead, then Bellatrix, then Snape, then I will say . . . Dolohov.

4. = Professors. Flitwick far in the lead, then Snape, then just behind him is McGonagall, then who cares. Massive skill in a specific domain, and significant skill in a separate range of domains. Why the professors (in general) are below the above? Well I figure the professors won't be putting their skills to the test under high-pressure situations where the stakes are life or death. This causes people to freeze. People who retain their skills under pressure are simply better than those who don't. Death Eaters and Aurors train under pressure, ergo...

5. DMLE personnel. Average mage. Capable of learning specialist Charms as needed for the job, but not the weird stuff like the Patronus Charm, that's just unnecessary punishment. Might not even be able to apparate at the lower rungs.

6. Average mage. Gets through Hogwarts or some other school. Does alright. Then works in magical architecture. apparition is a bit naff, bit dangerous, like. Best leave it to the pros.

7. Students. Defeat multiple Death Eaters? Fuck off with that bullshit. At this level, Death Eaters are practically God to you. Beg for forgiveness or play dead. You have no other options. You will be flattened by non-verbally cast Dark Magic and your last image will be of your decapitated body. If it was Voldemort, it only means you die quicker. You have no real defense aside from a Shield Charm untested in combat. Your offensive spells are inaccurate and ineffective, meanwhile your fitness is sub-par unless you're an athlete.

8. Idiots.

9. Ronald Wea-- just kidding. Pettigr-- just kidding, he's an animagus. But still Pettigrew.

--------------

But the above is just the "competency hierarchy" that I set up in me head. What about legitimate fighting skill. How is that developed? Does young Dumbledore have something the others don't? Could he beat anyone at any age?

No. He worked at it. Trained in combat for decades. Perhaps took dueling lessons under the greats of his Era. Perhaps he was a dueling champion once before he settled into Hogwarts. We know he fought Grindelwald after settling in at Hogwarts. I refuse to believe he was simply the destined defeater of Grindelwald. He trained, developed skill, refined that skill. This takes years of failure to perfect your combat to the level where you can defeat a Dark Lord with the Elder Wand. But then again, that was a very personal duel, so who knows what happened. Maybe Grindel didn't want Dumbledore to be upset after killing him, so let himself be taken prisoner. Who knows?

Back to dueling. How doth one learn?

Dueling competitions. Learn skills at Hogwarts, come home. "But I wanna use my wand papa." "Well sign up for dueling son, you'll be able to use your wand on the stage. If you make it pro, you could tour with a pro dueling squad and get famous and make a fair amount of money from sponsored cloaks and belts and shoes and beards.

But what if I'm Harry Potter and really powerful and need to get to Dumbledore level skill in a short time? "Well I suppose you better make it pro, young, or disguise yourself, go into amateur dueling tournaments with adults, get fucked up for a few months until you learn silent casting, solid shield, arrow-accuracy... get better, continue getting better . . . still need to get better. Perhaps an international tournament? New locations . . . potential for Original Characters . . . spells in other languages to defend against and learn to attack with . . .

You have so much room to explore this. Go nuts.
