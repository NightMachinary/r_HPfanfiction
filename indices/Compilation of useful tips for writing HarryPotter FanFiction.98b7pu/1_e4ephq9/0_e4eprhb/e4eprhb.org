Aye. If you've got a good story. Streamline it, make it the best it could be. You don't need to create sprawling epics, they'll give you headaches. You'll only find heartache. Start small. 20-50k words. Then rewrite that a bunch of times until it looks like something neat. Large stories with complex motivations on multiple sophisticated characters just sounds like a recipe for disaster.

In fact, I don't just think it will be a disaster, I know it will be a disaster. I've planned three such epics, and am in the middle of whittling one big story down into what should hopefully just be a two part series. I'm slicing away at the growth now until I can get the story arrow straight. No need to divert into meaningless worldbuilding. Everything should move forward the plot or build character, and nothing else until you know what you're doing.
