*THE MOST USEFUL TIPS I HAVE*

A silly quote, but it struck a chord with me. I realized after reading this that I was thinking about writing too much:

"I'm a legit human being, and this is a story that actually happened. Even though it's make-believe, believe it yourself, bring every detail to reality."

Basically, I wrote a story that started like:

"I'm a /bonafide/ classmate of Harry Potter, here's how it all /really/ went down."

--------------

To put it bluntly, /REALLY/ get into the heads of your characters. At the very least, spend some time envisioning who they are, and how /that person/ would be feeling in the scenario you've put them in.

To expand on the quote above (wrote this off my head just now):

  "It was insane being at Hogwarts with Potter. You've heard the stories but you can't /really/ imagine it. I did alright myself. I was a couple years older than him so missed the really crazy stuff, but while I was there I studied decently hard. With Hufflepuff you get a ton of help, and I breezed through my classes until OWL year. There was always something going on with him though -- every damn year.

  "He was the youngest seeker in a century, it goes without saying. Fucking ridiculous talent on a broom. But he trained hard at it, seemed to like it a lot. I think that made people get used to him a little when he would celebrate with the others like a normal kid. Made him a little less odd, with his scruffy shoes and messy hair, and that weird scar everyone tries to catch a look at.

  "I was in the hall when his broom arrived. Nimbus Two-Thousand. Bought by McGonagall, obviously. No one gave a shit though, catching the snitch with his mouth is still the best thing I've seen at the pitch, maybe a close second would be that Patronus Charm he did. What was he, twelve, thirteen? The kid's a beast. No idea where he pulled it from, I heard he was taught by our Defence Professor for most of the year, but still, a fucking Patronus Charm. That's Auror-level spellwork. And he was a teenager. No one knew what exactly he was capable of, after that. Well, I did get a bit worried when he turned out to be a Parselmouth, but that's a whole other story altogether.

  "What next . . . ah, Quirrell disappeared after he and Potter were involved in some fight deep under the castle. No idea what happened, there's dozens of different versions and takes on it. All we know is Quirrell died, no burial, no body. Just an announcement he'd died. And Potter in the Infirmary. We're looking at Sprout as she's telling us this like, we can add two and two, you know.

  "Twi-Wizard Champion. And the rebirth of Voldie. I feel I can say his name properly now that he's gone for real. Voldemort still makes my ma' squeak, so I've started referring to him as Voldie since Potter got him. Feels weird, like I know I should be happy, but it was appalling, the two years before Potter ended it. Appalling. Worst years of my life, easily. My final year in Hogwarts was, of course, Umbridge. Not sure what exactly happened to her, when Shacklebolt became Minister apparently Potter had a few things to say, last I heard she was in Azkaban in the cell next to Rita Skeeter.

I could go on and on and on with this sort of shit. To make a grounded Harry Potter story, sometimes you need to embrace the absurdity of it. Maybe have another character outright comment on crazy stuff.

/Believe in the legend of Harry Potter. As an author you have so much leverage in making him a believable, young Dumbledore-level warrior./ Look what happens above just by including an external perspective looking-in to the madness.
