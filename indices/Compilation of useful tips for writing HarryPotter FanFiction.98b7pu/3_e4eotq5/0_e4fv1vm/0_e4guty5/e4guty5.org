I hate responding to these comments, but hopefully you'll find some use of the below.

#+begin_quote
  a whole other story altogether
#+end_quote

You do realise I wrote those paragraphs off the top of my head, and didn't go back to edit them? That being said, it's dialogue, and people fuck up their words often enough. I think I'll leave it in, authors privilege.

This is amateur writing, we're not pros, and you shouldn't expect perfection. Should I stop writing altogether because you found fault with my work? If you have better advice, then share it with the community.

#+begin_quote
  But I don't think you're giving as much value as you could by simply describing what goes on in your mind during your own writing process.
#+end_quote

Okay, I'll try to give an example of what happens during story creation in the baby stages. Before I put anything to draft, I need to actually give a shit about the story. It needs to mean something to me personally, something I think I can do justice to by sharing to the community. It can't just be a rehash of another similar fan-fiction or a common trope. If someone else has already written it, I am wasting my time.

Therefore, my story might spawn out of an idle thought I have. "Hey, I wonder what Quirrell was thinking during first year?"

From there, I need to think, it'll be like a little conversation with myself that I'll put on paper.

#+begin_quote
  "OK, where is this story going?"

  "Quirrell's an unwilling host, he didn't want it, Voldemort tricked him."

  "An unwilling captor? But why would he even go looking for Voldemort in Albania?"

  "He wasn't, was he? He was researching vampires etc. in Europe. Maybe he just happened upon Voldemort, an unlucky encounter."

  "But Quirrell was smart, wasn't he? He'd avoid it."

  "Perhaps Voldemort incapacitated him, then while nearly unconscious, possessed him."

  "Wouldn't Quirrell fight that? Maybe he did fight it?"

  "And how would Voldemort react to that? Wouldn't Voldemort want a way to regain control, to shut the resentment?"

  "Quirrell was changed coming back from Albania, maybe it's Voldemort's doing. Caused by him fighting so much? That's why he stutters, jumps etc."

  "He'd be happy when Voldemort is defeated at the end, then, wouldn't he? Even though he himself dies?"
#+end_quote

... basically something like the above happens. It won't all be a single, linear conversation. I might have one question on paper, then think of something else while at work. Then coming home on public transport I'll think of another thing. And then I'll join it all together in a document and see what connects.

The end result is, "Quirrell is the unwilling victim of possession, he fights against his captor, pays the price, and we'll just retcon the ending so it's like Quirrell winning. Perhaps Quirrell acts without input, Voldemort takes control, which is why he deteriorates when he touches Harry, but doesn't when shaking his hand in the Leaky Cauldron.

  Do you even think about structure and such when writing a story
#+end_quote

Like three-act, five-act, seven-act etc. Inciting incidents, foreshadowing yada-yada? I know the theory and refer back to it as needed. Sometimes I'll peruse a writing book and have a technique spelled out for me, then I'll use my better understanding of the technique to enhance my work.

#+begin_quote
  Actually, never mind, your affected sneering attitude aside, I have spotted two more mistakes after that last one, and I'm suddenly not as impressed by your shtick. But by all means, everyone else can surely benefit from your wisdom.
#+end_quote

Your delusional sense of entitlement and superiority aside, I've literally no idea where you're going with that. And I'm not sure why grammatical mistakes negate literal years of experience writing fiction. I'm not a professor, just a 22 year old bloke offering a perspective and some advice. Do you think I get paid for this?

I upvoted, for what it's worth.
