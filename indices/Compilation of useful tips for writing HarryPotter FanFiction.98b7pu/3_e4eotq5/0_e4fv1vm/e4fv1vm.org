Whole and altogether mean the same thing here, so that's a stylistic error. A big and enormous one. A funny and hilarious one. I'm so sorry and I apologize. You know what I mean, you understand me.

You're smart, and I like your prose. I am reading Harry Crow of all things right now, so take that with a pinch of salt. But I don't think you're giving as much value as you could by simply describing what goes on in your mind during your own writing process. Do you even think about structure and such when writing a story, and if so, what are those thoughts? If not, why do you think you can teach anyone else to write, since you do it unconsciously? Get to the point, that's what one good quality I'd like to see fellow muggles learn from the goblins. But since I assume you're a muggle like that, this is the real world, so if there are no wizards either, there are no goblins as well, so I guess nothing supports my opinion, so feel free not to.

Do we get any links to your works?

EDIT: Actually, never mind, your affected sneering attitude aside, I have spotted two more mistakes after that last one, and I'm suddenly not as impressed by your shtick. But by all means, everyone else can surely benefit from your wisdom.
