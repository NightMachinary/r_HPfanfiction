Changing the name to a similar yet different name is what I would do. I would go for Alex. For readers who reread your fic it wouldn't throw them off entirely, and to new readers it isn't too weird a name and the name will probably flow with what is already written. And while yes Alex isn't too British a name, more of an american name, it isn't an impossibility.
