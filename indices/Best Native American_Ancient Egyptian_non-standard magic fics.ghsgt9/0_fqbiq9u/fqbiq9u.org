While the quality is certainly questionable, Harry learns Kryptonian Magic in the second story in the Last Mage of Krypton series. It comes in handy when he uses it to defeat Lockheart in a duel and later creates a no-magic zone just in time to stop Voldie hitting him with an AK.

It is noted that Kryptonian Magic is faster and more powerful than Wanded magic, but far less flexible and has a maximum number of spells available (a maximum of 11,133 potential combinations but 14 are highly disrecommended as being dangerous/lethal for the caster).
