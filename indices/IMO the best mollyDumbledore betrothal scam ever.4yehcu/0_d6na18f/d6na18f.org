The whole premise of this "book" made no sense to me. McGonagall is so disenchanted with Dumbledore's actions that she actually helps Harry start a new magical school, and then is like "Oh, Albus invited us back to Hogwarts where he has total control of the wards/paintings/elves/etc. I'm sure it'll be fine. Let's go!"
