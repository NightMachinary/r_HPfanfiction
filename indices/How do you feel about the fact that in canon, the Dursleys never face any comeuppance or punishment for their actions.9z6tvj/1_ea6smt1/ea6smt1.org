I wouldn't say that I "like" that the Dursleys never faced any consequences for how they treated Harry, but I can't think of way that would have fit in the story. You can't really punish them as long as Harry lives with them, and having Harry punish them once he's free just doesn't work. I mean, can you really imagine having the Dursleys reappear after the war? It would feel like moving backwards.
