Well, it was stashed in the Cupboard. And like I said elsewhere in this thread, the prison sentence is the same (14 years), so it's not like it would result in cruel or unjust punishment (like Azkaban).

And it was that, some form of mind magics to make them confess or risk going to court with little actual evidence (a lot would be circumstantial or word-vs-word) and possibly let them get away with a slap on the wrist. Or, you know, sic Bellatrix Lestrange on them. But that wouldn't exactly count as due process either.
