  and having Harry punish them once he's free just doesn't work. I mean, can you really imagine having the Dursleys reappear after the war? It would feel like moving backwards.

That's a good point. For Harry it certainly would feel like bad coping with his past if he keeps obsessing about the Dursleys after he's been 'freed'.

Though that shouldn't stop anyone from bringing down some vengeance in Harry's stead. Harry doesn't even have to know.
