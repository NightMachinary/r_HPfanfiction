I prefer that some comeuppance comes their way, though it's not super important to me.

Honestly I'm not sure if I've read a fic yet that stands out for having dealt with the Dursleys in a way that really prefer. There are a few things I would like to see in a story though.

One/some of Harry's more morally flexible friends get revenge for him. Harry would probably be completely unaware. I particularly like the idea of it being his girlfriend who does so... maybe Daphne.

Harry doesn't obsess, but gets comeback /casually/. Just a few minutes, a few waves of his wand, and voila. It could be something like a couple of curses that make their home and lawn perpetually untidy, that kind of thing. Nothing too crazy, but enough that they'll feel it.

The blood wards fail due to the poor relationship between Harry and Dursleys, leading to them getting Death Eater'd. Bonus points if the Dursleys are aware of why the defenses failed.
