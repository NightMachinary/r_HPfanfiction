What? The worst repercussion of all? Pfft, come on. Getting to continue to live your life as you wish to is a good thing. Spending what remains of your life getting familiar with the Dementors of Azkaban is a /little/ worse than that.

You think they /want/ access to the wizarding world? That really makes me question your memory of their characters. The Dursleys hate magic, they would celebrate never seeing or hearing from the magical world ever again. They don't see Harry as being part of greater things, they think of him as living in a society of abominations. Good riddance to bad rubbish.

*Edit:* This was snippier than it needed to be, sorry about that.
