I mean... they did suffer the worst repercussion of all. Irrelevance. Harry grew past them, and forgot about them. They just go back to their mundane lives, without any hope of calling upon Harry to access the benefits of wizarding society. They'll live out their lives knowing that Harry is a part of greater things now, which they will never be a part of. That's better than any punishment.

That being said, I'd be interested in a Post-HP sequel in which Dudley and Harry reconcile, perhaps after Dudley has his own kids and one turns out to be magical, or something along those lines. I'd actually be interested to see those two interacting as adults; Dudley seemed to have mellowed out, and actually gained the makings of a respectable person by the events of Deathly Hallows.
