Those are good points. I agree.

I think my real-life job as a social worker colors my preferences. I've read stories about appropriately-reactionary abused!harry, and it feels like the ugly parts of work invading my leisure time.

I was very uncomfortable with certain episodes of Breaking Bad (the ATM one specifically), and stopped watching Trailer Park Boys early on because it's too familiar.

Some authors do a very good job of picking up the pieces, but i don't like to see the process of going to pieces. And for every well-written, nuanced process of abuse and its ramifications, there's a story of torture porn that seems to revel in hurting the defenseless.
