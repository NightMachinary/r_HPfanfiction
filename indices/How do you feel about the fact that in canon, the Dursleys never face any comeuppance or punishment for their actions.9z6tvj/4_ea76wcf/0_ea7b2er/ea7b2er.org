  Cheapens the plot device

But what if you don't see them as just a plot device? In my opinion the overall lack of consequence Cheapens the abuse, not the other way around. It is a miracle that Harry didn't get some form of trauma from them, so at least adding some psychological damage (eg a desire for adult approval, being wary of people he does not know or no second chances) turns the Dursley abuse into something beyond a shitty trope.
