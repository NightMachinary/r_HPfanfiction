They are the evil relatives a la Cinderella and her wicked stepmother. Their actions and attitudes are part of the plot that establishes Harry doesn't have responsible grown ups to fight his battles. I feel it cheapens the plot devices to try and directly insert real world reactions, and hate the 'but muh cps' fixes.
