I for one prefer fanfictions where karma is a bitch and the Dursleys meet an unfortunate end - no matter who is the one doing the deed!

If Harry himself is going after them, then I love seeing them in Azkaban (with the seemingly low birthrate children seem a lot more precious to wizards, especially to people like the Malfoys which are like nobility, so I doubt they don't have some strict child protection laws!)...Harry reliving some stress (by pranking them or cursing them? Cool, but a littel out of character - then again: OC-Fanfictions are the best, canon Harry is such a bore! I frankly hate the character...then again: I really only like two characters in HP - Sirius Black and Regulus Black (both died while doing the right thing!))
