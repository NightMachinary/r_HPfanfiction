I read an interesting take on it recently, where the Dursleys weren't treated as a unit. The premise is that they got sick, Harry and Dudley spent two weeks with Aunt Marge, and after the first week she finally realised that Dudley was actually the one causing trouble while Harry kept quiet.

The thing is, once she's decided that things aren't right, she also decides that it must all be Petunia's fault, that Vernon wouldn't be that bad unless his wife was pushing things and lying to him. Cue conflict. There's also some Petunia POV, because you know, there's no pancake so thin it only has one side.

Can't recall the title right now, but I'll link it if I do.
