I think it's regrettably realistic, given the time and place where it happened. And, bluntly, from what we see in canon the Dursleys weren't actually breaking the law as it stood back in the 80s and 90s, although Dudley could readily have got a few cautions for common assault. Child neglect was prosecuted, on the rare occasions it was, under a law that had stood mostly unchanged since 1933, when it was still legal to pull a 14-year-old out of school and send him to work (which was only raised to 16 just in time to get my father two extra years of schooling.) It wasn't changed to include non-physical abuse until 2015.

Enforcement was doubtful at best: they weren't getting to all of the kids who were being beaten to death, never mind the ones who were over-disciplined and kept on short rations that were nevertheless enough to keep the child alive and not suffering from obvious diseases of malnutrition.
