If she'd connected and if it had been a cast iron frying pan and if she'd done damage more than mere bruising, yes, she'd have potentially been in trouble. You can hit someone quite hard with an aluminium non-stick frying pan and not hurt them badly enough to get beyond common assault. (English law doesn't categorise assaults by what's used, but by the harm done. Use of implements that aren't offensive weapons in themselves - frying pans aren't - comes in at the sentencing stage if you did enough damage that it doesn't count as 'reasonable discipline'. As I've said elsewhere in this thread, barbaric, but it was the law up until 2005.)
