Ah, you're posting from the US, yes? Limitation means something slightly different under English law. What you've quoted is the limitation period for issuing proceedings for a civil claim. If Harry in his own right wanted to sue, his 21st birthday would be the limit. For the criminal matters - Marge setting the dog on him, Dudley's assaults committed after he turned 8 - there is no limitation period if the matter is at all triable before a Crown Court. Magistrates Courts have a limitation period of 6 months for minor stuff like traffic offences and regulatory infractions, but historic child abuse can be and has been prosecuted decades later. Harry's problem with bringing the Dursleys to account before a criminal court would be that, unless there was something a lot worse happening 'off screen', what they did was either legal or only doubtfully illegal at the time they did it.
