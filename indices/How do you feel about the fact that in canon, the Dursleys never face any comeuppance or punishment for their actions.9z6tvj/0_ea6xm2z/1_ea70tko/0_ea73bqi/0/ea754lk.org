Thanks for the clarification!

What you've said made me curious about whether Harry could have pressed charges later in his life after the modern sentencing guidelines were published. Looks like the statute of limitations for child abuse is 3 years after the claimant turns 18, so Harry would have been out of luck by 2001.
