You're not reading it quite right. "Exposes" and "Causes or procures him to be assaulted" are two separate things - "exposure" in this context is in the old sense of leaving a child outside in the cold, and doing nothing about an assault you know is happening is not the same as causing or procuring it. There isn't any positive duty to report crime of any kind, even if you're legally responsible for the victim's care. "Neglect" under the act is failure to provide the basics of food, clothing and medical care, in which context short rations, hand-me-downs that don't fit and NHS glasses because the school said he couldn't read the blackboard will do.

Yes, it sucks, yes it's barbaric, and, until 2005 there was a defence of "reasonable punishment" that could be used to muddy the waters enough to make charging and prosecuting doubtful so long as they never broke the skin or left him more than a couple of days without adequate food, not least because the attitude was - and I'm quoting something said in reply to one of my comments earlier today, it hasn't gone away - "Coddling children is why we have adults that need safe spaces and comfort animals 24/7. Some people are just in need of toughening up."

tl, dr; Child protection laws are generally a /lot/ less stringent than you might think they are, they're dubiously enforced except in extreme cases, and forty years ago the Dursleys' canon behaviour wasn't, technically, illegal.
