Um... Dude, some of those are just unfortunate accidents, but stubbing out a cigarette on your arm isn't cool.

And as for it just being a product of the times, I've read stuff by E E Doc Smith - from the /first/ half of the twentieth century - where the cigarette thing was literally used as a form of torture to get a captive to talk.
