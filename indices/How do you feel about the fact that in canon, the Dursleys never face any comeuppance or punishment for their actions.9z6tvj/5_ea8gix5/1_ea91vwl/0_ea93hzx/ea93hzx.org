Those were the times in 80s Midwest farm country. For what it's worth, I could equally well make the story into a heroic tale of joy punctuated by crowning moments of awesome. (I did this exercise once for a NaNoWriMo, in fact.) It's all in the telling.

For this reason, I don't quite take Harry at face value with respect to his memories of his home life. Through the lens of a neglected child, it's easy to imagine embellishment of, say, the frying pan incident or the broken arm. This doesn't make him dishonest, necessarily, just human.

Memories, especially those formed early in life, have a tendency to drift and lose specificity, allowing our imaginations to fill in the gaps. It's always fascinating to get my middle-aged siblings around after we've polished off a few bottles of wine to see how disparate our stories are of events we lived through together.
