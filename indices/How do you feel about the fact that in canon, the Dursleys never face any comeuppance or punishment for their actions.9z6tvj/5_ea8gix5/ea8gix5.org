"The best revenge is living well." Harry outgrew them

I always read his early time at the Dursleys, when most of the alleged abuses happened, as apocryphal, with Harry being a somewhat unreliable narrator.

There are events of my own youth that could be framed as abusive or neglectful were I so inclined: having my father put out his cigarette on my arm; having a hot iron off the ironing board knocked onto my leg, burning and nearly breaking it; being driven to the doctor for stitches and shots after stepping on a pitchfork barefooted in late November (the temperatures were sub-freezing); being gored by a territorial bull; getting extreme frostbite to the point where skin grafts were discussed; yelling to stop my mother from running over my little sister with a tractor; having a neighbor friend who couldn't play with me anymore because (as I learned later), he was run over by farm equipment being operated by his father (who later killed himself); being inside the bowels of a grain combine when it was started up and wondering whether I could hold on long enough not to die; helping my father remove a neighbor from a piece of his farm equipment in which he unintentionally--or intentionally, this being the farm crisis when suicides were rampant--found himself trapped; climbing slippery rails on a thirty foot tall grain silo at age five without harness or safety cage to scare pigeons out so my father could shoot them; painting overhangs and cupolas in high winds; not always going to school having had enough to eat; multiple school friends missing digits or limbs from farm equipment; being instructed in how to tackle my father and administer CPR if he manages to electrocute himself working on high voltage electrical feeds without equipment or training; being made at age 11 to stay home alone and milk the cows while the family went on vacation; working until heat exhaustion; working 16 hour days doing hard labor; being pulled out of school during harvest season because the parents needed more hands and grain truck drivers; driving solo for the first time at age 6; being bitten by a wild animal and going through the rabies shots sequence (I still feel phantom pain); stepping on a rusty nail that went all the way through my boot; having to remove said nail with a claw hammer since nobody else was around; not bothering to mention it to anyone since it stopped bleeding by then and anyway, I was positive my tetanus vaccine was current; being snubbed socially at church because we were rather poor (we moonlighted as janitors for the church and adjoining parochial school); I could go on...

Framed the right way, this might sound slightly neglectful, possibly on par with Harry's life.
