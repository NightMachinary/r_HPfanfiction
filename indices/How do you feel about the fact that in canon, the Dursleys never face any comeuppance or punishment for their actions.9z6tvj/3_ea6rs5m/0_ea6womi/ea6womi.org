The issue is that a good lawyer would get them off most charges because there was not a lot of evidence documented and stuff like the Basilisk scar would void a lot of other evidence as well (he got that at his school, who says that everything else isn't from there as well).

That's why I went with a ton of planted cocaine (multiplied with magic) for the Dursleys. Same sentence, and spares Harry the long legal battle.
