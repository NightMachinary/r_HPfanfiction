Actually, according to modern sentencing guidelines in the UK, favoring one child over the other is treated as an agravating factor in cases of child abuse. Thus, if the Dursleys' abuse of Harry had happened after 2008 (when those guidelines were published) then the fact that they clearly coddled Dudley while providing the bare minimum for Harry would be relevant at trial and would be cause for a harsher sentence. This applies to how much food they gave Harry in comparison to Dudley, clothes that barely fit Harry in comparison to Dudley always getting new clothes, and Harry being used as a servant while Dudley never worked.

  Debatable, depending on how long after the review was done, and there's a good chance Vernon paid by cash, so there'd be no easy trail.

That's a good point. He probably did pay in cash if he was concerned about people finding out about Harry.

  Lastly, it's not even certain that any of their CANON actions were actually criminal in the time and place. You can't go judging things that happened in the past by today's laws.

Yeah, [[/u/ConsiderableHat]] covered that nicely. It's a legal concept called "/ex post facto/". Anecdotally, the UK does have a law that is retroactive (Criminal Justice Act 2003) and has caused cases of "double jeopardy" where someone is tried/sentenced twice for the same crime after the law changed.
