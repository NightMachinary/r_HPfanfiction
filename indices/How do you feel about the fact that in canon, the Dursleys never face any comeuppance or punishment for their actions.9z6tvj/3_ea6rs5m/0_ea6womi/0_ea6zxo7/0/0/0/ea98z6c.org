  favoring one child over the other is treated as an agravating factor in cases of child abuse.

But is not an offence in itself. It'll bump your sentence up if you're convicted of actually abusing the less-favoured child, and may get you childrens' services intervention short of prosecution if your conduct falls short of criminal abuse.

  It's a legal concept called "ex post facto". Anecdotally, the UK does have a law that is retroactive (Criminal Justice Act 2003) and has caused cases of "double jeopardy" where someone is tried/sentenced twice for the same crime after the law changed.

We don't have - have never had - any constitutional guarantee against that. Parliament can and does pass laws with retroactive effect, although we /would/ be in breach of treaty obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights if they passed a retrospective criminal law. (All of the retrospective laws I can think of have been about rules of procedure apart from two, claiming jurisdiction over WWII war crimes and re-granting the Falkland Islanders their UK citizenship with effect from the date they'd previously had it stripped. There may be others, of course.)

CJA2003 wasn't retroactive as to offences, but did relax the double jeopardy rule. It didn't make criminal /now/ anything done /then/, just made it possible to re-try offenders who'd got off if new and compelling evidence came to light, provided the Court of Appeal approved the new trial and the offence was on the short list of serious crimes it applied to. It is, of course, the thin end of a very dangerous wedge.
