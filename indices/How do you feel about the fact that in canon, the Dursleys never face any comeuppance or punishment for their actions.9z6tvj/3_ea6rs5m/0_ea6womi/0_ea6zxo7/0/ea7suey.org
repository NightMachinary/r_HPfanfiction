> testimony from Harry's old school teachers and neighbors would at least show that the Dursleys favored Duddley while neglecting Harry

Having a favorite child is not a crime, especially if the other child isn't your own. As long as the cloths are serviceable, I doubt it's a crime either.

> Neighbors could also attest to Harry being the only one seen to do chores.

Giving a child chores such as trimming garden/mowing lawn/etc is not a crime.

> A financial review would show the Dursleys purchasing locks and bars and paying for their installation in Harry's room.

Debatable, depending on how long after the review was done, and there's a good chance Vernon paid by cash, so there'd be no easy trail.

Lastly, it's not even certain that any of their CANON actions were actually criminal in the time and place. You can't go judging things that happened in the past by today's laws.
