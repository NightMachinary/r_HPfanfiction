  If Pomfrey did not fix that then she should lose her own qualification.

In the books Pomphrey never mentions fixing any preexisting conditions. Fanon could go that route though.

  That's definitely not enough for a prison conviction.

It's evidence piled on other evidence showing long standing neglect and conspiracy to prevent the victim from seeking help, which is taken as an aggravating factor in cases of child abuse.

  Statement vs statement is not enough for a conviction as well.

Not sure what you mean by that. Witness testimony is relevant in court cases, especially since Harry would have far more witnesses available on his side (teachers, neighbors, school nurses, the people who installed the bars on the windows, etc.) than the Dursleys' do. The medical assessment would count as expert testimony, which weighs even heavier.
