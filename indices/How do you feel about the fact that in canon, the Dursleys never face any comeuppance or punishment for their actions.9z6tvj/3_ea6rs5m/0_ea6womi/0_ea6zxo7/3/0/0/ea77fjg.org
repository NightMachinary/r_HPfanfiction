But witness testimony is/should not be enough to convict people on its own. And Pomfrey does not count as an expert witness since her inaction towards fixing the damage would render any medical license she owned void. She had Harry under her care more than once but did not even suspect abuse after a thorough examination (after Quirrell)?

I mean, the bars on their own were not a crime. Neither were the locks unless their usage can be proven in a harmful way (eg making Harry wet himself, keeping him confined for a longer time span).

The cupboard would count as torture, but it would be pretty easy to make the evidence there disappear. The starvation might be difficult to prove after a few years at Hogwarts as well.

Given how interested the Dursleys were with public opinion, the Neighbours would not see anything really incriminating.

It would probably be enough for a light prison time or maybe losing Dudley's custody, but certainly not the 14-year maximum.
