Speaking from my experience at court, that's not entirely true. Yes, you should get a medical report at once. No, having failed to do so doesn't mean you won't be believed. At least here in Switzerland. I've been involved personally in cases where all we had were a woman's word against a man, and we convicted him because her testimony was believable and his wasn't.

"It's my word against his, he can't prove it" is not true.
