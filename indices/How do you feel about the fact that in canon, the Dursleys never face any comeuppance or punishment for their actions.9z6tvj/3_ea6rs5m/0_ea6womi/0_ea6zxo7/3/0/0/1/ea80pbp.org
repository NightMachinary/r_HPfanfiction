Witness testimony is actually enough to convict people. "It's his word against hers" doesn't come into play. All that matters is whose testimony is believable and whether that's enough to remove all reasonable doubt of someone's guilt.

For example, I remember a case where a driver was sentenced purely based on the testimony of another driver who was cut off by them. And many sexual crimes are "four eyes" cases where it's the accused versus the witness/victim, with no other evidence.
