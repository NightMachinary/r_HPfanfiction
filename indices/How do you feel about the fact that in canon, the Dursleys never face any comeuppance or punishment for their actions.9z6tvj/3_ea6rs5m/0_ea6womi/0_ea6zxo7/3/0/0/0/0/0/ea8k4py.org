Literally any crime can be covered up by a sufficiently motivated and informed criminal, but I don't think the Dursley's even realize their treatment of Harry was criminal - and I certainly don't think they're criminal masterminds. They'd only care about the neighbors finding out, which wouldn't require erasing all the evidence. They'd leave traces, like which side the door locks from or signs of habitation in the cupboard, and then they'd be screwed.

Even the best lawyer wouldn't help them destroy evidence. They'd be on their own if they tried.
