That's assuming they get tried in muggle courts without wizarding influence/testimony. Veritaserum, a pensieve, or testimony from the Weasleys would provide plenty of damning evidence.

Even without that, testimony from Harry's old school teachers and neighbors would at least show that the Dursleys favored Duddley while neglecting Harry (clothing him in ratty castoffs rather than new clothes like Dudley) despite having the financial means to care for him. Neighbors could also attest to Harry being the only one seen to do chores. If Harry received any injuries from Dudley or Marge's dogs then a medical professional could attest to the age of those injuries, proving that they happened before Harry left for boarding school at age 11 and whether or not he was given proper medical treatment. A financial review would show the Dursleys purchasing locks and bars and paying for their installation in Harry's room.
