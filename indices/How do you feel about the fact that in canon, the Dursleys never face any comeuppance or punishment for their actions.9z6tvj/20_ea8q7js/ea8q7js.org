Personally speaking I found it to be an incredibly cheap escape for a series that gets as dark as Harry Potter does sometimes. School children get possessed by evil spirits, tortured by teachers, killed in open warfare against a tyrannical government; and you really expect me to believe in a no-harm-done, feel-good, happy-ending crock of shit for bonafide child abusers?! It's complete and utter bullshit.

I prefer stories where they are punished for their actions. Preferably as cruelly, inhumanely, and viciously as possible. I mean extremely slow, agonizing, torturous deaths that would give even Stephen King nightmarish ideas for his next horror movie.

Why? Because the Dursley's were child abusers. That's the only type of fate that child abusers deserve; both in fiction and in real life. They deserve to be put down with no mercy like the deranged animals they are.
