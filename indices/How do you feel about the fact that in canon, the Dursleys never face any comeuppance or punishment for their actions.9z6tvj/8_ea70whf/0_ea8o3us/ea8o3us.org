Harry was connected to The Dursleys by blood, so it's possible VD and his DE could've used them as a vector of attack by sympathetic magic or some dark ritual against Harry. So the order either had to kill them themselves, or just ensure they were safely relocated, similar to a witness protection program.

Not to mention that living people to die was against the Order's MO.

I'm more disappointed by the travesty that was /Battle of the Seven Potters/.
