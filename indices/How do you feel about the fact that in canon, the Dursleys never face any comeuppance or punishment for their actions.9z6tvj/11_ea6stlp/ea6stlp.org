I agree with [[/u/InquisitorCOC]] that they probably deserve some prison, but they are already quite miserable on their own, so usually I'd just pity them and let them live their sad little lives. As a wizard I may want to mess with Petunias head a bit, making her remember her sister and how awful it is to speak so poorly of her. I'd want her to feel some guilt, over the fact how devastated Lily would have been over Harry's fate and have her realize that Lily would never have treated Dudley in such a horrible way. Just to be clear: I'm not talking about torturing Petunia, just her having to face reality.

It's really important to remember that the Dursleys didn't want Harry in the first place, so usually I put the vast amount of blame on Dumbledore and his accomplices. It's so completely immoral to abandon a child like that, it really makes me angry just thinking about it.
