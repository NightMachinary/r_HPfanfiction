With regard to your second paragraph, yeah, I agree that Dumbledore's actions were reprehensible. One simply doesn't do abandon a kid on a doorstep with a letter and then never (it seems) check back, but blame isn't a zero-sum game where there's only so much to go around. Putting blame on Dumbledore in no way diminishes the blame that the Dursleys so rightly deserve. The Dursleys are unforgivable, regardless of whether or not they wanted Harry. Even if they had to accept him because of <insert magical reason>, they still accepted him. If one accepts a child into his or her house, that person has a moral obligation to be at least /decent/ to the child and treat them well. Harry was made to sleep in a closet for ten years. This is beyond immoral.
