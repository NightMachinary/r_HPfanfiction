  Putting blame on Dumbledore in no way diminishes the blame that the Dursleys so rightly deserve.

Yeah, but I don't think I'm doing that. I think you put it well by saying it isn't a zero-sum game.

Searching for the "ultimate cause" in regards to blame is certainly somewhat flawed, but in this scenario we can make a pretty clear delineation between "healthy normal world" and "something really fucked up is happening here" and that comes all down to Dumbledore. I think everyone can understand that it is bad to put a child in a closet and it rarely has to be said explicitly. On the other hand Dumbledore enabling this situation against his better judgement often gets a pass.

Lets create an analogy: Lets say you had a corrupt government that gave children into abusive households for bribes. Of course I'd want the abusive foster parents punished, but I wouldn't be as upset about them, because I can do very little about the existence of assholes and perverts. The big travesty is the abuse of power and the corruption.
