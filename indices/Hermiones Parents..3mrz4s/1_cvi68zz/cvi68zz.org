Fanon memes should not dictate writing. They are fun but Snape should not always be Draco's Godfather, as James Potter should not always be an Auror, the HeadBoy and Girl in the same dormitory, nor should the Purebloods all be Pagans (pantheon to your discretion) and The Golden Trio should only ever be a very bad Rita Skitter book.

Same opinion for the Grangers, either Dan/Robert, Emma/Jean/Jane/Mary, are they fun? yeah. Okay to use? sure. But don't let popular use of them close doors to your imagination.
