My aunt swears that this is a true story:

Drs. Florence and Winston Granger's first conversation did not take place in University halls - nor at an international dentistry conference - but in a chip shop around Farringdon in the early hours of a Saturday morning in 1973.

Florence was absolutely off her face at the time, while Winston, the product of a strict Bajan upbringing, generally shied away (and does to this day) from the indulgence of harder drugs. They were actually in close proximity for the whole night, but while Florence was embroiled in a particularly riotous session of Ring of Fire, Winston enjoyed an open forum of green philosophy among friends on the balcony of his friend's flat. A mass exodus from the house party in search of sustenance was suggested, and six years later, Hermione Jean Granger started talking as soon as she left the womb.

Aaaaanyways... though it started with H/Hr, is it not odd that one might find Dramione fics where they still go by Dan and Emma? Romione fics, even. It keeps throwing the actors into my imagination, and with Dan being eternally 13, it's just... yeah.
