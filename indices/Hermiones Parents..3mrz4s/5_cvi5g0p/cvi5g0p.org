Basically, because of the authors, and because some people have problems with checking their facts.

That being said, I do remember one fic where the author called them “Emma/nuel/” and “Dan/iela/”, pretty much for the amusement factor. I don't remember if the story was good or not or even what story it was, but I do remember the names because of how amusing a “take that” it was.
