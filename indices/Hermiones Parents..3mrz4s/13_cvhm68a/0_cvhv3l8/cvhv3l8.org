That is a bit of a weird statement. Ron's parents, Neville's grandmother and parents, Sirius' parents, Remus' parents, Harry's parents and caretakers (ugh, that feels wrong for describing those people) are all named in canon. Considering the amount of Hermione-centric fanfiction that exists, her parents being named is really not that weird.
