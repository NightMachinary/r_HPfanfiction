Honesty, any story that goes in depth enough to require naming Hermione's parents, probably isn't going to be all that great. And, using Dan and Emma.... I could see MAYBE using Jean, inferred from Hermione's middle name... but it's just another one of those annoying tropes that just won't die like Ice Queen Daphne.
