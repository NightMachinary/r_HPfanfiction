Yeah it's an H/Hr fandom easter-egg turned full-blown meme. I don't like it, but mostly because it makes it harder to talk specifically about good and bad fanfic representations of Hermione's parents. (It also comes off as a warning for some of the H/Hr tropes I really dislike, like manipulative characters and love potions and sudden shifts in character. Not all Dan/Emma fics are bad, but most bad H/Hr fics do the Dan/Emma thing.)

I was just rereading "Years of Rebellion," and I think FP's Tom and Cordelia Granger are great there---Cordelia, in particular, is an interesting representation of Hermione if she hadn't met Ron or Harry [or any "open"/"fun" friends] until somewhat later in life, and both of them behave in a realistically complex way toward all these people and relationships they're suddenly exposed to.

In general I think the Grangers are a great opportunity for fanfic writers who want to stay close to canon while still deepening existing characters and opening the world up to new ones, since we know so little about them and they're both full-on Muggles.
