I like the idea of the names being consistent too, but I absolutely hate "Dan and Emma" because the whole fic, I'm then picturing the actors- Harry being Hermione's dad, and Hermione being her... own... mother. It's horrible.

I just wish JKR would give us some names on Pottermore, then everyone could use those.
