Hmm, good question...would it be a cultural thing or a magical-power thing?

Their blood status, if it had to be codified...I'd probably determine it based on where they were raised. If they were born and raised in the muggle world, they'd probably be considered muggleborn-equivalent. If raised in the magical world...they probably wouldn't have a very 'pure' blood status anyway, considering how Filch is looked down upon. Although that might just be because the latter's cranky all the time.

...Speaking of Filch, however, I'd like to point out, the only two Squibs who get any real screentime in the books or movies are Argus Filch and Arabella Figg.

And, I don't care that their names alliterate with each other, nobody wants to see that pairing.^{^{+}}
