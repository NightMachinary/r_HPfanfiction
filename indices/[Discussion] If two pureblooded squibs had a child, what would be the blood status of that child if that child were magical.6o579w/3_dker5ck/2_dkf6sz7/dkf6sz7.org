It's not nearly that complicated.

- If a wizard has no muggles anywhere in their ancestry, the are pureblood

- If a wizard has no magic anywhere in their ancestry, they are mudblood

- If it's a mix, they're halfblood

- If they have non-human in their ancestry, they'd be halfbreed.

So it comes down to whether a squib is a type of muggle or not. I like the definition of a muggle being someone outside the wizarding world (that makes it cultural not biological). So I'd say yes, squibs can be pureblood, if both their parents are -- and the child of two pureblood squibs would technically be pureblood.
