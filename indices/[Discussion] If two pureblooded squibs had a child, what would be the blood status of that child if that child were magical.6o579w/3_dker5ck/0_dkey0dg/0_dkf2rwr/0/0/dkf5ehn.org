I think it's pretty clear that halfbreed is considered a slur. On the other hand I agree with you that "half-blood" doesn't quite cover it. I'd say that any half-something ought to be referred to as a "half-" or "part-" followed by the name of the species they're related to. I don't believe, say, half-hags, part-goblins and quarter-elves would want to be lumped together in the same category.
