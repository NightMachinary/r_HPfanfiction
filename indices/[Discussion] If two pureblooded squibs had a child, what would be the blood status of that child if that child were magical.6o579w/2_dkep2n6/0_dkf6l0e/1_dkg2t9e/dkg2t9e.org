This. When you get outside of muggleborns, blood purism becomes a primarily political distinction. You're a pureblood if the other purebloods want to call you one. Otherwise you're a half blood or a blood traitor or a jumped up muggle or whatever. The whole magical grandparent thing is people taking a Nazi comparison too literally or, at best, a in universe lie that is ignored were useful.

As Dumbledore writes in his annotations to the The Tales of Beedle the Bard

#+begin_quote
  So-called pure-blood families maintain their alleged purity by disowning, banishing or lying about Muggles or Muggle-borns on their family trees. They then attempt to foist their hypocrisy upon the rest of us by asking us to ban works dealing with the truths they deny. There is not a witch or wizard in existence whose blood has not mingled with that of Muggles, and I should therefore consider it both illogical and immoral to remove works dealing with the subject from our students' store of knowledge
