Oh, I understand your interpretation now. But I don't think that's what JKR meant, considering that the second part of the answer you quoted was

  Therefore Harry would be considered only 'half' wizard, because of his mother's grandparents. If you think this is far-fetched, look at some of the real charts the Nazis used to show what constituted 'Aryan' or 'Jewish' blood. I saw one in the Holocaust Museum in Washington when I had already devised the 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' definitions, and was chilled to see that the Nazis used precisely the same warped logic as the Death Eaters. A single Jewish grandparent 'polluted' the blood, according to their propaganda.

If it's the same, then 1 muggle grandparent = half-blood. Of course, that's all iffy and imprecise, and blood purists would alter the definition to suit their needs.
