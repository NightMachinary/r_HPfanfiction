My first fan fiction live was HPMOR, so not that one so much, but another author I read who focuses on the Harmony pairing has not stood the test of time so well. (I'm definitely not posting their username here, because I would never want to badmouth anyone who gave me hours upon hours of entertainment for free. I am still extremely grateful.)
