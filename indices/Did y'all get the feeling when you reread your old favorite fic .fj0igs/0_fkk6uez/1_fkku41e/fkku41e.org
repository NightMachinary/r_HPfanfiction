My bro, same with me but I'm 16.

Though at 12 I liked all the popular power-wank fics, now I mostly focus on lesser known fics, ones that dont appeal to everyone.

At 12, no offence bit I loved all of Starfox5's stories but now I cant revisit them becuase my taste has changed.

I'm into darker stories where the characters are pushed beyond their limits, Fate by TheTrueSpartan is brilliant imo but a lot of people will skip beciase of its zany premise, Ron MC and it's dark themes.
