I had this experience a few years when I rediscovered the very first Dramione/Harry Potter fanfic I ever read. I remember loving it and finding it really interesting but reading it again I got really disappointed because it was so cliche and hit almost every dramione trope I know dislike

So it kind ruined the story for me
