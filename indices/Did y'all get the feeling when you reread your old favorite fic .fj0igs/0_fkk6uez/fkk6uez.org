Oh yeah not so much now but when I started reading around 12 years old oh my gods so much I still read crappy fic occasionally but its usually cause I'm in that kind of mood a crappy fanfiction mood I am now 15 and my brain works far better than it used to when it comes to distinguishing good writing and bad writing

favourite fanfic to this day seriously everyone should read this it is a crime not to
