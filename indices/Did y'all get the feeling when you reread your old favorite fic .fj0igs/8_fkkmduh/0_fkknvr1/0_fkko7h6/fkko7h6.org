True, but beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, and I have been fortunate in that the story I love has remained perfect without blemish in my eyes for all these years. It is not really perfect, but in my eyes it is good enough that I can wholeheartedly forgive it of its faults one and all.

Yes... Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and this story is beautiful to Me.
