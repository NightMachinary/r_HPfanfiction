Yes that makes sense, I mean why not Achille? :) They used magic to get INTO the animagus form, and magic transforms a werewolf, so why couldn't they train wandless magic so well that they can use it in an animal form? They're still MAGIC, I mean that doesn't change right? I don't see why it would be IMPOSSIBLE, like they don't lose their magic just cause they change bodies. Like you can still do magic while polyjuiced for instance. :)

It might be like a one in a million, lifetime rare training thing though, but I think someone could.
