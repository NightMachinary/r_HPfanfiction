Since werewolves are pretty physically dominant and intimidating, it's hard to think there's much that could put them under the kind of pressure that tends to manifest accidental magic. Also about the wands, couldn't the werewolf jut set their paw on the wand and try it that way? Or if it needs intent, just have someone who took Wolfsbane test it out since they keep their mind then.
