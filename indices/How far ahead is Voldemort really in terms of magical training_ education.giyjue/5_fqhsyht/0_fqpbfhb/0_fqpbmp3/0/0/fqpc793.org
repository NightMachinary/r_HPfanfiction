I'd love to read a story that feels like canon (maybe a bit more mature) and has a Harry with a good mind and a desire to prove himself+ keeping his curiosity of the magical world.\\
There could be more exploring of magic/ world building and all sorts of cool stuff (exploring, adventures, new magic, magical professions etc.) But I haven't seen it done well often, if it is it's usually not completed. :(
