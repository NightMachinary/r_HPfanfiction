Harry would have to be in his upper 30s. 16 year old Tom Riddle would be handled by 70 yr Voldemort with ease, so even if Harry reads to know and understand everyday of his entire 7 years at Hogwarts he'd still be at a disadvantage in knowledge and practice.

And it's not that Harry /can't/ learn unless his life is on the line (this is even contradicted in GoF) he just doesn't do it until OotP when he's just sitting around reading Defense books.
