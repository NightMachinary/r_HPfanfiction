At least until Harry has finished school and is a few years into adulthood.

Sure, Dumbledore knows a lot, but I liken it to trying to teach an 11 year old advanced calculus. Harry doesn't have the knowledge base to understand whatever Dumbledore (or whomever else) could try to teach him.

From what we've seen of Harry, he's not especially great at learning things when his life is not on the line. If we take what canon says about Hogwarts at face value, he already has the best teachers available for him in the main subjects.

As the books drag on, even his curiosity seems to disappear, leaving his only outstanding aspect to be his willpower. While willpower is useful for remaining motivated through a long war, it doesn't translate to technical skills---think occlumency or nonverbal spells or anything really.

In conclusion, the only thing Harry can really train for is reaction speed, battle awareness, pain tolerance, etc. In other words, things that don't need magic.

At minimum, Voldemort worked through his entire school years, and most likely disappeared afterwards to learn more magic. He's also widely regarded as a genius by his teachers. Assuming he stopped learning as soon as he got his job at Borgin & Burke's, he's still knows a /tonne/ of stuff. The question is: how does it translates to combat ability?

If you've seen martial arts competitions, you'll know that skill is a big factor. If Harry dedicates his entire life to defeating Voldemort in a straight fight, he'll probably be able to in his twenties at the earliest.

But if you've seen a street fight, you'll know that sometimes skill doesn't matter. The key to winning a fight is to rig the fight to be advantageous to you. Set traps, take pot shots, be creative! A good hit and it's over. In that sense, Harry could beat Voldemort at any point. Think Harry vs Quirrelmort. If the horcruxes were gone, Voldemort would have been vanquished that night. Or, think Pettigrew vs Cedric in the graveyard. I think Cedric could take the rat in a straight fight, but when Peter won due to the element of surprise.
