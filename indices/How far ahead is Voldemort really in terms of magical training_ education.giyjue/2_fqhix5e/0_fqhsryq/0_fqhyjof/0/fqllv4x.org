There were real Martial artists (like Musashi Miyamoto) who were impressive on their teens but they trained since their Childhood, so a malnourished Harry starting on War Magic at eleven might still become a master but I believe it would take More than three years (even considering His illustrious heritage which adds up a Lot). Nevertheless while there's a big concern about creating a child soldier I agree, Harry should have trained (and nourished himself) far more.
