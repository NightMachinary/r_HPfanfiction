I was more thinking along the lines of Harry training for every conceivable subject since he could walk, such as physical training and magic theory. The only thing he wouldn't cover would be actually casting magic (which he would start at eleven). He'd have the best diet and best teachers. From eleven, he'd spend almost all his time practicing magic.
