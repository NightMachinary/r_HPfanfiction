How much will changing a person's childhood affect someone? It brings up the whole nature vs nurture thing. In any case, I think Harry will end up a bit OOC, but that's my favourite type of Harry so I don't particularly care.

From all accounts, James & co. were especially bright. From child-animagi to pranks to the marauder's map, they were extraordinary. Lily is awesome by her own right, as evidenced by her moving flowers and the professors' praise. Together, they managed to defy Voldemort thrice.

It's not a stretch to think that Harry could have inherited that talent. This can sort of be seen in canon, via his patronus at thirteen, and his teacher-position in the DA.

I'm going to assume that there's a good reason for starting magic at age eleven. Even with the limitation, there's no reason theory cannot be learnt earlier. With this in mind, we can imagine Harry speed-running his Hogwarts years with a highly specialized one on one curriculum for combat only. This means that he'll end up lacking in other areas, but that's not a concern. I do feel that this could be accomplished in a year or two with enough prior preparation.

Honestly, that will be enough to pot-shot Voldemort. Most of the Order of the Phoenix seems to have fought the DEs with just this. But this is Voldemort after all, someone who's very name is feared. He's probably much more powerful than depicted in the canon confrontations. Unless he's insane already, which is certainly a possibility.

Anyways, let's just give Harry some advanced training from Albus et al, because why not. In my opinion, he'll be ready to face Voldemort by year 4, assuming that there's some way to get him real battle experience. Maybe go join Dumbledore fighting some evil wizards on mainland Europe?

I prefer to think of channelling magic like flexing a muscle. You can't run out of magic just like you can't run out of muscle. I think 14 seems like a reasonable age for a prodigy-child to be able to channel more magic than the average adult. This age is sort of backed by canon through everyone's reactions to Harry being entered into the Triwizard tournament and Harry's patronus.

So assuming his education is entirely focused on combat, I think 14 seems to be a reasonable age. But he'll be horrible at everything other than straight up fighting due to his lack of people-skills.
