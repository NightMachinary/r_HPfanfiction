True so maybe a better question would be at which point Harry would be powerful enough to spring a trap and have a decent chance of fighting his way out of it fails.

But yea by preparing him I also means raising him to fulfil his potential, I'm not a child psychologist but the whole Dursley thing and growing up with the number one rule being "don't ask questions" probably didn't do him any favours.

Also he might have had expert teachers but individual tutoring is definitely more effective, especially for people with learning styles that don't fit with the normal class style way of teaching.

But yea I was imagining it based on him being raised properly and then increasing the pressure whenever he's ready..
