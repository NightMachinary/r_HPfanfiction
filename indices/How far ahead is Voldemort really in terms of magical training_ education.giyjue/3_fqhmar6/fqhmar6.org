You're forgetting that Voldemort has done rituals and the like to boost his strength. McGonagall's conversation with Dumbledore heavily implies this in the first chapter of PS.

The result of these boosts mean that Voldemort is able to match Dumbledore when they duel in OotP. And Dumbledore has been around about 50 years more than Voldemort - that's 50 years more experience. Dumbledore also is possessing the unbeatable Elder Wand - which for the sake of story, let's assume just increases the power of his spells - and is still not able to outduel Voldemort. Dumbledore also has access to way more information since people are more open to share their knowledge with the person who is widely regarded as the saviour of Europe, unlike Voldemort.

So in essence, unless Harry is a prodigy of the same class as Voldemort or Dumbledore and willing to go through those same rituals, he doesn't stand a chance against Voldemort.
