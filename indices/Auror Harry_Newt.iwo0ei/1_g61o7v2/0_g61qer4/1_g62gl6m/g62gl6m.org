She got a bunch of death threats, stalkers, abuse from readers, etc. so she deleted everything from ffn. She's still on ao3 and she also posts updates on [her facebook page]([[https://www.facebook.com/pg/Araceilfanfiction/notes/]]) although she doesn't post the actual chapters there anymore, just links to ao3. As far as I know, Against My Nature has been discontinued, but she has up to chapter 32 on her facebook (you just gotta scroll a bit) and I think many of her old fics can be found there, too.

Ultimately, an unfortunate reminder to all of us to be kind to writers!
