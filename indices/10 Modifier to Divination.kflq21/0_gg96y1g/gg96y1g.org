As Hermione stepped into the boys' dorm room, she was met with a cloud of sickly sweet smoke and and a low, thumping beat coming from the Wizarding Wireless.

"What in Merlin's name is going on here?" She asked between coughs.

Harry barely glanced up from the multiple crystal balls he was arranging on the bedspread as he replied. "Divination. We're trying to figure out what Voldemort is up to. Neville, anything in the smoke yet? And where the hell is Ron?"

"Yes, my Lord?"

Lord Voldemort stood amongst the remains of his latest attempt, clearly unbothered by the blood and guts staining his clothing and hands. "Get me another peacock, I need fresh entrails to read. Potter is *up to something!*
