I did read one (‘The many deaths of Harry Potter', every time he dies he resets to a past point) where he tried pretending he was a Seer for a while but can't pull it off lol. The actions he takes due to the foreknowledge he has changes the future so what he ‘foresees' doesn't actually happen and no-one believes him.

I think I've seen it done in one other fic too, a Tom/Harry time travel one.
