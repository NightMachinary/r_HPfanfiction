I have always wondered why there don't seem to be any redo/timetravel fics where the characters have the usual "can't tell anybody otherwise will be studied by the ministry/executed/whatever" and pretend to be a seer instead. "I had a vision of Scabbers turning into a man."

On another note, I always preferred the idea that being the subject of a prophecy would make you worse at divination. If you see the future, then that fixes what you see as inevitable, so the more you use seer powers, the less able you are to actually affect the future. The flip side of this would be those who do change the future, e.g. those involved in prophecies, cannot look forward as that would fix the result, if that makes any sense.
