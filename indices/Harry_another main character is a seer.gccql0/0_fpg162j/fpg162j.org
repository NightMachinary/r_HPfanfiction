I haven't been keeping up with it lately, but I've read most of it. Main character is the second Weasley daughter (i.e. an OC) who is a seer and ends up sorted into Slytherin. I enjoyed it quite a bit, and I remember quite a few of the plot beats being very interesting. It uses the concept of a 'magical core' quite extensively - which I've heard is a big deal breaker for some people - but it really didn't bother me at all.
