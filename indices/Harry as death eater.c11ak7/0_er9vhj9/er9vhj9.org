I just want to read a fic that portrays Harry as Death Eater (with no "Harry is Voldemort's second in command" bullshit, just a common DE), and treats the subject as the tragedy it would be, with no Voldemort/DE apologism. A story where perhaps, at the beginning, Harry is manipulated, but later on makes his own choices and stand by them (again, no apologism for joining the terrorist group that killed his parents).

I don't think I've ever seen one of those.
