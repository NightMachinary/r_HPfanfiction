In any story like this, Harry couldn't be just some "common DE". The prophecy says he'll have the power to defeat Voldemort, so if Voldemort didn't just straight up kill him, he'd have to be a very high up and influential member. So unless the story gives the prophecy to someone else, it would make no sense. And then if that happened, there would be no point to follow Harry, because he'd just be some random thug.
