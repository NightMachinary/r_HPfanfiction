That's assuming that Harry himself knows about the prophecy. In other scenarios, it's reasonable to think that Voldemort wouldn't want one of his followers aware that they have the power to bring him down. And besides Voldemort, Dumbledore and Snape, there would be no one to tell Harry about it - and writing about how internal and external circumstances led these characters to keep the secret would be part of the fun. Harry ending up a lowly DE despite the prophecy is even more tragic (and, as I said, I'd want to read this written as a tragedy).

And I am very partial to AUs that go beyond canon divergence, so I am fine with a setting that, for example, has Harry being a common war orphan that ends up as DE, without the prophecy being involved, as long as a few character traits and personality remain similar, and the differences are explained through character development. But I am understand that some people do not like very different AUs. My complaint is more on the lines that no matter how wildly different the setting is from canon, a Harry joins Voldemort fic always portraits him as a important/influential member, when it doesn't need to be that way.
