That's...hardly a theory. That seems like a fanfiction only loosely connected to the canon plot of Harry Potter.

Still, I did see a one-shot where everything was portrayed as a fantasy, and Harry's killing Voldemort at the very end was revealed to his actually having stabbed Dudley in front of everyone in school. That fic was solely twist-without-plot, though.

--------------

Still, a fanfiction can be made out of this; a less depressing one, too.

Like, let's say, what if the author of the Harry Potter books...is Harry Potter? After being rescued from the Dursleys, he struggles with basic life skills and living normally, so the psychiatrist he regularly works with encourages him to practice writing stories (something he is good at), to look at his problems from an outside perspective.

Thus, the events of the books are a combination of his desires and what he wants to be (confront and destroy his parents killer, become good at sports, make proper friends), and also express stuff he struggles to face directly as fictional things (the Dursleys neglect, unfair punishments, being singled out, et-cetera).

The house-elves are an anthropomorphisation of the 'safety net' that Harry feels, grown adults who do all the little things and housekeeping responsibilities that he's not up to yet; dementors are similarly an anthropomorphisation of Harry's worst bouts of depression and how they threaten to turn him into a vegetable. Et-cetera et-cetera, all of the more fantastical elements are metaphors for various ideas that Harry is exploring as a writer.
