Well, I read a huge part of the french fanfiction worth reading (according to my criteria) in the 10+ years I've been reading fanfiction. Then began reading english fanfiction 2 years ago. So i guess I've seen a LOT of fanfiction types/trends. But this is a "theory"/idea I haven't had the chance to read, so I'm a bit curious about how it would work out.
