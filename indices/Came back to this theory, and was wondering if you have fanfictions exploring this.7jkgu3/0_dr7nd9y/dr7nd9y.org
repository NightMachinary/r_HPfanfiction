Eh. I'm so sick of "theories" like that. I think this is like the third or fourth "Harry is insane and Hogwarts is his delusional fantasy" theory I've come across on the net.

Every time a work of fiction is the least bit supernatural, magical or fantastic, then come the "clever" theories that it's a sign that the main character has gone insane and all of canon is just delusional fantasies.

Or alternately, that the main character is in a coma and everything that happens is just a dream, and when the story ends it means the main character finally died.

I'm not against stories where fantastical dreams are metaphors for a grim reality, but not every single fantasy story has to "really" be a horror story about how the main character is dying or being abused or stuck in a mental ward or whatever.
