Problem with the twins in fanfics is that they're usually used mainly for comedy reliefe... and stories acrtually starring them tend to be one of two:

1: A female OC (probably a self-insert) befriends the twins and gets together with one or both of them.\\
2: Fred is dead, and George angsts about it.

Gets kind of old after a while. Oh, and there are a handful of "Weasley twins meet the Marauders" stories, but none of them seem to be any good....

There are a couple more interesting ones though.

I liked Why Can't It Be A Joke? where Fred and George accidentally travel back in time and alter the timeline so that the wizarding world becomes a total dystopia, and they have to find out how to fix it.... unfortunately the fic seems to be good and dead, but I liked the build-up of what it did have. linkffn(6957439)
