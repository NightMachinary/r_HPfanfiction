I like the idea that Hogwarts is supposedly the safest magical school in the world due to a concept like this. Inflict as much of the misfortune as magically possible on a single child, and as long as that child survives, the rest of the school does very well. That child either dies very quickly, or becomes very good at surviving the random dangerous bullshit.

What else could explain why so much bad crap happens to Harry, while the rest of the school seems to have a fairly normal existence? (Other than being a protagonist!)
