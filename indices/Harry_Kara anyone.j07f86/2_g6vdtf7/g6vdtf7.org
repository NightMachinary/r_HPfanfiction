I've been looking for a good Harry and Supergirl(CW) fic . There are not a lot there. I think this pairing should really pic up some steam. This a a pretty good power couple. There is some story .....search “silver speedster” on ffnet. I think that is the only decent story I know. It's kinda over the top. But you take what you get.
