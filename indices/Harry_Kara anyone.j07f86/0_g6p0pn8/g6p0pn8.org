There's Terminal Justice, half-way through the story, but at this point it's more an OC with Harry's name/face than actually Harry being Harry.

The quality also degrades as the story goes on, since it looks like the author was running out of ideas/a plot-direction.

There are also a few 'lost' chapters that were never uploaded to the FFn fork, but they were lost once Yahoo Groups were closed (they were on CA).

But, yeah, definitely agree with you on Megamatt09's stuff. /Jesus Christ./
