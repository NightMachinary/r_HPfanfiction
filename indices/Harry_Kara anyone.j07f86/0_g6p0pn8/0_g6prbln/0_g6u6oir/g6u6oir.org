Terminal Justice is the follow-up to the Mr Black stories [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make A Wish]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3032621/1/The-Hunt-For-Harry-Potter][The Hunt For Harry Potter]], in which Harry is "just a man on vacation".

The collected Mr Black stories (by various authors) can be found at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Black-INK/71873/99/4/1/0/0/0/0/][Black Ink]].
