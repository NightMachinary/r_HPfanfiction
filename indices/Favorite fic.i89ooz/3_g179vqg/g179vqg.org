Harry/Hermione. They find Avalon and Excalibur while on the Horcrux Hunt, Harry dies killing Voldemort, leaving behind a pregnant Hermione. Years later, Avalon shenanigans bring him back, but Voldemort isn't completely dead either.

Significant smut, violence, fluff involving cute kid. If any of those are turnoffs you should probably skip it.
