linkffn(Harry McGonagall) and linkffn(Harry Potter McGonagall) where Harry is raised by Minerva's nephew and his family. They're really sweet but don't have much conflict.

linkffn(Harry Crow) has a Harry raised by the goblins of Gringotts. Haven't read it, but most everyone on this sub seems to hate it. Robst commonly employs Mary-Sues and Gary-Stus, so if you don't like those tropes then don't bother.
