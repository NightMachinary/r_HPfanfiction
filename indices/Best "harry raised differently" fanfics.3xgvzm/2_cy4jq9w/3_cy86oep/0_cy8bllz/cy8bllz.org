I was disappointed with it because he was constantly whining through half the books about how hard it's gonna be for him to free all these creatures when so many powerful people want to preserve the status quo, and then he basically consumes all of Voldemort's power and throws it all away. With some bullshit handwave like sharing it with sea water and whatnot.

The other disappointing one was Mastermind hunting. Here too Harry grew OPed and then smacked his head on an idiot ball. Only here he screwed up not only himself, but also almost triggered an end-of-the-world scenario to happen.
