I'm surprised you didn't like the ending to the sacrifices fic; I was pretty happy with it. You've mentioned a few others have disappointing endings - would the endings compare? Do you rate them on a scale? For example, would you consider the ending of sacrifices better or wiser than your other picks. Am curious to know before i start. Thanks!
