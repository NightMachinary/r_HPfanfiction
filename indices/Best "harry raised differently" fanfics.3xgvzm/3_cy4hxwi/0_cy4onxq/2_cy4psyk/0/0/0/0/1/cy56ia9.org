Please take this link down. Neither Santi nor DLP has given any permission for his property to be taken outside of the forums. It is incredibly disrespectful to the author that someone would do this. Taking it for personal use it one thing, taking it to share with other people is another. Santi made a conscious decision not to post the extra chapters on ffnet or elsewhere and keep them on DLP. He's not dead, he visited the forums a couple months ago.

If Santi ever wants to post this somewhere else, he will. Until then, you guys can grow up, take a few minutes out of your day and post a small amount of posts in the forums to gain access, and be done with it. It's childish to assume everything on the internet is for your viewing pleasure, and if it isn't, you have the right to take it without the author's permission.

We tried to reason with the creator of this google doc, PmMeFanFic, I assume, but he didn't care. All he did was write a disclaimer at the top and then ignored everything we said afterwards.
