Moral high ground fallacy, really? No, man, no. Get the hell off your high horse. I've tried being nice in this sub, I really have. All I've gotten are downvotes and people who refuse to adhere to basic social niceties.

We're on the same side. Neither one of us want authors to feel as if their work is being stolen, plagiarized, or removed from their control. It is THEIR property, not yours to do as you see fit. This isn't a fallacy. If you want to call it a fallacy, then so be it. I *do* see myself as better than you if you can't understand the simple fact that authors own whatever piece of writing they're working on. There *is* a problem with taking something free and redistributing it for the benefit of everyone if the /author doesn't want you to/. These aren't fucking hoops to jump through. It's making a motherfucking account on a motherfucking site and making a few motherfucking posts to access the motherfucking story.

Our WbA isn't for your pleasure or amusement. Everything is not about you and your ability to get things that you want. Our WbA is for authors first and foremost, and people who want to help authors be better second. People like you, who just want to read the fic without giving feedback aren't even on our radar. We don't care if you do it, but we aren't going to fucking *help* you do it. That's why these aren't hoops for you to jump through to get access, we don't fucking CARE if you have access. The first two groups, the people that actually matter, do have access.

If you want to join our site and participate, we welcome you with open arms. If you want to join our site just to read fanfics, that's fine too. But don't fucking complain about having to spend a few minutes to make a few posts in a forum that encompasses everything from politics to My Little Pony to satiate yourself on fics that authors don't want released to the public yet.

But no, go stick your fucking fingers in your ear like a goddamn 10 year old and cry fallacy, because my fucking 2 year old nephew understands why taking stuff without permission of the owner is morally wrong. I'm sorry that I assume would as well. Where the fuck do you get off by saying you have the authority to take someone's work and release it to the public against their wishes?
