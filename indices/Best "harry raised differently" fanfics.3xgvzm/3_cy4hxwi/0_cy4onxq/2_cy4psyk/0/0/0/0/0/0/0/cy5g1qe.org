Yes - the purpose of WbA is for a writer to receive critical feedback on first drafts of work. It's a great way to get helpful feedback that varies anywhere from helping rephrase bad sentences structures and correct spelling mistakes, to discovering that you've made significant mistakes like getting canon details wrong or needing to change entire plot points.

It's not uncommon for a second draft of a story to look completely different. That's why it's important to a lot of authors that the only people who read their first drafts are the people providing that critical feedback - you don't want people to read what might change significantly when you're finished with it, particularly since most people aren't going to read a chapter twice.
