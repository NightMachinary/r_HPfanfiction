Legality has no place in this discussion. The author writes fanfiction for zero monetary gain, so it is entirely up to them to continue. If the author does not wish it to be made public yet, then it should not be made public. Period. If the author feels that only certain individuals should be able to read it, then we must oblige their wishes. It's not a matter of legality, it's matter of decency. Thank you for taking the link down, it means a lot. But fanfiction is entirely based upon a good-natured relationship between the author and his/her readers. We should not, and can not, break that relationship.
