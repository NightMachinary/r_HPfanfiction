Please consider looking up the meaning of the fallacy. In this case the moral high ground fallacy refers to calling people childish for disagreeing with you. I would argue that the author of original literature has the right to decide what can and cannot be done with his work. Fanfiction of copyrighted material does not fall in that catergory. It is a grey zone that can not be legally enforced, therefore any adherance to the authors wishes are strictly on a voluntary basis. If I wish to consume content provided in the WbA forum with the intent of deriving pleasure or amusement from it, that is entierely up to me. The rest of the third paragraph is just boasted with unfounded assumptions and will therefore be skipped. I will and have joined the DLP community in all its glory and I'm not complaining about putting in the posts. I am merely stating that some people do not want to be bothered with joining a community that is basically the Fanfic equivalent of /v/ when it comes to arogancy. While this is exacly the type of cynical enviroment I prefer, it is certanly not everyones cup of tea. The reason I removed the link hours before you responded with your wall of anger is, that I do agree that beta work should not be read by everyone.

Telling people to behave morally on an anonymous forum seems senseless. If I feel like doing something, I will do it as long as it doesn't violate any laws.
