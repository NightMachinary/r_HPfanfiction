I have removed the link for now. However, I see your reasoning as flawed. It's always fun to see people use the moral high ground fallacy. There is no problem with taking something that is free and redistributing it for the benefit of everyone. If the author doesn't want me to see his Fic, he can keep it private. He instead choose to make people jump through hoops to gain access. That is ofc his decision, but I don't think you can fault people for creating shortcuts.

edit: Dromeo has provided sound reasoning of why the link should stay removed.
