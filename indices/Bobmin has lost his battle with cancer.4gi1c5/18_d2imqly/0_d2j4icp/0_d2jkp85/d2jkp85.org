[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7591040/1/The-Queen-who-fell-to-Earth][The Queen who fell to earth]] is good, it was the first in their final trilogy. The final of which he obviously cannot finish, but he posted his plan so you at least get to see that.

The longest of any of their stories is [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunset over Britain]] you need to be a site member to read it. This is one of the best stories I've read. A disclaimer of sorts, it was written just before HPB came out, so the things they write which seem like cliche's were definitely written before they became cliche's (and not every one of their stories is a Ron/Dumbledore bashing thing, they usually are pretty positive on them.) But it's still creative and amazing!
