I can't believe that. Bob was one of the first FF authors I ever read, and his story Parallels was probably /the/ story that got me so into FF in general. He helped change my life, even if he doesn't know it. Fuck that stupid fucking cancer bullshit. It took away one of the most fun and batshit crazy writers I've ever read. RIP Bob, you deserved better. But rest assured in the knowledge that as long as I live, your memory and your stories will live on.
