I have one fic with a bad case of author's block. Basically, it started out as a oneshot, but people kept asking for more and I had the idea for a longer fic floating around. So I decided to just use the oneshot as chapters 1 and 2 for the longer story. And that part worked.

But looking back, my intended plot surpassed my ability as a writer, leading to a few compromises I'm not happy with today. But the biggest issue is that a lot of scenes I envisioned work well in a movie or video game (long, panoramic shots with music underlying it, chases, tense spy stuff), but don't do so well in writing. I had basically envisioned scenes for a movie, but turning that into a written word without constantly repeating myself, well is still beyond my abilities tbh. I can write naval battles and space stuff no sweat, but give me a something akin to an Indian Jones Temple scene, and I'll stare at a blank screen for hours.
