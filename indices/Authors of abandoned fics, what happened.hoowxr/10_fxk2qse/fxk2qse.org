I had a decently successful pair of fics (by decently successful, I mean 300ish favs, so not actually huge) on ff.net for Mass Effect, but had some weird technical issues to the point where I literally couldn't access the account.

As in, I attempted to log in with my old email and it gave me a brand new account. I didn't have the willpower to repost on other sites or under a new account, so they're just abandoned now. It's not really a huge loss, considering they were written some years ago, and I can see some pretty big flaws, but it's rather irritating I can't go back and fix them at the very least.
