For the Spiral, I stepped back and recognized that I had planned a tragic course for the characters and I could tell even the rare devoted followers were getting burnt out by it. Yet, I can't change what I intended to write. It's like the events have happened (more or less) and to move forward I would have to simply lay them out as planned or the story won't be 'right'.

For Polter, I hit a knot where too many things can happen next and I have to decide which path makes the most sense. Then I have to decide which path would be most interesting to recount; some things really are better if you just tell rather than show. It's like finding an error in stitching where you have to back out a few rows and you find another error which had caused the first one, but the fix for that opens up a whole different set of possible patterns to follow. Essentially a case of analysis paralysis.
