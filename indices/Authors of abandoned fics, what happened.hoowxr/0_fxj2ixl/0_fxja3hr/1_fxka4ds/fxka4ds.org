I once found a fic on ffnet which I thought was interesting and got super into it. Around the 20k mark i began to read the ANs and realised I wrote it. Arrogant maybe ? Idk. It was really embarrassing later. But I've forgotten a lot of fics. Actually I recently discovered that I never posted around 30k worth of chapters to a story I wrote about a year ago.
