For me, it's almost always depression stopping me. Not just because depression is inherently demotivating (it definitely is that), but also because like... When I write a tense or emotional scene, I also /feel/ that emotion, and when I'm already unstable then it's hard to write scenes that are emotionally intense, even though that's usually all I want to write.

That aside, I like what some of these other comments said because it's totally true: the plans I have for a story can fall through in the process of writing it, and I have to reassess. Or I can be bogged down by my own inability to tackle something in a previous chapter & it's put me in an untenable position later. Or I get frustrated that I can't put what's in my head on the page -- the unfortunate plight of all artists, I'm afraid.
