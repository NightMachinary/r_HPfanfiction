I am not an author of an abandoned story, but my sister is. For her the change was that her perspective in life radically shifted as she grew up and the stories she once found to be engaging and interesting suddenly seemed childish to her, including her own. Eventually she grew to resent Harry Potter as a whole depite loving it so much as a child due to the way people continued to harrass her for her unfinished work.
