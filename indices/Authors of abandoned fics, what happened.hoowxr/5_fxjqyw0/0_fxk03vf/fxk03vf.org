I will never get the entitlement of people who continue to harass authors to update. They owe you NOTHING. You are reading this for free, it's a hobby for the writer and if they choose to stop they can do that. Also, these people who always write comments on regularly updated Fanfics and ask for an update??? As if they will update their story after you demanded it. Sometimes I wish you could block from reading your story altogether
