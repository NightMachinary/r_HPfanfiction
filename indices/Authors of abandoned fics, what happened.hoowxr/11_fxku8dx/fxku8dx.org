So, coming from the perspective of someone who's just picked up their fic after about 2 years' abandonment, and in no particular order:

- I wrote myself into a corner and wasn't able to write myself out of it - I'm still not happy with its resolution, but it completely killed my ability to write the story.
- I was (and remain) unhappy with how flat the characters felt - as a fix-it, and predominantly featuring OCs, I didn't like how little conflict I was injecting into the story.
- I wasn't comfortable with the writing style - as I matured as a writer (partly through writing the fanfic!) I started to realise that it didn't entirely suit me.

I've picked the story up again in part because of lockdown and in part because I'm trying to get back into writing - but the mental load of writing fanfiction, especially if you get not very much feedback for it, can be pretty hefty!
