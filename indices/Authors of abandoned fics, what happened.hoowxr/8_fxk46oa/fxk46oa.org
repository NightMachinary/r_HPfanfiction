It got away from me. I had a great plot and some great ideas and the story just flowed from my fingers onto the keyboard. But then after 60,000 words in I looked at my outline and everything was different. The characterization wasn't what I wanted, things weren't happening how and where and when I had intended them to happen. So I read my own story, and I hated it. As I was writing it felt right, but as a reader it was trash.
