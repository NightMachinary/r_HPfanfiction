One of my stories a plot line I started writing accidentally became too close to home. I haven't yet been able to return to it, though I hope to at some point.

Another one I had plenty of positive reviews but a few really negative ones just ended up getting to me and I ended up hating it. Once something becomes a chore, it kills a story. I'm hoping to return to that one at some point soon too, but right now I have more fun writing other stuff.
