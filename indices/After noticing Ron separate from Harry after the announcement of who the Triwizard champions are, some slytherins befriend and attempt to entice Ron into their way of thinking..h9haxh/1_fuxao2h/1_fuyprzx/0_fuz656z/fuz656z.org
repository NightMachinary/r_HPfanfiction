While I mostly agree here, there's one thing that confuses me: besides disliking Slytherin because of Malfoy and Snape (understandable), why would Harry dislike Slytherin by virtue of having to face them in Quidditch? That's like saying he dislike Hufflepuff because of the same reason (and he actually got along with Cedric, despite being very much a Quidditch rival whenever applicable).
