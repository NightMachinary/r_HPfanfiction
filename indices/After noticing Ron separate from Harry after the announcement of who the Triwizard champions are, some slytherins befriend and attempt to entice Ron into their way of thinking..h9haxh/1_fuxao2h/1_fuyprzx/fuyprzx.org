On the flip side, I'm struggling to come up with a reason why the Slytherin(s) would go for Ron, particularly one that has nothing to do with Harry. You have to stick with canon at the beginning here and his claim to fame is Harry Potter's best friend. Ron's not going to take kindly to being asked a bunch of Harry Potter related questions by anyone at that point.

Also, while I agree Ron doesn't hate all Slytherins, the Weasleys are anti-Slytherin enough for Ron to think his parents, Cedrella's son included, would be disappointed if he landed there.

And as far as I can remember, Ron interacts with 3 Slytherins for most of his 6 yrs. Of course he's going to /appear/ less anti-Slytherin than Hermione, who is bullied by a gang of girls + Malfoy, and Harry, who has to deal with Malfoy, Snape, and an entire Quidditch team, but I don't think those two are anymore anti-Slytherin than Ron is.
