Ron Weasley completely hating all these "Slimy Snakes from Slytherin" comes from Fanon. In Canon, Ron is pretty neutral toward the house (as in "could not care less about them"), and is probably the member of the Trio who would get along the best with them (while Harry is the one showing the most anti Slytherin sentiment, even if it's because "they dislike him cause he keeps beating them at Quidditch").

In the books, Ron only shows a big dislike toward Malfoy (which is justified) as well as his cronies, and does not believe in blood purity (which is supposed to come from Salazar Slytherin himself), but never talked about the other members of the House. Even the "all the wizards who turned bad came from Slytherin) originaly comes from Hagrid and has been given to Ron in the movies (because reasons?).

Also, according to the "Black Familly Tree", Ron's grandmother is Cedrella Black (blasted from the familly tree for marrying Septimus Weasley). Since all the Blacks (with the exception of Sirius) seem to have gone to Slytherin, it would be really stupid for Ron to hate the House where his own grandmother came from.
