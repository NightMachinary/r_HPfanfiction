As much as I would love to see a realistic portrayal of Ron as a bad guy, this one is too tough for me to consider. Unless it is a oneshot where Ron essentially tells the Slytherins to fuck off, any author writing it would have a ton of work to do explaining why the most anti-Slytherin member of an anti-Slytherin family would be willing to join up with a "bunch'a snakes", no matter how PO'd he was at Harry.
