I'm not sure how this author normally writes, but this was quite exhausting. Its written as if he had a secret challenge going on to produce the longest sentence possible, with the most diverse use of the entirety of the biggest dictionary he could find.

Having said that, its good for fanfiction standards. I'll keep looking.
