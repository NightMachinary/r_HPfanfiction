  /ES: Who is Harry's godmother?/

  JKR: Didn't have one.

  /ES: Really?/

  JKR: Well, Sirius never had time to get a girlfriend, let alone marry.

  /ES: They could have just picked some other close friend of the family./

  JKR: At the time that they christened Harry, they were in hiding. This was not going to be a widely attended christening, because he was already in danger. So this is something they were going to do very quietly, with as few people as possible, that they wanted to make this commitment with Sirius. And --- yeah. Can't say much more.
