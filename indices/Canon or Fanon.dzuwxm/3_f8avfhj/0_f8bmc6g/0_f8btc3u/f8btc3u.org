I am always sho ked by the level of inaccuracies when it is simply a matter of logic, the black sisters being triplets makes no sense and even if that were the case, we know Narcissa and lucius are really close in age,, and that they were older than the marauderers year, I always assume Alice being one or two above them, maybe three but not really more than that
