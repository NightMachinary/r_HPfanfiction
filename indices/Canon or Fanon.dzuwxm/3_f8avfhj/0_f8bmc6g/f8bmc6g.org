They most certainly were not. Alice Longbottom was an Auror (which takes 3) years), distinguished herself as one and had a son (I'm assuming that there's some kind of maternity leave). Given that Lily died 3 years after graduation, the timeline simply doesn't match. Then again, most people have the Black sisters and the Marauders in one year, even when Bellatrix is 9 years older than James and even Narcissa was in her sixth year when the Marauders started Hogwarts.
