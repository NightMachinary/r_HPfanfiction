The original definition is "a collection or list of sacred books accepted as genuine". In the case of fiction, it refers to the version of the story that is considered official (either by the creator or the consumer, so in some instances what material actually is canon can be disputed).

Fanon, as far as I'm aware, is just a play on canon like you said. It tends to be used about things like (in this fandom) magical cores, marriage contracts, lordships, etc. that have become so ingrained in the fandom consciousness that they're used without question in many fics, rather than for things that an individual author comes up with.
