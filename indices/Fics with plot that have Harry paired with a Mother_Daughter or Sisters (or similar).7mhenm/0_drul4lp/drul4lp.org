[[/https://kinsfire.fanficauthors.net/Forever_Yours_and_Yours/index/][This story]] by the infamous Kinsfire has Harry in a three-way relationship with Hermione and her mother. While it has a plot, it's a pretty crap story though--like most of what Kinsfire wrote. (Case in point: Harry's seed is apparently so deliciously potent, a coupling with said mother is sufficient to turn her into a witch.)
