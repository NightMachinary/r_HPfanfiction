I remember reading this one quite a while back. It is abandoned of course, and quite old. I do not remember if it is well written or if it even has a decent plot.

Absolutely no clue about this one. Might be interesting.

If I remember more, I will come back and make an edit.

Unfortunately, finding an actual decent, well written plot is going to be hard. Hopefully someone comes along and recommends something you really like :D
