Not a bad "day in the life" one-shot, but not a particularly great one either. Honestly, the writing suffers from a bit of a lack of focus and some spotty editing, which detracts from the ending. Story lines introduced early aren't resolved and what's there seems a bit much just to add a bit of texture. The ending was a tad weak as well. On the plus side, the Harry/Ron banter was entertaining for the most part, easy and fluid, which is what made the story.
