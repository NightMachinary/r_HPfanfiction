I recommend these fics as good starter Dramione fics when they're 20+, these authors are well-known in the Dramione community, I also suggest you check out their other fics, not all of them will be when DHr are 20+ but they are very well written

Summer of the Dragon linkffn(7810469) and its sequel Fighting for the Malfoys linkffn(8368860) by Lena Phoria - the first book has a good sense of adventure and explores a few different aspects of magic and wandlore that I thought was pretty interesting, the second book is a more of a relationship-oriented fic with some angst and kidnapped!Hermione

How to Win Friends and Influence People linkffn(12531992) by OlivieBlake - my favorite badass!Hermione characterization, very long and definitely an ensemble character fic as the summary describes, but don't let the word count scare you, it's worth the read

The Wrong Strain linkffn(12307855) by Colubrina - a different take on a Veela fic with a Veela!Hermione

You've read Isolation, but anything by bex-chan is simply fantastic, to fit your target age I'd suggest Hunted linkffn(5853767)

And to add a bit of shameless self-promo on the end of this, I've written a VoldemortWins!AU with hints of a secret past relationship linkffn(13099028)
