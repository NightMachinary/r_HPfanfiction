Colubrina was already mentioned but she's absolutely my favorite Dramione author - The Muddy Princess and Lady of the Lake are both good (I'm very different ways) as is The Green Girl if you want to check out Hermione sorted into Slytherin story (honestly the best one I've read. And, if you ever decide to try out a Hermione/Tom Riddle, Pygmalion is the absolute best.
