There are already some wonderful recommendations in this thread; I'd add 'Of Kings and Queens' and 'Out of Mind' to that list.

Linkffn(8227894) Of Kings and Queens is a post-war fic, where Draco is hounded by society and on the verge of bankruptcy. But Hermione has a problem too, which puts them both on a clashing course. Really well written, both fluffy and quite deep at times.

Linkffn(10916225) The second fic, 'Out of Mind', is phenomenal. It's only 10k words. Really evokes a lot feelings.
