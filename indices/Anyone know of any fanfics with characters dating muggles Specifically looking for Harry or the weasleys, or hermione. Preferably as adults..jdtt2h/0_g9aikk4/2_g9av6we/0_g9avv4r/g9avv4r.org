I do realise that the concept of half-bloods is dependent on marrying Muggles, but canon never actually shows us an example of it working out.

Harry is defined as half-blood, but only because his mother was muggle-born, not from a wizard marrying a muggle. Likewise the Tonks family, except in reverse, with the father being muggle-born. Dean Thomas might actually be half-blood, but his father left because the divide between their worlds put Dean's mother in danger. Seamus recounts (possibly just in the movies) that his father /didn't know/ he'd married a witch until after the fact, and that it was a shock. Tom Riddle is a half-blood, and we all know how well that worked.

If there are any canonical cases of successful marriages between wizards/witches and Muggles, then they are entirely off-screen.
