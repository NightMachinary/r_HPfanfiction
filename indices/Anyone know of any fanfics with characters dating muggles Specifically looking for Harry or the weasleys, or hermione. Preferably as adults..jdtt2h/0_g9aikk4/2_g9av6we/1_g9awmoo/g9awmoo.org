There is a fundamental difference between "one spouse plays an instrument and the other does not," which is simply a hobby, or at most a career, and which the other could participate in and learn to do if they're sufficiently interested, vs "one spouse can perform magic and the other can't." Not that it couldn't possibly work, but that the gap is a very real obstacle.

Consider a relationship where one spouse is able-bodied, even athletic, but the other was born entirely crippled from the neck down, and also blind and with a shortened life expectancy. If they are sufficiently dedicated and selfless, then they might be happy together, but it would be challenging for them. There would be many things that they can't share, from artwork to any kind of physical activity (including intimacy). The disabled spouse could very easily feel like a burden, and that's in the best-case scenario where they actually appreciate what it's like to be able-bodied (which, having been born as they are, they might not). And even if they are such outstanding people that they can work through all of that, their life together would be inevitably shortened.

Yes, a power imbalance on the level of magic vs mundane is significant.
