My favourite Harry Potter joke remains a meme from no later than 2013:

you have found Tom Riddle's calculator; this will be much harder to stab [written on the screen of a graphic calculator]

Or possibly the toilet graffiti from school: "the chamber of secrets has been opened, enemies of the heir beware". I swear, basically the only memorable toilet graffiti I've seen.
