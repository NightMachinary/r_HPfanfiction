I haven't been able to find it again but I remember reading a fic where the magicical world has m-mail, and its been proven that it is impossible to send a spell through m-mail. Of course Harry doesn't know its impossible, so as a project he decides to try it and succeeds.

The teachers decide to not teach him any of magical theory that states that some result is impossible and he proceeds to violate most of the known magical laws.

Very much an overpowered Harry, but it was an amusing story.
