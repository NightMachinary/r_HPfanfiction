I wasn't trying to "call the author out" I was just giving a warning in the vain of; This story has Ron bashing if that's not your thing, or; This story bashes (blank) unnecessarily. So if someone is muslim or something they know before they read the story where Harry goes on a Holy-war to exterminate muslims... That is way different from (for example) me going to the reviews and getting in an argument with the author.
