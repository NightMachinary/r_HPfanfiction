I like linkffn(Madam Minister by GreenWoodElf), focused on the first female British Minister for Magic, though it predates the Pottermore info on her. Sadly unfinished but 69k is a decent amount of material. They also have linkffn(Willoway by GreenWoodElf), which is also sadly incomplete but features Tonks on an Auror mission.

Also perhaps linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7320819/1/The-Ladies-of-Godric-s-Hollow][The Ladies of Godric's Hollow by tetleybag]]).
