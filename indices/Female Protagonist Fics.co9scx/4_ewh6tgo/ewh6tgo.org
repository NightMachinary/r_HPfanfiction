Here's one: linkffn(The Divide by Beedle)

It's technically a next-gen fic (set while Harry and co's kids are at Hogwarts), but the protagonists are OC twin girls who are inseparable - until one gets her Hogwarts letter.

Juliet and Jennifer are creative, spirited, and determined to figure out a way to stay together - even if it means making questionable choices in the quest to make Jen a witch too.
