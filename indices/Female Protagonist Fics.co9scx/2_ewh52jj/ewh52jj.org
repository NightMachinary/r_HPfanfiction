If you're interested in American OCs, the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1211079][Alexandra Quick series]] has just started its much-awaited fifth book. Extensive worldbuilding (this was first written pre-Ilvermorny), interesting characters, a pretty good plot.

There's also linkffn(11111990) Grow Young With Me, which is an OC/Harry romance that's very well written and has some of the most believable kids I've seen (it's a post-DH fic).
