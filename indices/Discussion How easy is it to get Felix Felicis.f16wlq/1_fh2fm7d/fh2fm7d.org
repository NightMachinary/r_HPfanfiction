So, a little bit of "Hearthstone Pro Player Talk", but its relevant.

In hearthstone (and most other sports/games with elements of randomness), a lot of people who aren't good at the game will look at Pro Players and say "They only won because they got lucky."

That's true, but thats not all there is to it. They got lucky because they put themselves into the position to be lucky. They put in the work for that luck to happen.

As far as I know in canon, Felix Felicis takes a long time to brew and is known for being rather difficult to brew, along with (maybe) requiring a couple rare ingredients. But Super Carlin brothers have a video talking about how most of the ingredients for the potion are used in other potions (pepper ups, things that make you feel better) but none with any "lucky' effects. And after that video I looked at the Luck Potion differently.

We've already used Hearthstone to determine that a big part of being lucky is setting yourself up for it. So what if the long process for brewing the relatively non-magical (while rare[maybe]) ingredients together is a way of /magically/ setting yourself up for beibg lucky, or storing luck up for later?

If you're sat inside your house all day for months straight doing nothing but brewin a potion, you're not setting yourself up to be lucky. Yeah, nothing unlucky will probably come your way, but neither will something lucky. And where will all that luck go?

Into the potion.

The only problem with that is you need to be in a extremely luck neutral environment. Running counter to your own head cannon, any lucky things that happen to you while brewing would take away the "ambient luck" that would go to the potion, and cause it to be less potent or even fail depending on how lucky you got.

And that also explains why its so hard to make. Think about the all the little ways that you get lucky in your normal day.
