My personal head canon is that brewing Felix involves bottling your /own/ luck, at least for the duration of the brew. Everything that can go wrong, will go wrong.

And that's why it's so devilishly tricky to brew, you need to have such a degree of skill and preparation that there's not even a /chance/ to make a mistake thanks to bad luck.
