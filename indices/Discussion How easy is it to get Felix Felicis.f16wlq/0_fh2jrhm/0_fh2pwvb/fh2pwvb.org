This is from Seventh Horcrux, right? Very good fic!

It also takes 6 months to brew. Imagine cooking one meal for 6 months, and then multiply that difficult by 50, since potions are more difficult and precise than cooking normal meals.

It's also addicting. I bet you can only use it once or twice a century.

Edit: Not sure why you got downvoted. Upvoted ya. Why does this sub downvote so many comments? :/
