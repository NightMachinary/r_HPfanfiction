My headcanon on Felix Felicis is that it isn't really all that hard to make, but that it isn't really practically useful at anything but mundane events.

Basically, I headcanon Felix as homing in on your innermost and deepest desires, and manipulates your decision-making in order to get closer to them. This makes it worse than useless as a wartime potion, for example, because Felix would simply tell you to leave the war and do something you actually /want/ to do instead. For this reason, Felix is mostly just useful to solve mundane teenage troubles (love drama and whatnot) or similar things, and few people would bother spending half a year on a potion merely to get a good date, for example. The reason it was useful for Harry was that his deepest wishes basically boils down to getting free from Voldemort -- ergo, winning the war.
