I've got a fic or Series which i would highly rec you. It's wolfstar but Remus is a bit darker, just in a sense that he is battling his own demons and it's Sirius' pov. There is smut but the characters are so well written that I have to rec it here despite it might not being exactly what you look for. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9809804]])

In this WIP, Remus plays more of a supportive role but there are 2 chapters from his pov so you might be interested. Linkao3(The Master of Death by Quine)

One of my fav. Time travel fics. Harry and Hermione land in the Marauders era. Linkao3(Time Turned Back by TaraSoleil)
