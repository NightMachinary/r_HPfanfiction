my time travel fic (draw the curtain back for Venus on Ao3) had that: - he died (i had it be the death in deathly hallows, but it can be wherever) - magical nonsense had previously weakened the link between body and soul/magic - i said that it was frequent use of the polyjuice potion, but it could easily be an animagus transformation, a curse, etc. - he was really fuckin' angry and managed to catapult himself into the past when he was in Kings Cross Station b/c its Harry Potter, hes just Like That.

this worked cause: - its kinda wishy-washy and symbolic, so it allowed me to do all sorts of wishy-washy symbolic nonsense later - we already know that Shit Happens in the potterverse when u die, w/ the trains and dumbledore and all that, so 'accidental time travel' isnt too far out of the question. - its got enough scientific-sounding stuff to it that it doesnt sound like i've pulled it out of my ass (I hope) - i talked about 'fully self-transfigurative magic,' and 'degregation of the mind-body link' which sounds fully thought-out
