The beautiful part of Harry Potter is its /magical/, so you really have endless possibilities. I'll list a few that I've seen or thought about.

Honestly just steal an idea from any dimension travel story that already exists. Readers really won't care how they got there, /but rather what happens once they arrive/.

The Veil. Only the master of death can use this as a mode of transportation. Consumes the Deathly Hallows, without the hallows one cannot traverse it so he is effectively stuck.

A ritual of sorts. Rituals are never really explained much in canon, so you've got a lot of leeway here. All rituals have a cost (my headcanon), perhaps the cost does not allow them to use the ritual again.

Harry was an unspeakable and some experiment went haywire.

Delenda Est uses a [[/spoiler][Black family heirloom, a hairclip to travel back in time. One must impale themselves with it]], you could adapt it so the cost of returning is their future life.

Disorder of the Phoenix is a currently updating fic that had a singularly unique way of transportion back to fifth year. The plot is meh, (I ditched it when he tried to force H/Tonks) but it is a unique take on travel back to fifth year like you wanted. linkffn(12813755)
