Instead of a time turner, you could try writing Harry going to the exact place where time turners are made. Or you can try incorporating the Department of Mysteries. There are actually a lot of other ways as well considering it takes place in a world of /magic/. The ones I listed are not that original now that I think about it. How about setting off some sort of curse in the Catacombs of Paris or in the Pyramids of Egypt or setting off an old curse in general? I don't think I have read a story like that before.
