You should make it so that the time travel method is not reusable or usable by others who they inform in the past. A lot of the time the mechanism is not thought through so the best choice for time travelers would be to immediately go tell Dumbledore that he can prevent the Holocaust by reusing their method. There are a few ways you can do this. You can make the time travel the consequence of an unreplicable accident. You can make it extremely unethical. You can give it extreme magical power requirements. You can make it so people can only spread a minimal amount of information from the future - this would require handwavy physics. You can give Dumbledore ethical qualms about time travel for weird Dumbledorian reasons. Or you can ignore the plot hole entirely, as many good stories do. But if you're trying to make the time travel realistic, figuring out how to deal with this would be a very good start.

Actually, I just thought of a really cool idea. You could have your travelers go back in time, tell Dumbledore that he can prevent the Holocaust by reusing their method, expecting to blink into nonexistence after he leaves, only to find that their method of time travel works via alternate universes, and they are now stranded in a universe with a Voldemort but no Dumbledore.
