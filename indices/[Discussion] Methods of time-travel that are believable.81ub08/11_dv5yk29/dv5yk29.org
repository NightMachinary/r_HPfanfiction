Collect 35 Erumpet Horns and place seven at each corner of a pentagram. Then levitate them all into the air and let them drop while snorting a pile of time-sand.

The Erumpet Horns will blast you out of the timeline into the new one. Consequence is, of course, that if you don't succeed you'll just die in an Erumpet Horn explosion.
