Thoughts About It: Alright, so this picks up immediately after the Battle of Hogwarts, and is all about Draco trying to figure out who he is and what he believes as he comes to turn with everything that happened in basically his entire life. This fic is notable because it has the pathetic, whiny, father's boy Draco of canon instead of some brilliant, skilled Slytherin sex god. I first started reading this about a year ago, I think, and it has had 4 or 5 updates since then, so it has a couple times a year update rate, which while not the greatest is definitely not the worst.
