Snakes and Lions is my favorite fic featuring Draco. It's a Harry/Draco friendship, with very light slash close to the end. The sequel is somewhat slashy though.

It's complete.

I like it a lot, because it gives an interesting, almost intuitive portrayal of the social interactions in Hogwarts. As well, the fics tangles lightly with a few philosophical concepts - like what friendship trully means and the merits/downsides of utilising dark magic.The characters are alive and heastrong, and the setting feels magical. The pacing is fluid and characterization superb.

It's a sixth year fic, published just before OttP came out.
