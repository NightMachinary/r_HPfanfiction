/Winter's Debt/: Old story, written pre-OoTP, so Draco is somewhat OoC. The premise is that Draco has a younger sister, who has been hidden away by his father. This is one of the few fics that humanise Draco without redeeming him. Oneshot. linkffn(1245134)

/The Malfoy Case/: Draco/Astoria. Post War Legal Drama, Astoria is Draco's advocate. Very well done redemption arc. linkffn(10202355)

/Draco Malfoy and the Trials of single Parenthood/: Really well written family fic that takes place two months after Astoria's death. Some touching father-son moments between Draco and Scorpius. Draco and Ron friendship, too. It works surprisingly well. linkffn(12089286)

/The House that Cedric Built/: Eighth year fic. The premise is that all the returning seventh years form a new Hogwarts house, the Diggory house, in Cedric's memory. This is one of the few house unity fics that doesn't feel cheesy or contrived. linkffn(6406102)

/Traitorous Hearts/: Draco/Astoria DH fic. Has a shaky start in terms of writing and dialogue, but gets better as the story progresses. linkao3(6671233)

/The albatross did follow/: Ginny's a curse breaker who's been tasked to find a missing Draco Malfoy. Time travel with infinite time loop. linkffn(11128944)

/Bend it Like Weasley/: Draco coaches a new all-girls quidditch team at Hogwarts. Started before OotP. Complete. linkffn(1349676)
