Obliviate is an odd one. If it actually existed as something that could be used on magicals without detection, as many fanfics do, then every magical government in the world would by logical necessity be the worst totalitarian state ever invented, with the Obliviation squad its secret police. Anyone in opposition gets handled quicker and easier than anything in /1984/ and then everyone gets back to their lives.

I've read some fanfics that explore that concept, but I'm not interested in writing stories like that. So my idea is, it is actually ridiculously easy to use on Muggles (and maybe squibs) and very, very hard to use on magicals or magical creatures. There is also a separate, unnamed charm Hermione and others use that is /also/ apparently not commonplace for use on magicals.

Some examples from canon: Tom Riddle hits a house elf with that cover up murder and his theft of the cup he turns into a Horcrux and no one even thinks to try and check for such a thing when investigating. He does another memory charm on his uncle, and everyone is likewise fooled, as if such magic simply doesn't exist or isn't ever used (or their law enforcement is just that bad and/or corrupt).

But Barty Crouch Sr. blows one, wiping Bertha Jorkins' memory far too much. You'd think someone with his experience would do better. However, we also have Hermione doing the modifying memory charm on her parents without any problem, as well as multiple ministry officials having no known problems also using it on lots and lots of Muggles, thousands even.

In fact, it seems that other than Lockhart (and it isn't clear he was always successful), only skilled people even /try/ using it on magical people, namely Hermione, Dumbledore, and Shacklebolt. There are lots of situations where a simple Obliviate would have solved a /lot/ of problems, especially for people who have no problem with assault and murder, so the best canon-wrangling I've got is that doing so on a witch or wizard is simply outside almost everyone's skills. That would explain people not instantly thinking someone like Lockhart is doing something wrong (and law enforcement incompetence on memory spell use in general) and also Voldemort not thinking his agents who are acting strange in DH after running into the Trio have been memory charmed by 17-year-olds (because he doesn't take into account the Hermione factor).
