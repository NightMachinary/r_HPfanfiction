I'd imagine the intent and concentration of the caster would make the difference. You can change a memory, or remove it completely. It is a "memory charm" not a "mind wipe charm".

Done badly, you could end up pulling a Lockhart. Done in haste you leave gaps in the memory which would be like a blackout...or missing time. Done well, the subject would never know anything was amiss as they have a fuzzy memory of something happening that was probably not really worth paying attention to at the time.

Kind of the same way that notice-me-not charms or muggle-repelling charms would not actually "hide" an item, only make your eyes slide away from it, or immediately think you have something else you were supposed to be doing.
