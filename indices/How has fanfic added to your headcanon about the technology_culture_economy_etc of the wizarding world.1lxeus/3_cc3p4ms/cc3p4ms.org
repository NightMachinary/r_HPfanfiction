I, like many others, have operated under the assumption that the Memory Charm 'Obliviate' operated in a way similar to the neuralyzer from Men in Black- once zapped, the victim was open to suggestion as to what should replace the missing memories. Then JKR/Steve Kloves confused the issue in Deathly Hallows, when Hermione wipes her parents' memories of her and sends them off to Australia under different identities, then turns around (after she, Harry and Ron defeat some Death Eaters that pursued them from the wedding) to say she's never done a Memory Charm before.

Sometimes fanon just works better.
