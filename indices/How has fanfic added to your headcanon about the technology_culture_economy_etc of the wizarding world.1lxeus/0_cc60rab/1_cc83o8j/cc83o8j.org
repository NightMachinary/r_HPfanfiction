Sort of. The origins of this spell are likely some terrifying mpreg fic lost to the mists of time, according to DLP boffins. But most modern fanon is likely drawing on what Hermione uses when setting up camp in /Hermione Granger and the Horcrux Camping Trip/... I mean, Book #7.

Those spells appeared to do some odd stuff in the movie version, which was different from the book in a lot of ways (most of them good). So it wasn't created whole-cloth from nothing, at least in the most modern use, but it is very much a fanon thing now.
