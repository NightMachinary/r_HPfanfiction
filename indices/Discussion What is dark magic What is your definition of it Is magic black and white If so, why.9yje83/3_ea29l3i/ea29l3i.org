My favorite definition was in linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) where Dark Magic is just magic kept secret within a family. Any magic where the counter is either unknown or secret would fall in this category. /Petrificus Totalus/ and /Stupify/ are all basic spells now, but imagine how terrifying and evil they must have seemed when no one knew how to reverse them.

Of course, I would consider /Obliviate/ to be dark magic under this definition because the only known counter is extensive torture (Bertha Jorkins) or possibly many years of therapy (Gilderoy Lockhart).
