Well, what would you consider 'Dark Magic'? Is a love potion Dark? What about using /diffindo/ to cut someone's throat? Most of the spells can be used to kill or incapacitate someone if you think about it. Imagine something innocuous like /duro/ (turning objects to stone). Cast it on a person's clothing, and they are effectively petrified because they cannot move at all.
