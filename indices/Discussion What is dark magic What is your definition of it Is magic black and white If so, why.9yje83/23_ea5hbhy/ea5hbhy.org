I have a rather derivative view of magic that I've been developing. I see it as spirits enacting spells according to instructions developed through wand use over generations.

In this model, Dark magic involves tasking a spirit (usually one more inclined to be cruel) to continuously reapply a curse. Dark animations and cursed items involve a vicious spirit being impelled to take over an item and wait to trigger an attack.
