Your first point is valid, but I think it would be apt to split it into two categories:

First, there is magic that is deleterious to the target. That is, magic that is always dangerous to be hit by (i.e. your gun example). You might be able to use this for moral good, like a gun in self defense or for hunting food, but these are spells that you cannot fire without /something/ breaking.

And second, magic that is deleterious to the /caster./ We know that magic can turn against it's user; obscurials are a prime example of this (or, if you count /Wonderbook: Book of Spells/ as canon, the Patronus if cast by someone impure of heart). While that is an extreme example, it is /possible/ that there are spells that extract a (possibly metaphysical or metaphorical) toll from the user to cast. How much is fanon-vs-canon is up for debate, but the affect of Horcruxes on Voldemort's mind may be one such example; the whole "splitting the soul" thing is definitely another.

To continue on the Horcrux example, if you removed the necessary murder, soul mutilation, and (possible) sanity drain, what do you have? The ultimate preventative medicine! Why die when you can just tell Death /no?/ But instead, you have a drain on morality (murder), spirituality (soul mutilation) and sanity that makes the spell almost entirely too costly for all but the most insane and despirate of dark wizards.
