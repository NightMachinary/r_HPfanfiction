I think the best way to look at "dark magic" is as an item of language which is used in a number of different ways (as language often is). It is a mistake to ask "What is Dark Magic?" because there is no single answer. Context is what distinguishes between the different meanings, only one of which relates to a "natural kind".

"Dark magic" can mean:

- Magic which is inherently dangerous (in which practice of dark magic might be compared with the ownership of firearms).

- Magic which can only be used for evil ends, or is apt to immoral use.

- Magic which is gruesome.

- Magic which is cast by a Dark wizard.

- Magic which has a special magical property which makes it impossible to reverse without knowledge of the specific counter (the "natural kind" meaning).

There is overlap between the categories but they are not coextensive.
