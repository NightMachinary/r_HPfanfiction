"Dark Magic" has two meanings. In common use, "dark" magic is any magic that a government tries to suppress.

As understood by magical theorists and practitioners of the dark arts, dark magic is any magic that requires a specific emotion from the caster (/brewer/ritualist/etc.). This includes the Cruciatus curse, the Patronus charm, possibly the Fidelius, and others.

Dark magic is corrupting because in order to use it reliably, you either have to walk around stewing in $emotion all the time, or you have to condition yourself to feel whatever emotion you need on command.
