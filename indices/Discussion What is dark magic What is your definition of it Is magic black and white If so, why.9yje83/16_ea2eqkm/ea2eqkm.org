I see it as being intent based. Really, I see all magic as being intent based.

The unforgiveables have a primary intent of killing, causing pain, or subverting will, and cannot be blocked with magic (short of conjuring a physical object to shield). It's canon that at least the cruciatus requires malicious intent to cast, but the other two /can/ have non-malicious uses, so that's where intent falls in.They wouldn't be inherently dark, but they're probably /easier/ to cast with malice than benevolence. (I don't recall off hand whether the killing curse required actual hate to fuel it)

But a different interpretation that I see happen is that the spell, ritual, or potion itself leaves like a magical residue. Much like how murder via killing curse can split the soul, actual 'dark magic' can leave an imprint, something that lingers in the psyche or on the soul. I've seen this done in a fic where it was almost like a drug - you feel power or control, or an urge to use the 'dark' method instead of other means because of the feeling it gives, and the more you use it, the more you *want* to use it. Or it makes whatever spells are classed as 'light' (like the Patronus, maybe even certain healing spells) more difficult to cast over time.

A hybrid of the two is that magic cast with 'evil' intent makes that magic dark. A healing spell used to harm someone (like removing someone's entire skull via a spell meant for removing a shattered bone) could count.
