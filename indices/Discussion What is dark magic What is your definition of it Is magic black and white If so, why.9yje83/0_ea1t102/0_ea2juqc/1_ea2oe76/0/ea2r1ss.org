We have no idea how the killing curse works. I've always had the assumption you had to hate and channel that rage and hate to power the curse. You had to want to murder the person... This is why fake!Moody says he doubted anyone could power one in fourth year.

That makes the argument that it can be used for people who want to die problematic because you are relying on dark feelings.

And Dumbledore was saying was that murder is what hurts the soul, not just the killing curse and because Dumbledore is asking, it's not murder.

Snape, being a pretty dark person with few morals probably could easily bring those emotions to the surface and use all his dislikes of Dumbledore over the years to power the curse.

Long story short... Dumbledore and Snape are very much the extreme exception... Not the norm.
