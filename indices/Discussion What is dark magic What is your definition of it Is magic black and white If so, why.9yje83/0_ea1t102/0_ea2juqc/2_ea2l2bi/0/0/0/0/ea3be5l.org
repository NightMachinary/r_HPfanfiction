Maybe, but for me I feel it helps explain why the Unforgivables are, well, unforgivable. With the Imperius you need to want to control, to dominate, to have absolute power over your intended victim. With the Cruciatus you need to want to make them suffer, to feel absolute agony. And with the Killing Curse, you need to want them dead, to rob them of any future happiness in their life.
