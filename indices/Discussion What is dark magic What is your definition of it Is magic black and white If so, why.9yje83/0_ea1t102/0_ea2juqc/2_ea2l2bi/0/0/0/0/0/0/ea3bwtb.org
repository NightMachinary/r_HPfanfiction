I was more trying to think of a reason to explain why the use of the Unforgivables is seen as being so abhorrent. You could probably replicate the level of control the Imperius gives with judicious use of Confundus Charms, Compulsion Charms, and the like; and a well aimed Severing Charm to the neck will leave someone just as dead as someone hit by the Killing Curse. So in my mind, it boils down to intent, and the kind of emotional state required to use them.
