At least the canon considers the intention to be far more important than the mean. For example, it's ok to euthanize someone with Avada Kedavra, but confunding a House-Elf to poison his master is cold-blooded murder.

Similarly, the first year entry-level spell Wingadium Leviosa can be used to levitate a big troll club and bash someone's head in.

Lethal means are always going to be used in wars. Letting some sadistic genocidal maniacs win is not really an option.

Now, things will become more complicated in following situations:

- An inner circle Death Eater has been spotted in a particular location with his family. Harry has to decide whether to take him out by blowing up the whole area, thus killing potential innocents; or risking the lives of his own people by ordering a direct assault. How should Harry choose?
- An alternative way to kill Voldemort exists, but requires sacrificing innocent children in a horrible ritual. It's guaranteed to work. Because Voldemort created Horcruxes and greatly weakened his soul, it's possible to reduce the cost of this ritual as not to involve any human sacrifices. However, the modified ritual is not guaranteed to work. Which option should Harry and his friends choose?
- A decade after the War, it was found that in addition to the Longbottoms, up to several hundreds of potential Cruciatus victims might lay around in Muggle hospitals. A potential cure is in development at DoM, but requires testing on live humans. Several Unspeakables propose to use Death Eaters convicted of murders and torture as test subjects. Some vindictive DA members also support this proposal, saying it's just fair turnaround, but they want the Trio and Neville to have the final word. How should they decide?
- After a major engagement, the DA and Order lost several people due to other's side use of the Killing Curse. Some members suggest to retaliate in kind, since Avada Kedavra bypasses the shield charm and offers significant tactical advantages. On the other hand, Avada Kedavra is still very much a taboo among the populace and its use means losing certain popular support. The leadership also worries that liberal use of this curse has adverse psychological consequences. How should they decide?
