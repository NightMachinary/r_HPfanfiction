Dark magic is that which by nature corrupts the user unto becoming a twisted version of themselves. Light Magic also does the same thing but the outcome is more along the lines of compassion/ helping as much as possible.

There's a time travel fic where the method Dumbledore counters Grindelwalds demonic power is with his own Light magic. My idea is similar to that.
