I thought faux Moody gave a pretty good answer. Its about desire. You need to get into a certain mindset in order to cast the big three. While there could be some potential good uses for AK, what it does to your state of mind and how you have to behave corrupts you. In canon, people who use the unforgivables are seen as crazed and evil. Using them exacerbates your descent into darkness.

Other 'dark' spells I think also require you to be in a certain mindset with a certain intent.
