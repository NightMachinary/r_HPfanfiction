In Harry Potter, there is some moral ambiguity to it and anything the government doesn't want the populace to know about / be taught. At least in most canon compliant fics.

I think of "Dark Magic" as having a component that requires unwilling sacrifice or intent to harm / control. I'd say without further research that most spells are probably neither light nor dark on their own, but intent matters. Painless death or slaughtering animals, controlling animals (herding, etc) or prisoners or mental patients, unless the ONLY purpose of the Cruciatus is to cause pain.... if it causes pain by lighting up nerve endings there could be theraputic uses in short spurts. I've seen it used in fics to restart a stopped heart by causing muscle cramps.

Without further information beyond "you have to mean it" then I will assume intent is what makes actions dark or light. The "dark arts" are more "unknown" or "hard to perform" or "require deep study to perform" than being "evil".

Dark Arts is like Dark Ages.
