This is mostly my GM'ing experience talking.

Dark magic is mostly a handy term for magic-aware cultures to label illegal spells restrict the use or knowledge of certain magics. most commonly reanimating the dead, dominating minds and consorting with evil outsiders. Two ethical, one practical.

The label is used sensibly in HP in regards to spells and artefacts, most of the time. If a spell exclusively or mostly has uses that facilitate breaking the law, it's dark magic. A cutting curse is arguably a flexible tool, but no one will believe you were using the entrail-expelling curse to make sausages. /Avada Kedavra/ is illegal by necessity due to the extremely limited population, despite its' potential use for defence against magical creatures. /Imperio/ is too useful for corrupting officials to be legal, whilst /Obliviate/ is crucial to maintaining the masquerade.

Now, does dark magic corrupt? Absolutely!

Most of the time, these magics are used for things that will traumatize the average person. Murder, torture, brainwashing and brutal violence are horribly illegal things that human beings are completely capable of doing /without/ magic. A practitioner can absolutely become inured to acts of dark magic, just like a government spook can get used to torturing prisoners.

I would argue that the wizarding worlds' views on the /Obliviate/ spell is symptomatic of a wider problem. The wizarding world has zero respect for the human minds' sanctity. There are mind affecting spells everywhere. Glamour spells are common fare. Suggestions are /everywhere/ and love potions are just a naughty thing teenagers do. None of these are considered even close to dark magic, and thus it's ethically okay.
