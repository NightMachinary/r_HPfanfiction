There is nothing in canon to suggest killing curse is painless. On the contrary, the description of the victims leads me to believe a lot of pain is involved. The victims faces are described as frozen in horror and pain so... No, killing curse has no up side.

The way I see it, magic is a part of a magical. When a wizard casts a spell, he is affected as well, not just the target. So, by that theory dark magic has detrimental efrects on the user.

Then there is the psychological aftereffects. Let's say Harry used the killing curse on Bella after she killed Sirius, and succeeded. That night, he learns the Prophecy and when he gets a chance to go over the days events, he begins to realise just how much pain he and those on his side could have avoided if he had just used the killing curse from the beginning. And now, with the impossible task of killing Voldemort hanging over his head, the same curse that gave him a scar looks like his only option. The next time he's in a fight is with Malfoy jr. Malfoy casts the torture curse. Harry, now rationalizing the usage of such a magic, casts the killing curse. Then does it again against Snape when the man kills Harry's mentor.

It's a slippery slope, the ability to cause such a devastation with only a few words and I doubt most could stop themselves.

So, no dark magic.
