Can't actually think of any with that specific premise since I do a terrible job of keeping track of which fics I've read, but I'm currently reading the Sacrifices series by [[https://fanfic.net][fanfic.net]] user Lightning on the Wave and it's really good! linkffn(2580283) also I assume most everyone who reads HPFF has read Prince of the Dark Kingdom, but if you haven't it is excellent despite some grammar issues and being uncompleted. I won't link to that one because it's so popular you just have to Google the title and it is the first result.

I've never used the fanfic bot before so I hope I did it right lol, and if I think of any other really good fics, especially ones with dystopian / anti-Ministry undertones I'll reply again.

I actually think the premise of Dark magic being magic the ministry doesn't like was a side-plot in an unrelated fic but I can't remember properly where I first or even most recently saw it. Sorry about that.

edit: oh, I just realized Sacrifices is wildly popular and well-known too. Sorry, I'm new to the community, before starting to get back into reddit a bit I just hunted down fanfics myself to very, very mixed results. hopefully I'll think of something more unique worth reading but for now I'm drawing a blank.
