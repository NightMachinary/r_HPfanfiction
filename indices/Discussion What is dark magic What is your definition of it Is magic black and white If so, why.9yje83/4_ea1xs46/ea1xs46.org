NOTE: Typing out "Wizards and Witches" every time is anoyying, so rather than being exclusive by using just one I'm going to use Magi

In my mind we really don't know enough about the HP magic system to make educated judgments. You hypothesize that AK is an instantaneous, completely painless death. It's possible, however it's equally possible that it rips the soul asunder and compresses all the agony a being is capable of feeling into one indescribable instant of pain. (My head cannon for the Unforgivables has always been that they directly manipulate the victims soul in some way)

As for the body bind curse...I'm amazed you can't think of any medical or law enforcement uses for this. Patient is injured and needs to be immobilized for transport? Body bind. Law enforcement officers need a less than lethal spell to subdue perps? Body Bind. Hell, for all the kinky Magi out there I'm sure it has a completely consensual role in the bedroom. As you said, it has it's more nefarious uses, but any tool can be misused

Similar things can be said for jelly legs and stupefy. Both are good less than lethal options to subdue someone for whatever reason. Hell even Obliviate has ethical uses (IMHO). It certainly wouldn't be for everyone, but if someone with PTSD wanted specific memories removed, as long as everything was well explained and consensual I think it would be completely ethical.

Now, for the dark vs light magic in general, I believe that this is mainly fanon. Certain spells like the Unforgivables, Fiend Fire, and those...zombie things...that Voldy made and certainly Horcruxes are mentioned as being "dark" but IIRC "Light" magic is never mentioned in the 7 main books. To me this implies that rather than being soul corrupting or innately evil or some such "dark" is merely a descriptor, much like We'd use "Barbaric".

Now if you're asking what I think would make something Dark Magik with a capital D. That would be the stuff that corrupts your soul. Where you sell a little bit of yourself for power and it gets replaced be something /other/. The types of things that consumes souls to fuel themselves and unwilling ones are actually better. All that jazz.
