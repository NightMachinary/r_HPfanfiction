I think a lot of what you're describing is fanon in any case. And bad writing. I've read several stories that make the points you're making, right down to explaining how wingardium leviosa can be used to float someone too high and let go.

I've also read stories where everyone goes "Oh noes! Harry must be studying dark magic. He's too powerful!"

Then I've read stories that fall into a small middle ground. Harry might use dark magic, the people around him might be a bit wary, but ultimately things go fine because of communication. Those are rarer.

If you really think every story has what you're describing, you need to get out of your comfort zone and read other stories to what you are right now.
