I think one has to contextualize the psychology of someone like Bellatrix when she says stuff like this. All of her life is framed around following an evil Lord who does dark things and /coincidentally/ is extremely powerful.

It makes total sense that from her point of view the most powerful and effective spells require total devotion to evil and hate. This kind of mindset is part of her total devotion to her way of life. I bet when she practices any kind of combat spell she would try to enhance it by using as much malice as possible.

So I guess what I'm trying to say is that she doesn't necessarily have to be lying.
