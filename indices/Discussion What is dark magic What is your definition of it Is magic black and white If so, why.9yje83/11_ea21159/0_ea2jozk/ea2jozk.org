  This also explains Avada Kedavra being an Unforgiveable -- while in theory you can use it to mercy kill, it requires invoking hate to facilitate.

The way I figure, it's not that hate is required, but that it's the easiest method. The Avada Kedavra requires an unrestricted intent to kill. When you cast this spell, you want your target to cease its existence in the most permanent manner possible, and there can be no doubt in your feeling. This is possible to do without emotion, but it's easiest to do with pure hatred.
