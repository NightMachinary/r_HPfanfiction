A common fanon explanation, and my personal headcanon, is that Dark magic depends on malicious intent and Light magic on benevolent intent. Thus, Crucio or Sectumsempra is Dark magic (hate), Expecto Patronum or Vulnera Sanentur is Light magic (love), Episkey or Levicorpus is neither (requires no particular intent beyond the normal "make this spell work" focus) despite being healing/incapacitation spells. This also explains Avada Kedavra being an Unforgiveable -- while in theory you can use it to mercy kill, it requires invoking hate to facilitate. Mercy killings could be done with less problematic spells by a combination of putting someone to sleep (I forgot the exact spell) and then kill using some other spell. Obliviate might not actually require any intent in either direction, which would explain why it's not considered Dark Magic.

Obliviate is arguably HP's most "broken" spell -- its potential for abuse is ridiculous, and even worse than the Imperius or AK -- it boosts your abilities to socially engineer people's behaviour towards your benefit to the extreme; carefully placing Obliviates on people whenever something goes wrong makes it far easier to manipulate them into following you, loving you or whatever you want them to do: Hermione used it to /remove herself from existence/ from her parents. Also, Obliviate is restricted by the Ministry to the Obliviation Squad as far as I understand it -- so while it isn't Dark Magic, it /is/ covered by the law.
