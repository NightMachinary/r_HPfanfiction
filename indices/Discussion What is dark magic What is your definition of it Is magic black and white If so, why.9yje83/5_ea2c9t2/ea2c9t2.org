Common fanon interpretation often describe opposing forces of 'dark' and 'light' magic, one based in negative intentions or emotions and one based in positive. I have a few problems with that. For one, 'light' magic simply does not exist in canon beyond /lumos/, no matter how well the Patronus charm seems to fit into fanon interpretations. Secondly, these distinctions between positive and negative emotions always seem rather hazy for the clear dichotomy fanon describes. Love may be a 'light' emotion, but what about lust? If lust is 'dark,' where is the boundary between them? What about justice and vengeance, another common 'light' and 'dark' pair?

Instead, I like to think of the term 'dark magic' as being used in two ways. It has a technical definition, used by scholars and traditionalists, referring to magic which is not fully understood or controlled, rooted in the same linguistic development that led to the term "the Dark Ages" (Latin /obscurus/). This includes old-style ritual magic like that used by Voldemort in his resurrection as well as the far more common emotion-based magic, such as the Cruciatus and Patronus spells. Secondly, however, it simply refers to 'bad' magic, much in the way that "Dark Wizards" is often taken to simply mean criminals in canon.

The best analog of this sort of terminology I can think of is the term 'drugs.' In common parlance, we all have a general sort of knowledge of what the term refers to, although some borderline cases exist in things like marijuana and alcohol. In many contexts, we would not interpret the term to mean medicine like ibuprofen, no matter that they fit the technical definition. Similarly, outside of a scholarly context, very few people will ever refer to the Patronus as dark magic.
