  The body bind, petrificus totalus - when exactly could that one be well intended?
#+end_quote

(a) medicine: safely immobilizing/restraining a patient

(b) stopping someone from self-harm (intended or accidental)

(c) stopping any kind of assault or violent action. Body bind seems to be the softest option, even better than stupefy.
