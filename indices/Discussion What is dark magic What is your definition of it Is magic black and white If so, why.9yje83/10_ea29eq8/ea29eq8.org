In my opinion Dark Magic is magic that needs strong emotions to cast. The Cruciatus requires you to feel joy at causing pain, you need to /love/ it, not just desire it, that's why when Harry cast it on Bellatrix after she killed Sirius it only caused her mild discomfort because he was fueled by a desire for revenge, that's why Voldemort said "You've got to mean it Harry."

Similarly the Avada Kedavra needs you to feel an intense, burning hatred for the target, and a strong desire to see them die, it's a powerful spell because it drains you emotionally, you can't just cast them like a machine gun which is where certain fics get it wrong, it's meant to be a spell that takes a lot out of you, which is why Voldemort was so terrifying because he could cast it almost effortlessly.

Contrary to popular belief, spells like the entrail expelling curse, or similar "horrific and brutal spells" aren't Dark in nature because they were created to be used by butchers in the preparation of animals for slaughter. Just because Dark Wizards use them on humans doesn't make the spells Dark, blame the shooter not the gun sort of mentality.
