So first of all there are two ideas tangled up together. So called Dark Witches and the like is mostly propaganda or an insult implying that the individual is evil, debased, or regularly uses dark magic. The other is the question of what is actually dark magic.

Dark Magic is magic that invariably causes harm, not like a how a fire spell can burn, but for example a dismembering spell that thwarts attempts to reattach or heal what has been severed. This harm is not necessarily to the target, but also the user. The unforgivables almost certainly damage the souls of the caster when used to Murder (not simply 'kill'), Torture (beyond mere 'pain'), and enslave or subjugate (rather than merely control).

Magic in seems to be inherently whimsical in HP and using it to cause harm might very well be some sort of sin.

Light magic is rarer and is wholly benevolent. A patronis would never herd dementors towards a victim and the spell would simply fail if the caster attempted to do so.

Most magic is neutral used to create effects rather than pursuing an outcome, again fire might burn but it isn't meant to burn someone which ties into why magical are so resistant to harm.
