In my own personal headcanon, I like thinking that there are multiple sources of magic, "white", "dark" and neutral. Where pulling from good or bad will twist the mebtality of the person using them.

Thus, both dark and white magic both end up manipulating their uses, to their own connected personality traits mental states.l, whereas neutral doesn't change their users at all.

This is a headcanon where, when all is said and done, humans are powerless to stop the influence magic has on them, and in the end, there is only power, and those too afraid to seek it.
