Actually, concerning the Cruciatus Curse. There is IMHO quite valid point in chapter 20 of linkffn(4236594). Cruciatus might originated as a medical spell. If you know something about the research of human pain, then there are situations that for some radical piece of surgery doctors so overwhelm patient's body with pain, it is insensitive to the specific pain caused by the surgery (patient being under anaesthesia or something).

The same goes for Imperius (and Obliviate). It could be theoretically valid method of mental healing for extreme situations, e.g. I have in my fanfiction small girl who has developed Obscurial. Memories of torture are so traumatic, she needs to have them medically removed (by something like Obliviate) so that she may develop enough personality to be able to deal with them afterwards, and to prevent possible suicide attempts. Kind of equivalent of extreme psychopharmaca used by the muggle psychiatrists in such situations.

And of course, Sectumsempra could probably be used for medical amputations.
