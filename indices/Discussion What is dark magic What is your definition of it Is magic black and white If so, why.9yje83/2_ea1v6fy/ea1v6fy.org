I agree with you - most spells that we see can be used to harm people. In fact, most jinxes are meant to cause harm to the person they are being cast at. However, I think Dark Magic refers to powerful magic with grave malicious intent.

Looking at the curses we know:

- Cruciatus Curse: As mentioned by OP, there is no good that can come out of it. The caster intends to torture the victim by this curse
- Imperious Curse: I don't see how being controlled by someone else can be good, regardless of the purpose. It is similar to the argument that can be made for Obliviate.
- Killing Curse: This is an unbeatable weapon - while putting people out of their medical misery might be a postive use, it would be a very small percentage of usage should this curse be allowed openly. I would argue that it would be better to use controlled poisons for that purpose instead. Additionally, just like crucio, I don't believe the killing curse would work for everyone because of the state of mind it would require for someone to /want/ to kill another human being willingly.
- Sectumsempra: Again, a torture/killing method where no positive intent can be assumed.
- Creation of Horcruxes: Requires killing multiple people to split one's soul into two

Dark Magic provides means of hurting others, usually irreparably. Hence the witch or wizard casting it must have the intent /and/ will to cast it properly. Imagine the state of mind of a person who is willing to cause such harm without the premise of a war.\\
In my head, I think of the jinxes and spells like stupefy as common criminals like robbery/aggravated assault while Dark Magic is comparable to a serial killer or violating Geneva Conventions.
