Stages of Hope by kayly silverstorm, linkffn(6892925)

Good emotional story, I liked the story when I read it few years ago. Few months ago, I read it again, couldn't like it anymore. This story has stuffs that I dislike - more specifically James bashing & nice Snape & a truly insufferable Hermione. Another thing to add, the story has nice Malfoy's & Sirius in Slytherin. Though it's not my preferred choice, I have no problem with Snape & Malfoy's being nice but when these come with a jerk James, I seriously dislike these two things together.
