Whatever universe is, I really really dislike the idea of having a story both jerk James & nice Snale-Malfoy's. I understand it's AU & you can write nice Snape-Malfoy's without making James jerk. As soon as James became jerk, it basically means confirmation of how Snape represented James over the seven books rather than looking any good virtue of James - it doesn't matter which universe it is.

(In this story) Harry's comments on AU James' son is basically Snape's word from canon universe how he viewed James/views Harry. James & his son' characterization in AU is based on canon Snape's word. And that's what I dislike it most.
