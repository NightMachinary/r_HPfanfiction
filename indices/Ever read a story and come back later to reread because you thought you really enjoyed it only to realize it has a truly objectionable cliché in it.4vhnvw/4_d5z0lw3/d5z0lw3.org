Faultlines by Pinky Brown- I LOVED this fic. Then a few months ago I decided to reread it and it just made my skin crawl.

One of my biggest pet peeves in HP fanfic is the idea that Ron is Hermione's lapdog and is a mess without her. This fic is just one big "Look how pathetic Ron is without Hermione." fap fest. I can't believe I once thought of this as a top ten fav.
