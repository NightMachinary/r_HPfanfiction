Nightmares of Future Past. It was probably the first fic I read and I went back and reread it recently and there's a lot of stuff in that are considered cliche in fanfic now; fitness regiments, Snape being super evil, magic super trunk, friendly goblins, slight pureblood aristocracy, magical cores. I know it was started before DH came out so at the time those things could have been novel. Saying that I still look forward to it being updated just because I want to know how it ends.
