Too many to list; I was, and remain, a huge H/HR shipper, and unfortunately, in the Golden Age of fanfiction, that came part and parcel with a whole lot of Ron, Ginny, and sometimes Dumbledore bashing. That used to be something I could handle, but the longer I've been a part of the fandom the less I can abide it. Nowadays, if the writer isn't adroit enough to handle the pairing without ruining the other characters, it's not worth my time.
