Sure, it might work, but you will run into several problems.

- The HP world is relatively small. There aren't that many characters, and like 90% of the cast eats in one of two locations every day (Hogwarts, the Ministry). Generally, more POVs imply a bigger world, otherwise it feels constricting. So you would have to do a lot of worldbuilding. Compare the HP world to the size of the cast and world of GoT.

- The world of Harry Potter isn't necessary made to be "gritty," although you certainly can make it that way. It's just a bit unnatural, just like making GoT very whimsy would be unnatural. Imagine the sorting hat in GoT, and that it isn't destroyed.

- Gritty is also not my personal stuff, and it tends to just make a story depressing. It's very much "handle with care."

- Multi-POV tends to slow things down. Allow stuff to happen off-screen (take for example GoT)

- And secondary storylines are hard to pull off, sew GoT again - a lot of people dislike the Daenaerys chapters.
