It's not so much monotony as it is speed and flow. What takes one POV three chapters to do will take two POVs six, especially so if they're undergoing separate adventures.

In a standard novel, you have on average eighty-thousand words starring the adventures of one protagonist with one POV. If you're having multiple POVs, you either write less on each POV (risking faster or jumpier pacing), or you have a far longer story with each individual POV's drama spaced out (risking your plot moving so slowly that there's moss growing on your characters in real time).

Imagine having to read three chapters of a different book starring a different character following a different plotline between each chapter of the canon Harry Potter books and you'll get the idea of the issue. With multiple POVs, you're basically writing multiple novels in one. It's a very difficult balance to strike, having multiple separate 'main plots' going on at once and making sure they get their fair 'screen time'. So you've got to be careful that you keep each individual plot thread (ie. POV's plot thread) moving and don't let them lag and don't give any particular one too much priority either.
