I've seen it work in written fiction where the timeline moves forward on the vast majority of chapters (or scenes), perhaps with one or two that occupy the the same space. Of course, it does require the different characters having goals that relate to one another in some way so that the reader can fill in the gaps. Also, careful editing to make sure that the chapters aren't bloated.

If it's done by scene, then I think the changes need to be infrequent enough that the reader isn't jolted around by perspective. Perhaps with a main character or max two who have the lion's share of the plot and another couple of appear infrequently.

It very rarely works in fanfic because you have to be particularly skilled to pull it off, in my opinion. It goes for fics in general, I suppose.
