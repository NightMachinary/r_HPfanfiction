Exactly. It can work, and has done in the past, but it's really, really hard to pull off well.

But yes, it's definitely a good approach to take the multiple POVs as separate pieces of the puzzle rather than two different windows to the same plot or two different pictures entirely. But even that's really difficult to manage - and doubly so in fanfiction, where people will often ask questions you answered in the ANs or berate you for bashing/washing a character they have a different perception of.

I think one of the best examples I saw of this in fanfiction was that one with the Obliviated Police Officer who kept rediscovering the magical world because she left notes and recordings and magicals are ignorant idiots who've never heard of a tape recorder. She had her time when her plot-arcs came up, but it was nicely balanced with the main parts of Harry and everyone else. (Can't remember the name of the fic, though).
