Thanks for the insight. I was thinking of starting the very first chapter with a bang. A sudden event that thrusts the various characters out of their normal comfort zones (quite literally) and forces them along uncommon paths. The intent would be to break up the monotony early and, given the unusual circumstances they'd find themselves in, avoid the laziness and pacing issues about which you speak.

Also, incidentally, I am toying with the idea if this being a post-Voldemort fic. Because honestly, Voldemort has been done to death and I'd like to see something different than blood supremacy as a threat.
