Depends on how you'd pace it. I've seen a few do that kind of POV-switch, but most of them have turned out incredibly slow paced where the plot moves slower than continental plates.

On a personal note, I'd also say that you'd need to work out how to make the POV character's voices distinct and recognisable. One thing I've seen multi-POV fics do is label the chapters with the relevant POV and it's always come off a bit... lazy. But that's purely a personal preference/observation.
