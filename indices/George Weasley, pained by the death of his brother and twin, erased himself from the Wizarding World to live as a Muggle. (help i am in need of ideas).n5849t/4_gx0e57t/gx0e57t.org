I'm currently writing a one short because of this post. It's similar to this and I'll give you a snippet of the start:

/It was the year 2048 and George Prewett sat in the faded grey recliner at Stoneycroft Aged Care Centre. After the death of his twin brother Fred he moved to Stoneycroft, Liverpool to get away from the Wizarding World. The Wizarding World caused him too much pain. Fred, Harry, Ron, Bill and Fred. Hermione and Ginny. He had been with Fred until he was 19, since they were born to when Fred died in 1997. 19 is too young to die./

/Although he was 70 years old now, he could still pull a prank, trick or joke on anyone, just like his glory days with Fred, Lee and the marauders map. George brushed those thoughts away because there was no need to remember them anymore. To everyone at Stoneycroft he just went to the local public school and his parents were Albus and Minerva Prewett./

/The matron on shift, Hannah, walked around tending to all of the seniors needs. The smell of burnt coffee drifted away from the kitchen and filled the room. Through the window the snow fluttered gently down and icicles grew from the roof. It was almost Christmas time, the time George hated most. He missed his real family but knew it was pointless to try and escape./

/Tinsel decorated the room and a 2 meter tall pine tree stood tall. The tree was next to the blazing fireplace, nothing in comparison to the one in the Gryffindor common room. The whole room was nothing in comparison. George stood up, to walk back to his room, where he could think about these things alone./

In a few days when I'm done and have posted it, I'll link it here.
