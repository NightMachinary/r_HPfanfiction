Plot twist: That woman was actually Umbridge having fled and George Weasley was actually on an undercover mission to find Umbridge and assassinate her as revenge for what she did in the (indirect) service of Mr. Noseless. What she doesn't know is that George sprayed magical contact poison on her groceries that would kill her and only her and leave no trace at all. Mission accomplished.
