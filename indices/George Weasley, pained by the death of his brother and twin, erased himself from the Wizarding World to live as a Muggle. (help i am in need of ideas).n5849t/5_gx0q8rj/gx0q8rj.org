In my mind I picture that George erased himself from the memory of his friends and family before leaving into the muggle world.(This would be a great magical feat enforcing that he is anything but ordinary). Maybe even erased his own (could go either way). When Percy unattentionly runs into him he doesn't recognize him but it jars his memory. Now he's having flashes of the past and a brother he doesn't have.

For him not to recognize Fred's twin you'd either have to make this an AU where they aren't identical twins or make it to where George has altered his appearance perhaps he can't stand seeing Fred reflection in the mirror because for just a second he thinks it him before realizing it's just his own reflection.

Could be told from either or both pov, but of from Percy's I'm picturing a mystery vibe with some feels. Sort of like running on air but with out the romance.

If from George's it would depend on if he remembers who he is. He could think he was going crazy. Remembering things that didn't happen. He could even start saying strange things out of habit, and of course add Percy following him around using magic to hide it could be entertaining.
