I actually love the idea of George erasing himself from the memories of his family and friends and I agree it's the only way this prompt works, but he would also probably have to do something a bit more widespread since he was the co-owner of WWW and presumably somewhat well recognised.

I think it could probably tie into “canon” as well - we know that Ron eventually goes on to work as a partner at WWW, and I like the idea of a Percy redemption arc, so maybe it could be something like Percy accidentally runs into George somewhere, starts having flashbacks of Fred, thinks he's going crazy, runs into Angelina and ropes her into helping, then they talk to Hermione because she's the expert in memory spells amongst them, and then Ron gets involved. And they somehow find a way to bring George back.
