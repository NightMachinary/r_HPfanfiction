I don't think it is a very good idea to mix Magic with Science, since Science is logic while Magic is not. Since the magic of HP is conceptual, it is possible (dare I say, probable?) that a spell designed to "split" an atom would do that, without any other reaction (like water would turn into oxygen and hydrogen, but no explosion). To have an explosion, a wizard need to create a spell that make things explode.

But hey, it's fanfictions and "Mc applied science to magic and easily dealt with the problem" can make a nice crack fic (or a muggle wanking one but that's another story).
