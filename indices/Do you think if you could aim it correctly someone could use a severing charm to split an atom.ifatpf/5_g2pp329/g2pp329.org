Atoms are a lot smaller than you think they are. They're mostly empty space. That being said, if you /could/, it wouldn't do much. Nuclear blasts are powerful, yes, but we're talking a lot more than an atom being split in those cases.

I do remember one fic where the philosopher's gold was radioactive due to the whole "lead to gold" thing spitting off odd isotopes and such. Everyone thought it was cursed, but since wizards are resilient beyond belief all the damage was short-term or healable. I think harry and Hermione actually figured it out at some point.
