Mine also. Albus /never/ says who killed Ariana even though he's had use of the Hogwarts Headmaster's Penseive for decades. He doesn't say he doesn't know, he just says she was killed. Albus' statements are evasive and uncommitted, a tell that he knows something he doesn't want to reveal even by accident. His rambling while drinking the poison in the sea-cave reveals a considerable freight of guilt, too. Aberforth may /say/ he doesn't know who killed her, but his reaction to his elder brother - blames him, punches him in the face at Ariana's funeral - is quite speaking, no?

And, really, who's more likely to have been careless in her general direction? The madman who saw her as a resource for his plan of world domination, her favourite brother, or the brother who saw her as the reason he was trapped in Godric's Hollow?
