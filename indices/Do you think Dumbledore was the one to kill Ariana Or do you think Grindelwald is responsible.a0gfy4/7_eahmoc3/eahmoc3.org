In my headcanon it was Dumbledore. Gellert had a thing with Arianna and just played Dumbledore to have a powerful ally. Dumbledore realised that his feelings were not returned, the fight escalated and in the end Gellert fled, cursing Dumbledore and the entirety of Britain for siding with Dumbledore's version of the events.

Makes for a better story than good vs evil.
