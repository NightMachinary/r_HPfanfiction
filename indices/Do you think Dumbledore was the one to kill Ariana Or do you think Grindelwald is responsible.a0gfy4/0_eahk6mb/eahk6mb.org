I don't think it matters. To reach the point in an argument with people you like/love where you have spells strong enough to cause death flying around, you'd have to have lost control completely.

It wasn't just Grindelwald who lost control, and Dumbledore was just as 'dark'/evil/enamored with utilitarianism at that point. Any of them could have done it, and my moneys on multiple people hitting Ariana. If she was in the middle of the fight she'd likely have been hit by multiple sides.

When Dumbledore says its his fault, I think it means he himself lost control.
