I always figured that Dumbledore didn't KNOW if it was his spell that ultimately killed Ariana or not... it plagued him that he didn't know, but ultimately he still viewed the entire thing WAS his fault... No matter if the actual kill came from his wand or not, he was still responsible for the situation having come to that in the first place.
