Disciplining using magic sounds a lot like spanking; some parents do it, others think it's abuse. So, here's a quick brainstorm I had with myself that includes magical punishments that don't necessarily use magic directly on the kids:

- Cleaning the family owl's cage

- Shooing away harmless, magical pests (like the Weasley's gnomes)

- If their kid is caught making fun of someone else's appearance, spell their mirrors to make the kid see themselves with that "bad" trait to give them a lesson in empathy and humility.

- If the child says a cuss word, spell them so that every time they say it their mouth tastes like boogers for X amount of time.

- Take their broom away / no flying lessons with parents until they behave

- Magically "stick" a kid to a chair while in time out.

- Kid forgetting his curfew? Spell their shoes to automatically start moving them towards home.
