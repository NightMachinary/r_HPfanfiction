My headcanon is that Walburga used the torture curse on Sirius right before he ran away because he had finally realized that he could stand up to her and she couldn't intimidate him into obeying her anymore.

Other parents, I think, might have used a silencing charm in combination with something else, like standing in the corner. Maybe a stinging hex on the bum for more corporal punishment.

There's probably as great a variety of disciplinary choices among magical parents as there are among muggle parents. Some parents might be horrified of using magic as punishment while others think it is perfectly normal.
