  I'd love to read your stuff. How do I find you?

Umm, well, the thing is... I haven't actually posted any of it (yet). A long time ago I wrote Twilight and Walking Dead fanfiction and I never finished anything beyond a one-shot despite being really interested in them at the time. So I made a promise to myself to write/finish/edit before I'd ever post fic again, just because I know how frustrating it is to find abandoned fics. So I have several WIPs (one's over 350k), but nothing officially posted. It's the middle that always bogs me down, even though I have everything plotted out!

Didn't mean to write a novel at you, lol. Sorry.
