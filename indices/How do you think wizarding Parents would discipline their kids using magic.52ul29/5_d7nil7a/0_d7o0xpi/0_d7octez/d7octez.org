Maybe. I don't remember any particular fics that bring it up, but it's possible I was influenced by one or more that have it.

I think it might have been something along the lines of Sirius pushing her buttons too far and too often and her temper broke and she cast it in anger. I don't think it lasted very long nor that she cackled gleefully afterwards. Perhaps she realized what she'd done, was horrified by it, and ran to another room to calm down. Or Orion might have stepped in. There's plenty of parents that are flawed that do something horrible as discipline that they regret immediately but don't know how to fix the situation afterwards.

I think Sirius got his temper and anger issues from his mother and the examples she set in his childhood. He pushed too far and broke the camel's back for her with his rebellion. She pushed too far and broke the camel's back for him with her treatment of him.

Then again, I am a fic author, so it's possible that it's just my headcanon for my characterizations of Sirius and Walburga.

On a side note, I don't think the Ministry can detect when an Unforgivable is cast. They can trace underage magic to locations that shouldn't have magic--such as the homes of a muggle-born or muggle raised students, but it's up to parents in magical households to police their children about performing underage magic. If the Ministry can't detect what regular magic is cast or by whom even with the trace, how would they know who cast an Imperio or Cruciatus except for someone of authority seeing it, seeing the results of it, or someone else reporting it?

I have a distinct memory from my childhood of my mother with her hands around my sister's throat, pressing her against a wall. My dad was the one to step in and tell Mom to back off and calm down. Mom was horrified when she did calm down and realize what she'd done. My sister was fine--angry and probably frightened (she was probably 15 or so at the time)--but ultimately fine.
