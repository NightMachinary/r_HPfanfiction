To be fair, though, the way her portrait is I could see her using a hot iron on a child as a means of punishment, and I think what it boils down to is not people forgetting what the Cruciatus curse is but rather what portraits are.

Because wizarding portraits are an oft-exaggerated impression of a person, with ability to gather information but with no ability to truly learn from it. What that means is that the portrait was even less sane than Walburga was at her craziest. For example, people see her portrait hate Sirius and spew venom at him but had it been the real Walburga she no doubt would have not done so upon learning that Sirius got thrown into Azkaban for being a follower of Tom (even if it was only a misconception) and then escaped from it; even if she were to hate him again later, should this happen, were she not a portrait she probably would have spent some time feeling proud for him “finally seeing the light” or other such inanity; but, as a portrait, she'd hated him and therefore /it/ will hate him until the end of time, even were it to learn of something that should have made it feel differently.
