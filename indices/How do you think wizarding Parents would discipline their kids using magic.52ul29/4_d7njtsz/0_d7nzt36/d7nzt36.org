We frequently see Walburga using the cruciatus on Sirius as the reason for his flight in fanfiction, but it has no support in canon as far as I know.

It may be a weakness of canon (not exploring more the society built upon magic), but fanfiction authors seems a little too fond, in my mind, of a curse /which you can be condemned to hell for life for a single use/. Using it is not on the level with beating a child with a belt (which is physical abuse), it is on the level of branding the child with hot iron. Maybe Harry's (mostly failed attempt) use of it, or his ability to rebound after being under it, distorts our views a readers.

What we see of Walburga Black is her madness at the end of her life, and the opinion of a child she was abusive with; well, she was probably not a nice woman (understatment, I know). But there is still a gap from being a physically and/or mentally abusive parent and torture on that scale.
