"Crucio!" (well, at least for the Blacks. Could see that happen with a mother like Walburga Black...)

As for a serious answer, I never was disciplined with more than a "I'm disappointed" - talk as a kid by my parents -my parents and I were quite easy-going. A scourgify for a foul word, or a talk, if you have done something wrong. I don't think violence is a solution for such things.
