I remember reading Denial when it was first posted, and again a few years ago. That is a good one. I need to read more Oracle Obscured. Have you ever read Lily Potter's Biggest Secret? It's kinda cliched, but I honestly loved it. Hermione finds out that Snape is her biological father, and Harry is her half-brother. It's a Dramione fic, which I'm not usually a fan of, but it was well written. The romance and family bits are pretty fluffy, but it was a nice read after I had just finished reading some long, angsty fics.
