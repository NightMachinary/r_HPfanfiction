'as green as .. ' didn't link properly, it's a collection of ficlets but is definitely worth reading, if only for the first entry, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6219193/chapters/14248570]['Seventh-Year will put Your Name in GOF for a Sickle']] and sequel [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6219193/chapters/15018232][The Goblet of Fire Is A Disaster]]

  You wanna enter... McGonagall? No, no, nonononono. That's how people effing die, man. Like, she would destroy the competition and it would be glorious to behold and I would cry tears of awe at the sheer beauty of her wrath... but also, I am too young and beautiful to die. She would find us and we would die. Best scenario is she keeps us as pet mice forever.
