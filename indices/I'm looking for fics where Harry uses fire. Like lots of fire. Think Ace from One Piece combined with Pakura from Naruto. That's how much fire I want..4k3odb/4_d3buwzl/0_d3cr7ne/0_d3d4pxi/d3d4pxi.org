I would love to! Keep in mind it's a way-in-the-future sort of thing. It's going to have its fair share of tropes. It's also going to be a serious min-max of a power.

Starts with the fact that elementals exist, though /extremely/, like, once in half a millennium rare. Potters are descended from a Wind elemental, though that only plays a very small role, and the Evans are from a Fire elemental. Voldemort kills Harry, severs his sole from his body, and just when it's about to pass on, that sliver of a fire elemental's soul -which /cannot/ be killed by an AK due to being a force of nature- hooks onto Harry's soul and... converts it, I guess, carving the Sowilo lightning bolt rune (rune of the sun) into his forehead. During this process, house goes boom, Voldemort gets vaporized and a part of his soul latches on to the rune.

There will be the shitty!Petunia trope; Vernon tries to mitigate the damage but he can only do so much. Harry does not take this lying down, because fire is not meek or timid. Eventually it culminates in Harry burning the house down with the entire family (plus Marge) inside it using gasoline and a match. Dudley survives, is severely traumatized. Harry survives because fire can't harm him and goes to a correctional facility, meets someone who actually acts as a mother figure to him, but she dies of a heart attack for plot reasons.

*Hogwarts, year one.* Harry goes into slytherin for plot reasons, and also because he's kind of a sociopath, because both his Elemental soul and the Horcrux, represented mentally as snakes made of fire, egg him on all the damn time. Then they find out he can't do a single damn bit of magic. At all. Harry also has ZERO magic resistance like all muggles, which means that spell are basically two to three times longer lasting. So they tell him to study theory. Halloween roles around and Harry gets rather irritated because this smart -or at least Not Dumb- girl named Hermione is crying in the bathroom because of a mean remark. So he finds her in the bathroom and basically tells her to toughen the fuck up because words mean practically nothing, with some minor success. Trolls walks in, Harry finally manages an incendio. Staff walks in to find an absolutely wrecked bathroom, a charred troll corpse, and Harry laughing his ass off in delight. Skip forward. Quirrel basically dies of the same thing.

*Year two.* Harry's getting a handle on his flame spell and trying out a new fire spell or two, like bluebell flames or something. He literally can't do anything else. Chamber opens, some Slytherin upper years think it's funny to summon a snake and dangle it over the younger years' heads. Harry immediately snatches it up and starts cooing and hissing at it because they had a communal pet snake at the correctional facility and snakes have a rather dry wit when they're not thinking about food or sun. Slytherin house quietly loses its shit. Skip forward. Down in the chamber because reasons. Some other gryffindor is down there with him and pulls the Sword out of the Hat but drops it, Harry picks it up but it actually /burns/ him because Gryffindor is House-ist. Shove it through the brain, snake fang in the arm. Harry flops over on top of the diary. Tears don't work fast enough. Fawkes can feel Harry's Elemental soul and says "fuck this shit" and goes into an early Burning Day on top of him, basically taking Harry along for the ride. This kills both horcruxes, the book and the scar.

*Year three.* More progress on flame spells, new and old. Haven't decided what I'm doing with Sirius yet. Most notable thing is Harry getting tired of Malfoy's shit and beating him the fuck up in a dark corridor. Draco ends up in the hospital with multiple broken bones and nightmares.

*Year four.* Entered into the Tournament, first task roles around, Harry faces a Latvian Lavabelly. Harry tries to talk to the dragon, it doesn't like him. Then he tries to distract it with fancy ghost fire and slip past it. Dragons know fire, doesn't work. Dragon turns and covers Harry in viscous fire (hence the Lavabelly). Harry's Elemental soul wakes up enough to go "Bitch, Please" and summon a firestorm hot enough to cook the dragon inside its scales. After the task, Fleur's mother walks into the tent and says "well fuck me sideways you're a fire elemental." Second task is a complete bomb, because cold, deep water is a Fire Elemental's natural enemy. He can breath underwater because of his Wind inheritance, but can't do shit otherwise. Still thinking on the third task.

Graveyard scene happens as usual sans Cedric, but for the duel Voldemort says "Oh, fire elemental, huh? Fancy Schmancy! Fire elemental /this!/" and covers Harry in Fiendfyre. This wakes his Elemental soul up entirely and it goes "Well fuck you too" and summons a teeny tiny ball of fire which then explodes into a kilometer wide firestorm, killing all the death eaters not fast enough to disapparate (there were a couple) and disintegrating Voldemort for a second time.

That's as much as I've got.
