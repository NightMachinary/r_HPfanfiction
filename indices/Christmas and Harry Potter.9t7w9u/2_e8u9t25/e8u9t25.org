Harry has a godfather, Lily and James were buried in a church graveyard, Easter and Christmas holidays are celebrated.

The wizarding world clearly has some sort of Christianity. But the UK is different to the USA.. the religious roots of these kinds of holidays are barely acknowledged. It's more of a cultural holiday than a religious one.
