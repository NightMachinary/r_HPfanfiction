  Also Jean de Arc was before 1450 and she was burned as a witch.

Heretic and cross-dresser, not a witch - and they didn't manage to prove the heresy charges (for all she was illiterate she could apparently bandy theology with the best of them), but executed her anyway after giving her a choice of cross-dressing or public nudity.

And that was a kangaroo court into the bargain: the english were basically setting up the execution of a prisoner of war so as to cause maximum embarrassment to their enemies. It was the Inquisition that called them out on it, declaring Joan a martyr and the judge a heretic.

(The myth that she was tried for witchcraft comes from the fact that she was burned at the stake, and Everyone Knows they burned witches. They didn't: burning was the penalty for heresy, not witchcraft, in Joan's time. They didn't even /start/ conflating magic with diabolism and heresy until much later.)

As for your miracles point, it's completely irrelevant. The only miracle that's actually relevant to christian doctrine - regardless of sect, it's in the Nicene Creed - is the resurrection. And /that/ is the one that magic can't do at all. Blasphemous mockeries, like inferi and horcruxes, but not the real deal.
