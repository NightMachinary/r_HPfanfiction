I'm not gonna enter all this debate, I'm just gonna say that Catholic Christmas is not the original Christmas, and as such magicals would hold the original meaning of the winter solstice and care not about some muggles using the day for the birthday of what was obviously some muggleborn.

In fact I can see all magical raised laughing at Christianity, seeing it as nothing but a joke started by some no name wizard. Poor deluded muggles!
