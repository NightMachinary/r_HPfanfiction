The first execution of a witch was in the late 14th century, before that it was considered folklore. Also Jean de Arc was before 1450 and she was burned as a witch.

And obviously they were never dangerous towards anyone with a wand, but the mere fact that they did not stamp down on witch hunts would be reason enough to take offence. I mean, if someone started executing Frenchmen for being British, that won't go over well in the UK despite the fact that no Subject of the Queen dies. Lastly, which is my main point, Christian beliefs have no appeal to people who go through Hogwarts. Water to wine? Probably part of the transfiguration OWL. Heal the sick? Pomfrey isn't God's daughter either? Raise the dead? DADA sixth year. Burning Bush? Flitwick can do that.
