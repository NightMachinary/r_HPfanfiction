That, I have to point out, is 'everyone knows' history and complete balls.

The first thing you're getting wrong is the dates: the witch panics don't start until 1450 or thereabouts: there isn't any serious preaching against even peasant superstitions until the 1430s.

The next thing you're getting wrong is in treating late medieval and early modern christianity as monolithic, when it massively, gigantically, fighting-actual-major-wars-over-it /wasn't/. Unreformed Roman Catholic christianity came to witch-hunting much, much later than their Protestant counterparts, and with nothing like the same enthusiasm. The Inquisition could and did defrock priests for witch-hunting - the author of the /Malleus Maleficarum/ being the most famous example from the late 15th century - and regarded most accusations of sorcery as fraudulent and not worth their time. They only proceeded against such sorcerers as they /did/ investigate if there was an accusation of heresy or devil-worship into the bargain.

Which leads to the next error: that the organised, religious persecutions were of witches. They weren't. The clergy were after heretics and devil-worshippers, not sorcerors, and it wasn't until the late 15th century and the /Malleus Maleficarum/ that you start to see the practise of magic equated with heresy and devil-worship. The Catholic church thought that that was bollocks and defrocked the author, the protestant churches took the idea - and the book - and ran with it, especially in Scotland, where King James VI was a huge fan of the /Malleus Maleficarum/ (and a complete lunatic who shouldn't have been in charge of a whelk stall, never mind a nation). It's why they started burning witches, since burning was the punishment for heresy. Heresy, in protestant areas, included "still being catholic," which could and did get you also accused of devil-worship, since Pope=Antichrist was a popular meme at the time.

The final point is the killer, though: the idea that witch-hunting was official and constant. It wasn't: it was nearly all kangaroo courts, lynchmobs, and during wartime. The Salem and Pendle cases stand out precisely because they were peacetime affairs with properly constituted trials (and in the case of the Pendle trials, only went ahead with /massive/ procedural irregularities, the prosecution's chief witness being nine years old, and this /was/ very much criticised at the time). Much of the witch-hunting in England - nearly a third of the killings from 1450-1750 were done in the space of three years - was done by one man, who had no official sanction and charged swingeing fees for his services, and got away with it because there was a civil war going on at the time. And the actual official authorities - apart from the few who were lending colour of law to the improperly-constituted Manningtree trial - publicly condemned him as a fraud.

Bluntly, so long as you were publicly orthodox, stayed within areas controlled by the Catholic Church or the Church of England (which never strayed a long way from its Catholic roots) and war didn't break out, you could be a witch and a christian without suffering in the least for it. Over the period we're talking about, Germany would have been the riskiest place to be magical, since the local 'default religion' could change overnight with a change of ruler and the longest and worst wars were fought there. France and England would have been dangerous only during their civil wars (in the case of England, only for three years in two counties, and France was the first nation in Europe to outlaw witch-trials altogether, in the 1680s). Italy and Spain, it was /way/ more dangerous to be Jewish in those parts than to be magical
