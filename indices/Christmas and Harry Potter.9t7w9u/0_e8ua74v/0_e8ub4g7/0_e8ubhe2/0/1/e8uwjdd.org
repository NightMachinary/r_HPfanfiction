600 years ago. Enough time to forget.

Also, Christianity does have the whole "turn the other cheek" thing.

/(...) But I say to you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. To one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also (...)/

It's not crazy to think that some C. of E. practitioners wouldn't quite mind the witch hunts and would still be Christians.
