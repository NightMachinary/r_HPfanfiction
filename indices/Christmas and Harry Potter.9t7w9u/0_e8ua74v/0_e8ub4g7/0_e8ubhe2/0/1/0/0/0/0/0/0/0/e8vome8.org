But the difference is that Spain conquered these areas and there was no way a muggle nation could subjugate wizards since the Imperious curse (or similar spells), instantaneous translocation and offensive magic exist.

Also, the Holy Sea had way more power over Europe than it had over the Spanish Main. The pope, at some point, banned slavery and yet no one there cared.
