Ok, I can't exactly talk about the C. of E. since I was raised Catholic, though I'm no longer a part of it, but it feels to me as if you're missing a few important things about christian doctrine.

The acts of the Apostles are letters written to the other nascent christian communities, and while they are in the New Testament, they aren't exactly related to Jesus himself.

Luke 10:25-28

  25 And one day an authority on the law stood up to put Jesus to the test. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to receive eternal life?"

  26 What is written in the Law?" Jesus replied. "How do you understand it?" 27 He answered, " ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Love him with all your strength and with all your mind.' And, ‘Love your neighbor as you love yourself.' " 28 "You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do that, and you will live.".

That's it. That's all you need to know/practice. Everything else. /Everything else/, is historical context.

The bible is *not* to be taken literally. Doing so, is missing the whole point of it.

*Back to the original topic*, while there's probably a part of Wizardkind that wouldn't be too happy about christianity, saying that /all/ of them would be against it is ignoring human nature itself.

Remember what the Catholic church did in South America. They conquered most of it, and yet, South America has the highest amount of Catholics in the world.

You'd think that they would reject it, or that they would cling to their ancestral rites, and the truth is that there is a lot of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqetCK3ra2U][Ancestral faith mixed up with Catholic faith.]] (They are supposed to be demons surrendering themselves to God)
