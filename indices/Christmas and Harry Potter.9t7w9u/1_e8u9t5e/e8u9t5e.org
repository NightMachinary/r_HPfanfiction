No reason for them not to be christian, the witch-persecutions weren't anywhere near universal among european christianity. They peaked during wartime, and were always skewed /heavily/ to protestant communities. The Roman and Celtic churches both had extensive folklore of bishops and saints performing feats of magic and the Inquisition came to witch-hunting centuries later than their protestant counterparts - the author of /Malleus Maleficarum/ actually got kicked out of the catholic church for witch-hunting. So it's entirely plausible that a large proportion of magicals are catholic or, in England, C of E and Christmas comes with that.
