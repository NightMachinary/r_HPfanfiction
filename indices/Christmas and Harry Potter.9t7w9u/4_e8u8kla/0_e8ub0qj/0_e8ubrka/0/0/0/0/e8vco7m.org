  Christmas is also considered a very romantic holiday, and lovers are supposed to spend the evening together doing suitably romantic things. It is seen as really crucial for single women in Japan to have someone to spend Christmas Eve with; it is also really important where they spend Christmas Eve and what present they receive. The whole evening must be very special, gorgeous and romantic.

  Japanese women who have a boyfriend tend to show off, so women who don't are not happy to talk about the topic. In this respect, Christmas Eve in Japan is very much like Valentine's Day in the west (right down to the miserable singles who don't want to celebrate). Perhaps for this reason, staple Christmas songs in Japan include "Christmas Eve" by Tatsur≈ç Yamashita and "Last Christmas" by WHAM!, which both speak to heartbreak and loneliness on Christmas.
