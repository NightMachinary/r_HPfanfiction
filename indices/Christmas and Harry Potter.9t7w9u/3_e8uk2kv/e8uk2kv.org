We don't see any reason canonically to think that there's a religious component to the Wizarding World's observation of Christmas. Mostly it just lines up with the Winter Holiday from school, and is an excuse to exchange gifts and hang out with family and friends. Now, how that tradition would have entered the Wizarding World's cultural consciousness is certainly up for debate. All I know is in real life, I know many non-Christians that observe Christmas just because it's a cultural phenomenon. They have no religious component to it.
