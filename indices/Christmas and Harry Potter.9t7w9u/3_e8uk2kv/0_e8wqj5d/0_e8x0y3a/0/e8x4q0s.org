True, but regarding the OPs question the answer is a simple NO, so all we can do is come up with the more believable explanations and mine is that magical were the original pagans that invented those festivities. It is simply the most fitting answer even if by now we can see they don't do anything magical on those days.

Regarding plants and ingredients, I thought there was something about Polyjuice or Wolfsbane too but after checking it seems like it's fanon. /sigh/ So much potential wasted...
