So, this is a good explanation, but I'm not sure where it's supported in canon. It's certainly a very popular idea in fanon, but as far as canonical writing goes, we see that they observe Halloween, which also has ties to pagan tradition. We see no evidence whatsoever that the solstices or the equinoxes are at all important. We know that for potion making the phases of the moon play a part in the collection of ingredients (although that too may be a fanon idea).
