Christmas predates Christianity. It is not a christian tradition even if they adopted it and made up their own meaning. For story purposes it can be said that it was a magical tradition before it became muggle and it would easily fit real history. Also Christmas day was chosen or used to be on the winter solstice, which would have much more meaning to a magical than a muggle.
