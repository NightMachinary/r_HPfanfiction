linkffn(12893852) has quite a few casual uses of Divination. Tea leaf reading is seen a few of times (and implied to be done daily) and a prophecy is given by a Seer. Not Trelawney-level prophecy, just dropping a riddle onto someone. Also has some soul-sensing but I think that's MoD-stuff instead of Divination-stuff.
