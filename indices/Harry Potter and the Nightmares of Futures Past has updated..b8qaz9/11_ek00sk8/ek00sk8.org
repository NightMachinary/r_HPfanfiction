So, why would Snape take such an interest in Draco Malfoy? Is he simply being paid by Lucius? If so, why didn't something like that ever happen in the first timeline? I don't think that Karkaroff was any moral paragon who would have flatly refused such an offer. If that's not it, then what's motivating Snape?

Of course, in the first timeline people entered their own names in the Goblet, which would make it harder to choose Draco over Viktor. But that raises questions of its own about how and why that change came about.

Meanwhile, I can't think of many goals that the agent could have "almost succeeded in achieving" except to kill Harry Potter.
