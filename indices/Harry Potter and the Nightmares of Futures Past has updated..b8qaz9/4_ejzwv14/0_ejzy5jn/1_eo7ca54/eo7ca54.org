The very first fanfic I ever read was Sailor Ranko by Fire. After that, Burgerbecky had picked up the tale, and despite the wooden narration, I'd praise all the gods willing to listen if Thrice in a Millennium were to update tomorrow. I need to know what was up with Ukyo imitating the Senshi as she was.

(Obviously it's because she's gained some form of magic muscle memory from them when they healed her, but come on, there was no reason to blue ball us that far into the story...)
