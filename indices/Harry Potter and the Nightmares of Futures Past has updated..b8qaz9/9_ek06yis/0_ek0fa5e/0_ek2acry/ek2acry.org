For me, what really sells it is the characters and their relationships. We get to see Ginny, for example, as a main character from day 1, and Neville come into his own much sooner. Since Harry is trying to keep a low profile, he isn't gallivanting around the countryside incinerating Horcruxes in Fiendfyre; instead, he's taking time for his friends, building up their confidence and their skills. He's assuming that one way or another, there will be a war, and he wants the people he cares about to survive this time.
