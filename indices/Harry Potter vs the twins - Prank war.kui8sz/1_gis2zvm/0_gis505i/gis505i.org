Hmm, maybe I did over-do it a bit, but I've seen a lot of people talking about how in general there is a massive predejuice against both houses from each side of the spectrum.

But also, imagine you're eleven and you get sorted into Slytherin. Everyone else got a thunderous applause, but you get hisses and anger from everyone and the Slytherin house looks on in indifference because that's normal for them, but that's not how the kid sees it. They see that they're the center of attention and suddenly everyone starts hating on them because of what a stupid dusty old hat said.

They'd be angry at the house they were put into for not supporting them like all the other houses do for their own, for making a terrible reputation with the other houses and they'd hate themselves for being sorted there, where all the ‘evil' people are.

It drives a wedge between the students and their house, and it drives a wedge between the rest of the school. The kid would think themselves on their own because their head of house was ‘evil' and they wouldn't trust the other teachers because they never told them to stop booing or to be kind to them.

Or maybe they'd be more perceptive and realize that the students were just feeling past-on prejudice and that Slytherins were not evil, they were just perceived to be. But then, they still wouldn't trust the other teachers or the headmaster who never stepped in.

Wow, this was a prank prompt. How did I manage to start a debate about Houses and prejudice?
