I appreciate and respect the people doing the recommending, it's just that everything has been recommended countless times now. There's nothing wrong with that though. Before starting a new post wouldn't it be better if you used the search function and found similar posts, and skimmed through those. Because if someone makes a repeat post, I honestly assume that he has already been through other posts on the subreddit and if he has then he probably isn't looking for what has already been recommended countless times. Of course, I could be wrong but just my two cents.

Anyways, here's my recommendation:

I don't see it recommended often.
