The problem is that sometimes people want some oddly specific stuff while at other times the only parameters are the pairing. And simply searching ffn is not always an option because of poor tag use. I have seen a lot of stories which are tagged with two characters and turn out to be multi/harem. Or don't have any important characters besides the pairing tagged.

And of course there are new fics written all the time so two year old threads are not that great. Maybe we should have a monthly updated sticked post with a best of and another one with suggestions for stories to be added. I know there's the wiki but it is not up to date.
