Most of my favorite of H/D already recommended here. Here's some other:

Linkffn(Days to Come by chris400ad) - adult Harry & Daphne. Recently completed. Probably one of the finer story of this pair.

Linkffn(White Nights by PotterforPresident1997) - canon-ish, short story. For me, it's one of top 5 of this pair. I adore this one & The Trail by reviewgirl911.

Linkffn(Uncle Harry by R-dude) - one shot. Married Harry & Daphne visiting Dudley's.

Linkffn(A Game of Style and Brutality by BarneyXII) - it's summery sums it up.

Linkffn(Ruthless Revenge by Yunaine) - oneshot, crack fic.

Linkffn(Far from Perfect by fantasyra) - interesting premises. Even if Harry defeated Voldemort, he's exiled from wizarding world. He's actually suicidal.
