Ice Princess is one of my favorite HP/Daphne pairings. It's short at 15k words, and well worth a read. Not a typical Daphne Greengrass.

The Amalgamation Agreement is also a good one. Post Hogwarts, and also not a typical DG.

For a more typical "Ice Queen" DG, I like Contractual Invalidation a lot, also a post-Hogwarts story.
