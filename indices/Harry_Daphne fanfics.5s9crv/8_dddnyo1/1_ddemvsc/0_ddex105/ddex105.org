No, it's not trust me I had the exact same reaction looking at the summary but after the first chapter it really starts getting great. I dearly wish it wasn't abandoned because the way they characterize his anger is spot on and Dumbledore seems well characterised even if a bit different from canon. Also actually goblins are kind of normal in this fic. The author seemed to subvert tropes a bit, but it was published in 2010 so to be fair the cliche tropes aren't too bad you should give it a try.
