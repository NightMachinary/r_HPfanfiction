Poor excuses, Yes maybe all you mention can justify being jealous but the fact that he didn't ask for forgiveness afterwards and waited until after the first task is unjustifiable.

And as for the horcrux hunt, bear in mind that Harry and Hermione was equal in wearing the locket with Ron and yet they didn't leave or complain about their seemingly impossible quest. Also remember that Ron has been complaining throughout the journey about the situation. How they don't have a specific goal or how abysmal their food situation was. Ron also kept expecting Hermione to always cook the food and doesn't offer to do it himself. Overall he was spoiled by his mum and that trait made the journey even more worse.
