How about you stop assigning blame and actually think about the characters. Why they do not have to worry about their loved ones in this war matters fuck all. Only the fact THAT they don't have ties to people in acute danger. They don't lie awake at night imagining the horrible things that could be happen RIGHT NOW to their siblings/parents.
