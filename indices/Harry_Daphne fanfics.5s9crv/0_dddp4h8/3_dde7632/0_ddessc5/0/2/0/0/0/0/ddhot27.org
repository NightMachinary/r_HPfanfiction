You're joking right? You think Harry and Hermione don't worry about the others as well? Like Remus, Tonks, the Weasleys? You make them sound like they don't care about them at all but at least they are channeling their worry into completing the quest. And they don't go around hurting the other as well like Ron was doing. Ron's always been a hothead and his mouth say hurtful things before he could think properly. We know he probably don't mean it but the fact that he does those things are undeniable. What ticks me more is that Harry forgives him easily so Ron never really learns to apologize properly for his mistakes. Harry refuse to let him apologize after his abandonment in 4th year. And again during the hocrux hunt when he just shove the issue of Ron leaving them as if it's not a big deal when it really is. They should had to talk about it to properly clear things out. All three of them should have. At least Hermione made it clear that what he did was not forgotten when she gave him a silent treatment unlike Harry who was acting like everything was fine after Ron came back.
