Look, my life sucked compared to the one of my best friend. Now I know that his isn't perfect either but he get's the money and the girls. But am I jealous? No, and honestly I cannot recall anytime I was.

When I was fourteen I certainly wished to have his luck with the ladies but I never did resent his success. And I still don't. Much like Ron, I could be in a better situation if I would apply myself but I have no one to blame besides me. I don't nag my friends to do my work or stop them from getting better at something because I would much rather play a game or talk about sports.

Ron was a deserter and I remember one paragraph from a fic I have recently read. Paraphrased it says something along the lines

"Desertion from the military carries the highest penalty. Desertion of a sprouse leads to a loss of trust. It is not simply forgiven. Under no circumstances Harry and Hermione would welcome Ron back after what he did. And he deserted them more than once."
