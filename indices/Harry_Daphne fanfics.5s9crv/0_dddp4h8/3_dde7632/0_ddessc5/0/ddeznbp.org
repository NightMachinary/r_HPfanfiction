People just love to hate on Ron don't they?

Ron was FOURTEEN when he became envious of Harry's fame and fortune. Try to empathize with the guy. His family's poor, he has six succesful and more popular brothers, and his best friend is the most famous wizard in Britain. Those are some pretty easy ways to develop deep insecurities.

About abandoning Harry during the horcrux hunt: Ron had been wearing the locket for a long time. I don't need to remind you the insidious and destructive power of the horcruxes as you need only to look at the effects of the diary. Blaming Ron for leaving is like blaming Ginny for being possessed.
