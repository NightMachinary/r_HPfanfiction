It honestly is and I feel like it hardly contributes anything to the story. Ron's desertion makes sense to highlight the power of the horcrux and how it can infiltrate your mind, but people always forget that he left because of the horcrux's influence not because he's a shitty person; that's why Harry and Hermione Forgave him so easily.
