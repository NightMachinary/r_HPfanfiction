Honestly if you're going to blame anyone for that blame JKR. In the first three books we see Ron go after the stone with Harry and Hermione, go into the Forbidden Forest and confront his greatest fear, and tell Sirius he'd have to kill all of them to get to Harry. Ron's betrayal in GoF kind of comes out of left field.
