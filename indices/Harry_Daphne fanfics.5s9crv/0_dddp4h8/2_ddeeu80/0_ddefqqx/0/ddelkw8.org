Well yeah sure, but Harry Potter is escapism/fantasy, I don't read it for realistic characters. Just to avoid misunderstanding: Of course they have to be believable and internally consistent, just not mundane. The amount of realistic characters in HP I can probably count on 1 hand.

Books about teenagers and their dumbass problems is AFAIK a whole other literary genre (and the only time I will ever have read it is for school). It's no surprise to me that the parts of HBP that people complain most about are those that went in that direction too much...
