Out of general curiosity, if it's not too much to ask, what about Harry lead to the 'absolute best Harry personality and mannerism wise'. The general commentary I get most often on the story isn't typically favorable of Harry.

My goal with it was to make them both act their age, and make them both make mistakes, and more often than not I was just told how stupid it was that they instantly in love, how Harry was weak and stupid and not focused nearly enough on the war, and how Daphne was a slut that didn't deserve Harry.
