Wow, nice to meet you. Vitam Paramus and The Pureblood princess are two of my favourite fics!

I read a lot of fanfiction, and my biggest gripe is that authors are so focused on making their characters idealistic, that they completely throw out any possibility of them being realistic. And that's just what Harry's and Daphne's relationship is, realistic.

Harry is a lot of the time written as some sexy charmer that knows the ins and outs of romance, but on the contrary he's actually totally clueless about romance. See his fumblings eith Cho, and how long it took him to get together with Ginny.

How Harry interacts with Daphne is something I could totally see him doing in the actual novels. You managed to reach the perfect balance between realism and idealism thst allows the reader to relate to Harry or Daphne but at the same time really like Harry.

Looking back at my answer I feel really dissatisfied with it; I feel like I gave you a really general answer. If you agree just let me know, I don't mind discussing this at all.

Now here's the part where I beg for a sequel based on the last chapter in Harry's pov.
