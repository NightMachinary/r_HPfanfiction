Well, I mean, I never say no to talking about my stuff. I just received what I felt were an alarming amount of comments along the lines of how the leads were horrible, how they were unlikable, how they were shallow. And I wondered if i failed at portraying the dynamic of two young teens that both didn't really understand how a relationship evolves, and both don't really know what to do.

There won't ever be a sequel. There are only epilogues because I lost bets. And have since learned to stop wagering fanfiction on sports games.
