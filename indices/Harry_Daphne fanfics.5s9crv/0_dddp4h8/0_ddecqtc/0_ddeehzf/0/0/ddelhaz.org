Wow it's almost like you wrote them as real people with real flaws.

Look man, there's a reason why authors like robst and stories like HPMOR have tons of fans. The characters (specifically Harry) are not all realistic. Yeah maybe those people want a Harry that isn't superficial, doesn't to have sex with Daphne because it's not honourable, never makes any mistakes, and is able to make the correct choices in every situtation, but the fact is that kind of Harry is fake and just insulting to thr Harry Rowling wrote.

You can't ever please everyone and unfortunately the people you don't please will be so much more vocal than those you please. Take me, I absolutely loved your stories, but I never left any reviews because it's just not something I do. I guess I should change that habit and show more greatfulness for authors. Now, say I absolutely hated a fic. I'd be pretty likely to pm the author with a scathing review.
