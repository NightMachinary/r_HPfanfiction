I never got the part with honour and sex. Not sleeping with someone because they are drunk is honourable. Several hundred teenagers locked in a castle without any real supervision and not having sex is bullshit.

Even worse are those time travel fics where both travel back in time and still want to have sex but decide to wait until they are adults. I get it that shagging your wife in her eleven year old body might be an issue for some but when they are fourteen, which is the age of consent in half of Europe, it becomes ridiculous.
