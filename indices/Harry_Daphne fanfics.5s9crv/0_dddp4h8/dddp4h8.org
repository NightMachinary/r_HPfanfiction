I don't know about you but I hate the whole betrayed!Harry that has a mentor show him the true ever lemon drop offering evil!Dumbledore and how the Weasleys have used alove potions on Harry to make him fall in love with Ginny. Harry then stops by Gringotts, learns he has another vault, the goblins remove a magical block on him and and make him a new basilisk wand. Finally he stops by Hogwarts and declares Daphne Greengrass, the schools ice princess (whatever that means) and declares her as his wife, then disapparates out of Hogwarts shocking everyone that he can break the anti-apparation wards.

Anyways sorry for the rant. But if you want a realistic story, with realistic characters, emotions and romance, not to mention the absolute best Harry personality and mannerism wise I've ever read, definitely read:
