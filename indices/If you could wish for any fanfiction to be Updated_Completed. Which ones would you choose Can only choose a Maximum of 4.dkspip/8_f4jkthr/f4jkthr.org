!linkffn(Error of Soul)

!linkffn(Amplitude, Frequency, and Resistance)

These two are the best soul bond fics out there, and they're both abandoned. I would love to see them continued and eventually finished.

!linkffn(Devil take the Hindmost)

I'm a sucker for Harry/Voldemort romance, and the concept that this story works with by making it so that the horcrux connection meant that Voldemort was constantly in contact with Harry and was the only person who gave her any sort of affection as she grew up, heavily endearing her to him.

!linkffn(Warning Signs Read Desolation)

This story is an absolutely brilliant work that takes a very different approach to all sides of the war without bashing any of them.
