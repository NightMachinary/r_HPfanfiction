There are way too many, but here are 4 that I feel we are unlikely to see updates or completions anytime soon, that haven't yet been mentioned in this thread, but I'd really like to see finished.

linkffn(Anticlockwise) A time travelling story from the perspective of an unaware non-time traveller.

linkffn(Deathly Hallowed) A well-crafted horror story.

linkffn(The Lesser Sadness) in spite of it being incomplete, this is my favorite OP!Harry story.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10849210/1/Harry-Potter-Lord-of-the-Swamp]]) Harry inherits a swamp.
