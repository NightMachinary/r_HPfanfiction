linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elemental Changes by Peeves' Best Friend)

The best elemental fic, ashamed its abandoned. Has a very good WBWL story and an amazing Dumbledore also.

linkffn(Resurgence by Arcturus Peverell)

Great Dark Harry fic with good conflict and it gets very good around the end.

linkffn(Lightning Dragons Roar by Zero Rewind)

This always gives me depression. Suck an amazing fic. Always makes me cry when I reach the end. For fucks sake!

EDIT: I hadn't realised but it updated silently on October 7th this year. Author is updating again, which means this one is gooooooooood. Haven't been this excited since Endgame trailer 1 came out last December.

And finally linkffn(A Game of Style and Brutality by BarneyXII)

A banger. Best sports fic, has me on the edge of my seat every time but nooooo it has to abandoned.

These are 4 fics out of the dozens I wish to be finished. HONORABLE mentions are The Closer you looks which is Now You See Me but in Harry Potter.

I swear these would be my Genie wishes, and if I won the Lottery my money all of it would go towards finding the Authors and making them write, even if they are dead I'll find a way. Because that is my season arc, even if it takes nine seasons for them to upload that what I'll do.

Thank you for listening to my Ted Talk.

BONUS Harry Potter Rise from Dust. Shame it hasn't updated
