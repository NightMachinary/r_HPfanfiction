Some time ago I went on a binge of these stories (and I've listed the ones I read below). Sadly, they all sort of mush together to the point I don't really remember what I liked and what was horrible. I mean some (like Erebus Ferrox Riddle) are obviously not going to be great but beyond that.... I do remember liking Family Matters (or at least the early chapters)? One that is updating still, and therefore still in my mind is Benefits of old laws; which you should check out if you want adopted stories. It has some pretty good characterization and Harry doesn't immediately turn "Dark", he in fact struggles with even liking LV who treats him so much better then anyone else has.
