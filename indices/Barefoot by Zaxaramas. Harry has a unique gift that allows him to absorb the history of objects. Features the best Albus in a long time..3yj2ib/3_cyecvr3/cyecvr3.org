Only skimmed over the first chapter by now since I'm too busy to try actually reading it, but it seems to have that unfortunate thing where the author capitalises certain words that should not be capitalised in the context they are in (“Aunt”, “Uncle”).

Still, that's minor stuff. Here's to hoping it has no high-tier nonsense, so to say.
