  It's about a witch going to a magical school. It's similar to the original Harry Potter in that regard. We get to see some new kinds of spells, and she has a very smart familiar that is more involved in the plot than a mere owl. There's really no reason for me to spoiler you, though, just read the books and see if you like them. You should be able to see the quality of writing for yourself
