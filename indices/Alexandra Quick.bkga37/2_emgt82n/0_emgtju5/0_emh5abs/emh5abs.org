Have you read Miranda Flairgold's fics? That's another set that starts off with the canonical magic system, but then builds on it and aside from brief diversions to handle canonical events that are no longer major difficulties, has an entirely different plot and a threat that far eclipses that of Voldemort. It's interesting if you want something significantly different from Hogwarts, though it gets a bit silly sometimes making itself different.
