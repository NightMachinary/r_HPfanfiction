It can, there are certainly many war novels in the Muggle world, which are very good, but I am sorry to say it (I really liked “The Accidental Animagus” a lot) [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/another-comments-on-the-accidental-animagus-al.html][neither “Animagus at War“ nor “Divided and Entwined” are one of those]]. What I can discern from the great war novels (e.g., “For Whom the Bell Tolls”, “All Quiet on the Western Front” or my beloved “A Bell for Adano”) the key to writing a war novel is that you don't write about all those battles from the bird's eye view, but you just pick one (or few) characters and follow them through those battles never letting your eyes fly too high. Actually, if I understand it correctly (I have never read the whole book) “All Quiet on the Western Front” is written as the obvious critique of the top view (how down in the trenches the reality was very different).

Why then both of these fics let the personal stories (that's what I meant that I missing more talks about Neville × Hermione relationship, Harry catching a mouse, or the love triangle in “Divided and Entwined”) slide somewhere to the back burner and they are now mostly ignored? Those are the stories which are most interesting, newspaper-like descriptions of the battles should be left to newspapers (characters read them in the morning after the battle) and kept just to few paragraphs.

See also [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][this post]] about the structure of plot: the only thing which is interesting is how Harry, Hermione and others navigate through those battles, battles themselves can just stand as the background. And that is true even for the large Hollywood blockbuster war films. During the “Return of the King”, in The Battle of the Pelennor Fields all those giant elephants were just background for the real stories we are following: those of Théoden, Aragorn, Éowyn, or hobbits. Those little stories are the ones which carry whole emotional load of the story there (which is for example the reason why Legolas and Gandalf were so bland in that battle, despite all their jumping on the elephant or riding of the horse through the streets of Minas Tirith; they were just part of the background, there was too little of their own real story).
