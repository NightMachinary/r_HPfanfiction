Tom Clancy's Red Storm Rising (WWIII in the early 80s) manages some top down really well by having the PoV of a general who wasn't really on board with the war plan but then does his best to make everything work as intended. Or the captain of a ship whose convoy is attacked. And I've read a few decent top-down battles over on alternate history, but those also used a King's PoV rather than an omnipresent narrator.

But to be honest, the initial comment was mostly a joke with a nod towards the storytelling of Joakim Broden (the front man of Sabaton), who have an album about the 30y war and the Great Northern.
