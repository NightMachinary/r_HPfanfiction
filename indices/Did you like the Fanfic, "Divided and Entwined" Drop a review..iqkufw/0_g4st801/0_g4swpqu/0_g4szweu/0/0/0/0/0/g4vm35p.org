My issue isn't with your opinion on the battle scenes - that's your opinion, and you're entitled to it; tastes vary, I can't stand overly "duelling" battle scenes where everyone uses clever spells in the middle of combat, instead of sensible tactics - but I take issue with the claim that I write "top down" battles. That's not true. And as I said - the focus is on how the brutal civil war changes people. OC Aurors, Daphne and Tracey, Draco, Hermione, Harry, Ron, Fred and George - none of them go through the war unscathed, and all of them have to struggle with the temptation to take a few more steps on the road to hell. One character, for example, goes from opposing bigots to following Voldemort because of the war. Then you have muggleborns who become bigots. And then, when the war ends, all those people have to sort out the peace.
