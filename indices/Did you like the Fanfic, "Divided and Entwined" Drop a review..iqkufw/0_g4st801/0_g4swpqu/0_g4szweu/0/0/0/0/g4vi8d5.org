I am really sorry for not providing more thorough review of your story, but I would have dive into it and spend more time with it than I have, and more effort than I care about it, to be frank.

My overwhelming feeling from the story is the repetitive battle scenes were too similar, too impersonal, and after some time they began to be plainly boring. I think that the substory of the love triangle between Harry, Ron, and Hermione is dragged for too long without much life in it, and it seemed like missing a personal angle in whole story.
