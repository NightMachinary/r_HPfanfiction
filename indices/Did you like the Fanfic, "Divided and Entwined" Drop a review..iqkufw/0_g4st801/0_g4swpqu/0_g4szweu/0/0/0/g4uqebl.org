I don't know how you think I deliver top-down descriptions of battles - I write in 3rd person limited and I use both the fog of war and tunnel vision in battle. And Divided and Entwined is all about how the war affects the people involved - how some go from being decent people to bigoted murderers, and others avoid falling that low.
