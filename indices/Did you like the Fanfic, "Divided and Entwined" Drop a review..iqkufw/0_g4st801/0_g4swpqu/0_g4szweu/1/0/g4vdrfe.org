That's a good question. It was some time I read Lady Archimedes (which I think is an excellent story) so I may not remember everything perfectly, but as far as I do, it was very personal story of Hermione (and some other minor characters, dimly remember Ron and Harry with Ginny; the battle with Bellatrix was something really memorable) and through those lens we saw the battle. Which is exactly what I meant as one good way how to approach this problem of non-personal battle.

Concerning Animagus at War, I don't have that many objections against the Battle of Hogwarts (there was some story of Harry), but I was really disappointed with The Battle of Prague (on the other hand, you have brownie points for noticing there are other cities in Europe than Paris, that is very rare; and of course, greetings from Prague!) and The Battle of Czarnoksiesto. I just cannot make myself care about those, and it seems I shouldn't care: they are just filling to drag good guys to deeper and deeper hole and trying to keep attention of readers for as long as possible (and not being too easy on good guys; this is just an opposite ... beating them down for no good reason whatsoever). The result is that I am just skipping over the last chapters, whether you stopped fooling around and started the story again. Apparently not yet.

I am sorry, if I am too discouraging, I don't meant to be. It is just my disappointment, how a good story fell short of my expectations (and I really liked the original Accidental Animagus, although it has some empty chapters as well ... I still don't understand what was the purpose of meeting between Harry and Dudley in the amusement park).
