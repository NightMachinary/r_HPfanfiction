I also liked Reign of the Serpent, but be aware that even if it's quite long it's still abandoned. I don't think there was a cliffhanger, but I definitely wanted more when I was through with it lol

Somebody also mentioned the Firebird trilogy.. that qualifies, but its also... problematic in my opinion. I managed to make it about halfway through the first installment before I noped out.
