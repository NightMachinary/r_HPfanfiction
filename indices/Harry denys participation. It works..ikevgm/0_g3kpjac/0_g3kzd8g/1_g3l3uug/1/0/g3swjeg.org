That would work, as the wiki says, "However, when the curse struck Voldemort and succeeded in causing his biological death, he described the curse as having ripped his soul from his body." Thus, if it hit the curse-scar which held Voldie's soul fragment, THAT would be ripped from the body and not Harry's soul.
