Its not a very common thing, no. Unfortunately like Jayebird said it's a major spoiler for the climax of the one that uses it best (in my opinion), and reading it knowing that that particular twist is coming blows it as early as the first act. Sorry ahead of time for not letting you get that on your own.

On a completely unrelated note, I posted in another thread about my favorite fics which you should read because they're all good and not a single one of them was spoiled by this post.[[https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5p1lo2/cmv_harry_potter_has_an_awful_magic_system_which/dco67dp/][Link]] ;)
