I prefer "S.S. SSSsssssss", but then again those sort of ship names fell out of use at least a decade ago.

I think most people don't use that sort of shorthand for HP/LV or HP/TMR pairings, however I can say I've seen it referred to as Pottermort whereas, like mergirl said, Harrymort is more like Ginnymort/Riddlebottom and refers to a fusing of the souls.
