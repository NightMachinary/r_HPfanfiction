Sorry, I have no clue. Those stories aren't very common to begin with (don't know why, it's a great setup for OP Harry), and I don't think there's a common fanon term for that trope. Actually, I'm not certain people will actually use "Harrymort" in fic if they're talking about the fusion of Harry and his horcrux. It's definitely used in discussions and maybe in ANs, but never in the fic itself, since it's not really narratively appropriate.

I guess the best way to find these stories is to do what this sub does best: ask for recs. :P
