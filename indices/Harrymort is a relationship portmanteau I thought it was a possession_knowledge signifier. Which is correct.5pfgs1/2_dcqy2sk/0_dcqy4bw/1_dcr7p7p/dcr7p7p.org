Well, if you do not mind having to shovel some much before you get anything of worth, you might want to take a look at FFN's HP communities; there just might be one with stories of this kind. I would have given you a link instead of just saying “go look” but the last few times I'd actually delved into that I'd only been paying attention to specific things so I didn't notice anything and that doesn't mean anything.

Other than that, if you know any stories that have this kind of stuff that are on AO3, you can use that to go on a tag mining trip (or you can do that blind, assuming you have some horror protection pills).

That said, I know of three stories with this kind of thing. One is “Seventh Horcrux”, which you've obviously read because everyone has, the second is “At the Hands of the Other” (knowledge, but not possession), which you've probably read as well, and the last one is “Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality” (possession, but not knowledge) which, read or not, you are most likely aware of and already have an opinion about so I'm only mentioning it for the sake of completion.
