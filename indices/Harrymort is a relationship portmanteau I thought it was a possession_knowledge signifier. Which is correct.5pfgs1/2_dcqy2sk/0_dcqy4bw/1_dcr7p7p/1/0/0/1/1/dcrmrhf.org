The merging is in my queue to read already.

I don't do m/m slash or girl-who-lived stories because the few i deigned to read always began "vernon dursley, uncle of hari potter, grunted as he spewed inside the emotionless seven year old girl. As he stood and wiped himself clean on her clothing, telling her to get dressed and start cleaning, tears streamed from her vivid green orbs and down her flawless face, marred only by a discreet lightning shaped scar." Rape isn't good storytelling and always seems to be done for 'shock' value with fem!harry and since it's always done, it doesn't shock.

I'll check out accidental and chrysalis. And try to find this lesser evil.
