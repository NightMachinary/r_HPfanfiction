Yeah, comedies tend to be a bit cliche, alas (like the story you tried and declared cliche a bit ago).

That said, you may or may not have seen it but [[/u/Murderous_squirrel][u/Murderous_squirrel]] replied to my comment too and mentioned a story called “Lesser Evil”; I don't remember reading it so I cannot comment about the quality or even the genre, but it might just be what you are looking for.
