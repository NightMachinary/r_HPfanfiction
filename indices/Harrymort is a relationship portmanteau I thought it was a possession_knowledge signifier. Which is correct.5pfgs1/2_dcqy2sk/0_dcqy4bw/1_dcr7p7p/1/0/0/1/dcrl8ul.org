Harry Potter & the Accidental Horcrux, linkffn(11762850), and its sequel, Harry Potter & the Chrysalis, linkffn(12278649), have the talking horcrux. I presume you've read Hit the Ground Running because it used to be recommended rather often.

linkffn(9911469), Lily and the Art of being Sisyphus, has an active horcrux, iirc. Same goes for linkffn(6163339), "Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness", which is slash.

linkffn(9720211), The Merging, kind of has what you want, but it's pretty gradual.
