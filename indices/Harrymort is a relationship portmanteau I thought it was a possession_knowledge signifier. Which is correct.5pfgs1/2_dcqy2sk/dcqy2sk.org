It's used both ways, though really only the HP/LV shippers will call it harrymort. I don't think I've seen it used to refer to the pairing outside of pairing fics/discussion. (To be fair, it's waaaaay better than the HP/TMR portmanteau, which is tomarry and never fails to make me cringe, it's so awkward. But there's really no better alternative.)
