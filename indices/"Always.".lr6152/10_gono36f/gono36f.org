I think it's always worth pointing out that James and Lily must have married as teenagers during a war and died around age 21. Snape would have been around that age too. Sirius got thrown in Azkaban and was probably a bit nuts after the constant torture. Remus was basically not wanted in wizarding society and lost his two rich friends who supported him.

Basically Snape had an opportunity to grow up that many others did not.

He was basically free of Voldemort and legal consequences for what he did.

He didn't take his chance to do much to benefit anyone at all until the end of Harry's fourth year when he goes back to being a spy.
