Always is sweet, sure, but it's Severus's thing for Lily. I'm not a Snape-hater, no, but I don't think of the guy as an angel. He was an arsehole that needed therapy, but I digress. Authors should find another phrase for their relationships. James's phrase for Lily was "until the very end", which is cute, too. I once read a fic where "Ride or die" was the phrase for Tom and Harry. I won't get into that, either, since my shipping choices are often picked apart in fandom. But, well, that's a cute phrase, too. Since Tom was emotionally constipated, that phrase pretty much means "I love you" for them until Tom got his head out of his arse. There are other phrases people could use. Or maybe you could make one. Phrases like that should be unique. It could be something like "Until the end of eternity" or "My love for you shines as bright as all the stars in existence" or whatnot. Find something. It should be short, sweet, and memorable. Using "always" gets a bit annoying sometimes. I don't hate it, but it's overdone.
