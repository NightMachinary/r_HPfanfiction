I know it was probably meant to be some hackneyed thing about a forever love and all that, but honestly, with how badly she wrote Snape as this tortured antihero, I prefer to think that Snape always has this guilt about sentencing her to death. He's responsible for her death. In his mind, James was a horrible bully who he still thinks tried to set him up to die by werewolf, and isn't as fussed - but Lily was a good friend that he had loved, and he essentially was responsible for her and her husband dying. So yeah, he's still 100% motived by Lily and always will be - because it's his fault her son needs protection.
