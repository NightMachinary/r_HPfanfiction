What puzzles me the most when I see Snape utter this quote is when I read fics that pair him with someone else in postwar. Like, why would you repeat a quote as infamous at that to someone who isn't even Lily in first place? That's like if he said "yeah sure I like you but I'll always love a dead woman who I never even had a relationship with more".

And I actually like reading Snape-centric generally.
