My argument is mostly satire of a lot of people's arguments that this is what redeems Snape.

Redemption is earned, not just by feelings but by actions, and in the books Snape didn't particularly do things to redeem himself. He died in a war that took lots of actual innocents too and he spent most of the years prior abusing children and in particular abusing a child he helped orphan.
