There was one fic I read ages ago (forgot the name) where Snape genuinely only said it because of pressure from other Slytherin's and he apologised, which is great but even then I found it strange that they ended up getting married (their relationship had gone on in-story for a few years). It wasn't the main pairing but it showed up fairly often within the story.
