Fanfiction often makes Snape a lot more palatable and redeemable than he originally was. It even makes him romantic. In reality, he was /obsessed/.

And yeah --- been there, done that. Teenage hormones are one hell of a drug. But Snape never really grew out of it and let this emotion dominate his entire life. I understand that he was traumatized and coping, and he hadn't had the easiest life, but Merlin's pants --- enough is enough sometimes.

Snape is not a good person. He is a product of his environment, and it's not all his fault, but quite a bit of it is. His actions are still heroic, and he deserves recognition, but probably not redemption for everything he did.

I have yet to see a Snape character study that would get his voice /right/ while having him as a protagonist.
