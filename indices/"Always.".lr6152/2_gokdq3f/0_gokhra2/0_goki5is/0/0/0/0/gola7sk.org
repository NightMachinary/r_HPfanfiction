Well, that's on me not looking into the character tags on FFN... It's a Snily story, isn't it? Because I'm on chapter 15 and she just happily declared her love for the man 27 years her senior. Which she knows about. Yikes.

Before I get invested any further, will the fic actually confront this fact? They acknowledge it, which is already good for PeggySue, but I just think it's way OOC for Severus to just brush something like this under the rug.

And yes, I understand that it's in-character for Lily to see the best in people, while Severus can be a selfish asshole and desperate for any positive reinforcement from her... but that's not the vibe I'm getting. I'd really like to be wrong.
