  I have yet to see a Snape character study that would get his voice right while having him as a protagonist.

I'm curious about which stories you've gone through as samples?

The Peace Not Promised really gets inside his head, albeit it's a Peggy Sue story, so it's his adult self reliving his teenage years. Still bitter, cutting, harsh, loathing himself and not being a big fan of most other people either, yet devoted to Lily's wellbeing - and able to prioritise, too, not just wanting her to himself, but wanting her to be well and happy even if that means being separated from him, much as that's not his ideal outcome. He's definitely co-dependent, yet he does very gradually become a better person as a result of being around her. (Also, it has a clever and appropriate use of "Always".)

Come Once Again and Love Me plays up his misanthropy and the emotion-suppressing effects of Occlumency, and I didn't like it as much, but it has excellent prose quality. Whether you think his distance from Lily is more or less in character is up to you, I guess.
