What kind of confrontation were you looking for? They do wait until she's of age to get married, and would have waited longer except that her father passes away unexpectedly, leaving her with little left after the house is sold to pay debts - so she persuades Severus that if she's starting from nothing, she'd rather do it together than alone. And apart from just after their wedding, their time from then until graduation is celibate, rather against Lily's wishes, because he's too aware of her being the right age to have been his student.

Their relationship is certainly not flawless; the narrative shows them run into miscommunications, personality clashes, and sometimes conflicts in what they value. And Severus is very aware of their age gap, and feels it keenly, but as you might imagine, he wants her too much to break up on that basis unless that's what /she/ wants, which it isn't. So he feels guilty about it, but doesn't walk away.
