Yeah Lily hadn't been friends with Snape for around 6 years its just creepy . I don't think Lily would forgiven Snape at all, she probably never even thought of him in those 6 years unless it was bad things and she would hold the same disdain for him as any other Death eater.

I wonder sometimes what some of the other muggleborn who got called mud blood by Snape thought about Lily hanging around with a racist I doubt they would think to highly of her.
