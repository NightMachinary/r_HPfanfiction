You don't need to have a strictly romantic interest in someone to be threatened by them potentially having romantic feelings for someone. It's more complicated than that. Lily was a lot more to Snape than just a close friend. For him, she was the first and only good thing in his life, the light in the darkness, the only respite he had from an abusive childhood. His feelings were a platonic idealisation of the goodness she represented to him as a child. What James represented was someone taking that away from him, taking away the only bit of goodness that Snape had ever known.

There are plenty of friendships where one friend becomes jealous and possessive once their friends start dating someone, because they're afraid that they're no longer important to that person. For someone like Snape who already was solely dependent on Lily, this would have increased ten fold, especially since James was his enemy whom he already didn't feel he could measure up against (which is why he panics about him being a Quidditch hero). He was afraid that he was losing his place in Lily's life and becoming unimportant.
