I can buy that it became platonic years after Lily ended their friendship but I don't buy that it's "strictly" platonic for the entirety of their time as friends.

If so why doesn't he hate Sirius more than James. Sirius was the one who sent him to the willow. James saved his life. Even in the conversation after the werewolf incident he's way more obsessed with James than Sirius (Potter and his mates, big quidditch hero, he fancies you!). In SWM, both James and Sirius were equally enthusiastic about bullying Snape so I don't buy that James bullied him more and that's why Snape's more obsessed with James.

He felt threatened that James was interested in Lily and Lily would like him back.
