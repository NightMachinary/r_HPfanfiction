I always felt it was misunderstood in general anyway.

I don't think it's supposed to come off as a romantic ideal from Snape in canon, as it is frequently interpreted. Snape is never portrayed as being a rational, romantic character. He is vindictive, petty and obsessive.

He is obsessed by his love for Lily Potter, even for so long after her death. It's not healthy for him, and has been portrayed as such. He's a bitter, angry man who bullies 11 year olds in his care, because he is unable to get over his obsession. It has done him no favours.

If he could only have gotten over his obsession, he would have had a chance at being happy by himself or with someone else, but he never could. He is not a romantic character, he is a tragic character.
