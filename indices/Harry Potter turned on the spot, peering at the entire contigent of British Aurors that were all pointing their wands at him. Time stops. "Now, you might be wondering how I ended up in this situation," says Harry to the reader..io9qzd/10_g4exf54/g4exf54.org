Harry Potter turned on the spot, peering at the entire contingent of British Aurors that were all pointing their wands at him. Time stops. "Now, you might be wondering how I ended up in this situation," says Harry to the reader.

"Wel... It all started with a niffler..."

X amount of time earlier... What? This author is lazy and can't think of timey wimy stuff ok! Good. As I was saying, x amount of time earlier...

See Harry Potter, a little short, skinny teen of around 15, look at him, look at his messy hair, his glasses, no not Eye glasses as those Silly Americans call them but propper British glasses, anyway, his glasses, his eyes, green as... Green things... And his small hands.

Said small hands are about to rob a Niffler from the pet shop, pealing letters over the door say, 'The pet shop, because we couldn't be bothered with a fancy name...'

The story continues from there but I can't think of any way to string the events together.

They go a little something like this: As harry is running out of the shop with the Niffler, the woman, womaning the counter, yells after him, "It's not worth it you know. Little fucker tried to bite my finger off and all because of my ring!"

Harry finds ron and Hermione, Ron thinks it's Bloody brilliant Harry got the niffler, after all, the amount of gold and shiny things the little creature would steal would be huge, hermione... Well, she's just standing there smoking, cause she's going to fucking smoke and no one can stop her! Apart from her parents but they're not here now are they, muahahahahhaha /coughs/ ahahahaha!

So the niffler robs the ministry and people realise their stuff is missing, the niffler gets caught and Harry somehow is surrounded by aurors.
