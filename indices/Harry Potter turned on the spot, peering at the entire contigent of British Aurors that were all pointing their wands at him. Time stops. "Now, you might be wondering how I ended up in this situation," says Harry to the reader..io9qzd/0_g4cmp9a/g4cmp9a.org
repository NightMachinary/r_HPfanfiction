"Now, you might be wondering how I ended up in this situation. Well, I should start at the beginning."

/A scene of Hogwarts pops up/

"A long time ago there was a very nice redhead named Lily and a not so nice -- but he gets better -- brunette named James. Anyways, they happened to fall in love. And when a mommy witch loves a daddy wizard very much... Ok wait. This might be /too/ far back. Let me start again."

"Ah, there, that's better. Ok now, you see, everything goes back to this one moment when I said something incredibly stupid."

/Harry looks at Griphook, smiles, and says "Thanks for your help."/

"Yeah, that? You see that? That was stupid. O' course, I didn't know it at the time, but no wizard had thanked a goblin in 200 years. Things... Things quickly spiralled. And now I'm accidentally waging the second goblin war. Which, funnily enough, isn't actually the reason the ministry is chasing me. It's actually because we've been dressing veelas in skimpy outfits and having them sing as show girls to boost troop moral. The British are just angry they can't watch."
