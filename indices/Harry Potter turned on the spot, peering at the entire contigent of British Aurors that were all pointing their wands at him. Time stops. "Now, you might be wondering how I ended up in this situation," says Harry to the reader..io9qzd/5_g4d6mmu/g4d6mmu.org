I'm a registered seer. I woke up in this body five years ago. Since then, I have been... informing (read as trolling) the magical world by sending pensieve memories of the future via the movies to the British DMLE, the ICW, and the Daily Prophet.

Voldemort may be gone right now, but boredom struck. Last week I had the whole Magical World grieving after I showed Dumbledore's death. Then, a riot broke out in Diagon Alley when Dumbledore showed up to buy his Sherbet Lemons. Apparently people thought he was a necromantic construct.

Last night? I sent out enough memories of Fudge to cause the "election board" to show up.

The joke is on them though, this is a muggle diner and next to me is an ICW inspector.
