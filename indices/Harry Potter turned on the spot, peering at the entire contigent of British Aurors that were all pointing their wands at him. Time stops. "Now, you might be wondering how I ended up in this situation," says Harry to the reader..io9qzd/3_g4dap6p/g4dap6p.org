"Well we should probably start at the beginning."

An image pops up of a redhead bent over a kitchen counter.

"TO FAR!"

The image fast forwards to a 16 year old strutting through diagon ally. A shit eating grin plastered over his face.

"See that handsome little shit? Yeah, thats me. 16 years old and already the most powerful asshat at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. Or at least I thought I was. Oh, I should probably explain that. I'm a wizard, you see. Yeah like with magic and junk. The whole things over rated of you ask me but, hey, ladies love a little wand action from time to time." He snickered at his own bad joke.

The boy was unceremoniously knocked into by a burly wizard who rushed past him. The blow forcing him to stumble and fall. The image froze just as he was about to plow into a short blond girl who had just exited the book shop.

"You see that girl I'm about to crash into? Short, blonde, legs for days and as beautiful as the morning sun? That's Daphne Greengrass. I didn't know it then but I was about to meet the love of my life. I also didn't know i was about to meet the most obstinate, hard headed, self absorbed five foot three inches OF PAIN IN MY ASS that I would ever know! But that's not important. Our meeting? That was just a coincidence. What, you thought this was a love story? No my friend, This the story about how I became the leader of the world's largest magical drug cartel, sold millions of gallions of counterfeit art to the goblins and started a goblin war, and finally defrauded the largest bank in Paris. In just fifteen short minutes I will be running from Gringots BLEEDING FROM THE FACE and straight into the arms of the one woman who stood beside me through it all."

My name is Harry James Potter. So strap in fuck-nuts, because this shit is about to get weird.
