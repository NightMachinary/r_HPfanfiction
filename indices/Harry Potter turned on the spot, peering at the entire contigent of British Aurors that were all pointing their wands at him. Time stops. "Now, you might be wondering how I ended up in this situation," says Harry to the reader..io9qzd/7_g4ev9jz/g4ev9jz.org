Well it all started 7 years ago, in the summer of 91.

/Rewind to Privet Drive as All Star fades in/

Somebody once told me the wizard world would troll me\\
I aint the smartest ghoul in the shed.\\
He was lookin' kinda Dumb-ledore, sickle in a pumpkin core\\
And Snape with a spell to his deathbed.

Well the seers start coming and they don't stop coming\\
Fed to the duels and I hit the ground stunning\\
Didn't make sense I'm the Chosen One\\
Your brain's Hermione but your head is Ron\\
So much to do, So much to see\\
So what's wrong with buying the trolley sweets\\
You'll never know if you don't go\\
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, You're a cursed scar, Get your cloak on, Go slay\\
Hey now, You're the sock star, Dobby's free now, Get paid

And all that slithers is Vold\\
Sorry muggles cant be enrolled.
