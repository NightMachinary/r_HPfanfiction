I want the same, sadly all i seem to find is slash fics :(

Well, actually really just want to see Harry abusing the shit out of having magic. Mokeskin pouches to hold tons of varius goods, transfigured golems/animals to fight zombies, magical zombiekilling traps, treehouse that needs broom to get to. You get the drill. Harry flies around, magicking up transfigured hunting parties everywhere, looting, and doing whatever the hell a zombiekilling Harry does best.. Sadly most of what i have found is angsty, with weak magic that doesnt work against zombies, or transfiguring isnt a thing.. Or Harry suddenly cant use magic.. (thats the fun part!)
