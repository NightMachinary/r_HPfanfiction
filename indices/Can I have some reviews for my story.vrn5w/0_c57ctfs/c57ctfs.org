Well, I went and read your story. Not sure if you meant you want some reviews here or there? Err.. First of all the premise is really interesting. I should warn you that I'm much better at giving criticism than praise, so don't let the following list upset you. I tend to not mention the good things, doesn't mean they're not there. Also forgive me for any English mistakes, I'm ESL.

1. The excerpts from the book. They're too long and in reality, unnecessary. It just makes the reader want to skip to where the story actually starts. For instance, in the first chapter, there's no need to repeat the stuff that doesn't change much word by word. You can just write a paragraph about how they went to the Common Room, or maybe write something completely different instead of just the same as the book with a few details changed due to Flitwick. I know that's the goal of the story, but you can save that for significant events, you know? Pick the scenes that make sense for the story and change them as you see fit according to the premise. The rest, either change significantly or just get rid of it. I guess the first section of chapter two does this better, by devoting one paragraph to Harry's impressions of each class. What I'm trying to say here is, focus on what you want to say, there's no need to recreate the original story word by word.

2. I had a whole paragraph here about the History teacher, but then I noticed you said there is a reason for the change, and it is related to the Flitwick-McGonagall switch. So nevermind! That's good to know.

3. Take this with a grain of salt I guess, but I would tell you to watch out for the Gary Stu-ism, for lack of a better word. Careful not to make things too easy, too good to be true. Why is Flitwick giving Harry an advantage over the other students and helping him cheat with that memory enhancing spell? For him to warn Harry about Snape potentially giving him a hard time, ok I guess. Warn Harry about Snape's teaching style with an advice about what he should already know? Sure. I would expect Flitwick to tell him to go read the book and have it fresh on his mind before the class, not put a spell on him (and only him) that makes him have a super memory. What on earth? Flitwick has always struck me as fair and as a professor who values real work by students, and from his speech on the first chapter he seemed to be the same here. I would have expected this if it was a "Snape as Head of Gryffindor" story or something.

And then Harry goes and manages to throw Snape out of his mind when he's using Legilimency... how? Because of the memory enhancing spell? How does that increase someone's occlumency skills? Eleven-year old Harry shouldn't be an Occlumens prodigy unless you give a reason for him to have that over canon!Harry. How does Flitwick being a Gryffindor give Harry this talent, on the first day of school?

So yeah, watch out so that Flitwick doesn't favor Harry too much, to an unbelievable amount, and if you're gonna change Harry - which makes sense because he wouldn't end up the exact same person under a different Head of House - then you need to make sure these changes happen due to the different Head of House, but in a way that doesn't stretch belief and makes sense in an organic way. No cheating or taking shortcuts.

I think basically this is all I have for now. That note at the end gave me hope that you do have a connection between all components of the story in your mind, but I do think you need to tighten it up a little, because from the first two chapters, I had a different impression. Good luck with your story, I guess. These are just my opinions, I hope you don't get offended. I'm not a writer or anything.
