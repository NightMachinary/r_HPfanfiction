Thanks for all of that! I do have a good reason for the memory-enhancer, by the way, which will be revealed in the next chapter. I won't spoil it, but be assured that Flitwick isn't going to be Snape-esque. I'm curious about your thoughts on the history teacher, so I'd like to hear them unless you were just ranting about the teacher being Binns. As for the legilimency... well, Snape is a better Occlumens than he is a Legilimens, in my opinion. He can get through most shields, but not non-verbally. After all, throughout Harry's occlumency "lessons", he always casts it with a wand and using the incantation, whereas here he did it wandlessly and silently. He didn't have time to break through Harry's (weak) shields, nor could he openly cast a spell on a student. Yeah, he could easily get through Harry's shields if he used his wand and said the spell.
