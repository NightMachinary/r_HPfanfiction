Oh, don't worry about the History teacher thing, it mostly me wondering about the relation between the Flitwick-McGonagall switch up and the teacher being new. Once I saw your Author's Note, I figured it was something you were just saving up for later for a specific reason. And since you're telling me that it's the same case with the memory spell, I think most of my concerns are moot. I do think maybe my first concern (the lenght of the filler paragraphs) is the reason why I got the wrong impression about the rest. If that makes sense.
